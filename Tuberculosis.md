* Bacteria of the *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* complex, is one of the oldest diseases known to affect humans
* Emerged ~70,000 years ago in Africa and subsequently disseminated along with anatomically modern humans, expanding globally during the Neolithic Age as human density started to increase
* Affect the lungs, extra pulmonary in <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">one-third cases</mark>
* Curable especially in drug susceptible strains
* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">untreated has 70% mortality</mark>
* through <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">airborne</mark> spread of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">droplet nuclei</mark>.

# Etiological Agent 
 * family <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Mycobacteriaceae</mark> and the order <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Actinomycetales</mark>
 * No known environmental reservior.
 * the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">most common and important</mark> agent of human disease by far is <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">M. tuberculosis</mark> 

## Other species
 * <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">M. africanum</mark> isolated from <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">West, Central, and East Africa,</mark> closely related to M. tuberculosis 
 * <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">M. bovis</mark>
	 * zoonotic
	 * bovine
	 * resistant to pyrazinamide
	 * important cause of TB transmitted by unpasteurized milk
	 * half of cases are in Africa 
	 * <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">M. caprae</mark> related 
* M. pinnipedii
	* infecting <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">seals and sea lions in the southern hemisphere</mark> and recently isolated from humans 
* M. mungi 
	* isolated from banded mongooses in southern Africa 
* M. orygis 
	* described in oryxes and other Bovidae in Africa and Asia and a potential cause of infection in humans 
* M. microti 
	* the “vole” bacillus, a less virulent organism 
* M. canetti 
	* rare isolate from East African cases that produces unusual smooth colonies on solid media
	* closely related to a supposed progenitor type.

## M. tuberculosis 
* Rod shaped
* non sporing
* thin aerobe
* measuring 0.5 μm by 3 μm
* often <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Gram neutral</mark>
* Acid Fast bacillus 
	* Once stained, cannot be Decolorised by Acid alcohol
	* D/t high content of 
		* Mycolic acid 
		* long-chain cross-linked fatty acids
		* cell wall lipids
	* other species 
		* Nocardia
		* Rhodococcus
		* Legionella micdadei
		* Isospora
		* Cryptosporidium
* Pathogenicity more
	* lipids linked to aribinogalactan and peptidoglycan in cell wall
	* low permeability of wall so antibiotic effectiveness reduced
	* Lipoarabinomannan in pathogen-host interaction
		* facilitates survival in macrophages.
* Genome
	* high Guanine-plus-Cytosine 65.6%
	* indiated aerobic "lifestlye"
	* large proportion of genes are devoted to the production of enzymes involved in cell wall metabolism
	* Genotyping methods
		* Insertion sequence 6110 (IS6110)
		* RFLP
		* Spogliotyping
		* MIRU-VTNRs - mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit variable num- ber tandem repeats

# Epidemiology
data do
## Resistance definitions
* RR-TB
	* resistant to rifampicin/ rifampin 
	* 3.3%
* MDR-TB
	* Isoniazid and rifampin 
	* 18%
* Pre-XDR TB
	* MDR-TB/ RR-TB + any Fluoroquinolone
* XDR-TB
	* MDR-TB / RR-TB + any fluoroquinolone + one additional Gp. A including Levofloxacin, Moxiflocacin, Bedaquiline & Linezolid
	* 6.2% of MDR-TB 
## Exposure to Infection 
* m/c transmitted from person with TB (pulmonary)
* droplet nuclei aerosolized by
	* coughing
	* sneezing
	* talking
* Usually dry quickly, 
	* but smallest (<5–10 μm in diameter) may remain suspended in the air for several hours 
	* may reach the terminal air passages when inhaled 
* 3000 droplet nuclei per cough
* Other routes Skin, placenta uncommon
* Risk depends on

| ENDOGENOUS | EXOGENOUS factors |
| ---- | ---- |
| less significant | more significant |
| Degree of immune competence | Probability of infectious contact |
| more in HIV, cancer treatment, immunosuppresants | Intimacy and duration of contact |
|  | degree of infectiveness |
|  | shared environment |
* High degree of infectiveness 
	*  AFB-microscope +
	* Cavitary lung disease 
	* laryngeal TB
	* AFB 10^5-10^7 AFB/ml
	* Crowding in poor ventilated rooms
* Low Degree of Infectiveness 
	* AFB negative
	* Culture negative
	* extra pulmonary 
	* HIV + TB as less cavitary lesions 
* Upto 20 contacts infected per AFB positive case before Dx or 3-10/years 

## Infection to disease 
* Risk of disease related to ENDOGENOUS factors 
	* Innate immunological and non-immunological defences
	* Cell mediated immunity 
* Illness directly after infection is PRIMARY TB
	* Children in first few years 
	* immunocompromised
	* Severe and disseminated 
	* not highly transmitted 
* infection later in life-- 
	* Body contains
	* Bacillus persists for years in body
	* reactivated to SECONDARY or POSTPRIMARY TB
		* Cavitations more
		* more infectious than PRIMARY 
		* 10% develop TB (half in first 18 months)
		* higher risk in immunocompromised 
		* Reinfection in previously infected also causes
			* more in area of high transmission
* Age is risk factor of disease 
	* highest in adolescent and early adults
		* WOmen>> men 
	* Elderly 
		* Men > WOmen 
		* waning immunity and comorbidities

## Natural history of disease 
* Untreated TB is fatal
* 1/3 die in 1 years 
* 55% in 5 and 86% in 10 years 
* Treatment cures
* improper treatment increases chronic disease and drug resistant

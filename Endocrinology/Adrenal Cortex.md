- classes of corticosteroid hormones: 
	- glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol), 
	- mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone)
	- adrenal androgen precursors (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
# Anatomy and Development 
- weight 6-11g 
- supply 
	- initially to the subcapsular region 
	- meanders from the outer cortical zona glomerulosa through the intermediate zona fasciculata to the inner zona reticularis and 
	- eventually to the adrenal medulla
- right suprarenal vein drains directly into the vena cava, while the left suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein 
- originate from the ***urogenital ridge*** and then separate from gonads and kidneys at ***about the sixth week of gestation***
- time of sexual differentiation ***(seventh to ninth week of gestation, starts to produce cortisol and the adrenal sex steroid precursor DHEA***
- orphan nuclear receptors ***SF1*** (ste- roidogenic factor 1; encoded by the gene NR5A1) and ***DAX1*** (dosage-sensitive sex reversal gene 1; encoded by the gene NR0B1) critical during development 
# Regulator control of steroidogenesis 
## Glucocorticoid 
- by HPA axis
- under inhibitory feedback control by HP 
- ![[adrenalHPA.png]]
- Hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates 
- 241–amino acid polypeptide ***proopiomelanocortin (POMC)*** by pituitary-specific prohormone convertase 1 (***PC1***), yielding the ***39–amino acid peptide ACTH***
- ACTH 
	- released by the corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary 
	- regulator of adrenal cortisol synthesis 
	- additional short-term effects on mineralocorticoid and adrenal androgen synthesis 
	- CRH and ACTH release in a pulsatile fashion that follows a circadian rhythm under the control of the hypothalamus, specifically its ***suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)*** 
	- rise in the early morning hours prior to awakening, with peak levels in the morning and low levels in the evening

- Diagnosis based on negative feedback 
	- ***dexamethasone suppression test
		- Glucocorticoid excess is diagnosed by employing a ***dexamethasone suppression test.*** Dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, suppresses CRH/ACTH by binding hypothalamic-pituitary glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and, therefore, results in downregulation of endogenous cortisol synthesis 
		- in autonomic cortisol (adrenal nodule) then little effect as ACTH already suppressed 
		- if ACTH driven excess, low dose dexa little effects but high dose suppress 
		- ectopic ACTH tumours resistant to dexamethasone suppression 
		- establish the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome and assist with the differential diagnosis of cortisol excess.
	- ***ACTH stimulation Test*** 
		- assess glucocorticoid deficiency 
		- first 24  ACTH peptides are sufficient to elicit a physiologic response
		- administration of cosyntropin (ACTH 1-24), 0.25 mg IM or IV, and collection of blood samples at 0, 30, and 60 min for cortisol 
		- normal response is defined as a cortisol level >15–20 μg/dL (>400–550 nmol/L) 30–60 min after cosyntropin stimulation 
	- ***Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT)***
		- injection of insulin to induce hypoglycemia, which represents a strong stress signal 
		- administration of regular insulin 0.1 U/kg IV (dose should be lower if hypopituitarism is likely) and 
		- collection of blood samples at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min for glucose, cortisol, and growth hormone (GH), if also assessing the GH axis
		- Oral or IV glucose is administered after the patient has achieved symptomatic hypoglycemia (usually plasma glucose <40 mg/dL) 
		- normal response is defined as a cortisol >20 μg/dL and GH >5.1 μg/L 
		- contraindicated in patients with coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, or seizure disorders
## Mineralocorticoid by RAAS 
- initiated by the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney, resulting in cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I in the liver
- ACE) cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which binds and acti- vates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) 
- increased adrenal aldosterone production and vasoconstriction.

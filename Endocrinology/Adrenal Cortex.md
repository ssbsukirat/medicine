- classes of corticosteroid hormones: 
	- glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol), 
	- mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone)
	- adrenal androgen precursors (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
# Anatomy and Development 
- weight 6-11g 
- supply 
	- initially to the subcapsular region 
	- meanders from the outer cortical zona glomerulosa through the intermediate zona fasciculata to the inner zona reticularis and 
	- eventually to the adrenal medulla
- right suprarenal vein drains directly into the vena cava, while the left suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein 
- originate from the ***urogenital ridge*** and then separate from gonads and kidneys at ***about the sixth week of gestation***
- time of sexual differentiation ***(seventh to ninth week of gestation, starts to produce cortisol and the adrenal sex steroid precursor DHEA***
- orphan nuclear receptors ***SF1*** (ste- roidogenic factor 1; encoded by the gene NR5A1) and ***DAX1*** (dosage-sensitive sex reversal gene 1; encoded by the gene NR0B1) critical during development 
# Regulator control of steroidogenesis 
## Glucocorticoid 
- by HPA axis
- under inhibitory feedback control by HP 
- ![[adrenalHPA.png]]
- Hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates 
- 241–amino acid polypeptide ***proopiomelanocortin (POMC)*** by pituitary-specific prohormone convertase 1 (***PC1***), yielding the ***39–amino acid peptide ACTH***
- ACTH 
	- released by the corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary 
	- regulator of adrenal cortisol synthesis 
	- additional short-term effects on mineralocorticoid and adrenal androgen synthesis 
	- CRH and ACTH release in a pulsatile fashion that follows a circadian rhythm under the control of the hypothalamus, specifically its ***suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)*** 
	- rise in the early morning hours prior to awakening, with peak levels in the morning and low levels in the evening 
	- ![[circadianadrenal.png]]
- Diagnosis based on negative feedback 
	- ***dexamethasone suppression test
		- Glucocorticoid excess is diagnosed by employing a ***dexamethasone suppression test.*** Dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, suppresses CRH/ACTH by binding hypothalamic-pituitary glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and, therefore, results in downregulation of endogenous cortisol synthesis 
		- in autonomic cortisol (adrenal nodule) then little effect as ACTH already suppressed 
		- if ACTH driven excess, low dose dexa little effects but high dose suppress 
		- ectopic ACTH tumours resistant to dexamethasone suppression 
		- establish the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome and assist with the differential diagnosis of cortisol excess.
	- ***ACTH stimulation Test*** 
		- assess glucocorticoid deficiency 
		- first 24  ACTH peptides are sufficient to elicit a physiologic response
		- administration of cosyntropin (ACTH 1-24), 0.25 mg IM or IV, and collection of blood samples at 0, 30, and 60 min for cortisol 
		- normal response is defined as a cortisol level >15–20 μg/dL (>400–550 nmol/L) 30–60 min after cosyntropin stimulation 
	- ***Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT)***
		- injection of insulin to induce hypoglycemia, which represents a strong stress signal 
		- administration of regular insulin 0.1 U/kg IV (dose should be lower if hypopituitarism is likely) and 
		- collection of blood samples at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min for glucose, cortisol, and growth hormone (GH), if also assessing the GH axis
		- Oral or IV glucose is administered after the patient has achieved symptomatic hypoglycemia (usually plasma glucose <40 mg/dL) 
		- normal response is defined as a cortisol >20 μg/dL and GH >5.1 μg/L 
		- contraindicated in patients with coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, or seizure disorders
## Mineralocorticoid by RAAS 
- ![[AdrenalRAAS.png]]
- initiated by the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney, resulting in cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I in the liver
- ACE) cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which binds and acti- vates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) 
- increased adrenal aldosterone production and vasoconstriction 
- Aldosterone enhances sodium retention and potassium excretion and increases the arterial perfusion pressure, which in turn regulates renin release 
- hypothalamic-pituitary damage does not significantly impact the capacity of the adrenal to synthesize aldosterone 
# STEROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS, METABOLISM, AND ACTION 
- ACTH needed to initiate steroidogenesis 
- MC2R (melanocortin 2 receptor ACTH receptor) interaction with MRAP (MC2R accessory protein) and complex moved to adrenocortical cell membrane and binding to ACTH 
- ACTH generate cAMP --> upregulate  Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway 
- inactive PKA (tetramer of 2 regulator + 2 catalytic units) --> cAMP --> dimer (2 regulator + cAMP) + 2 active catalysts
- PKA activation 
	- increases the import of cholesterol esters 
	- increases the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase 
		- cleaves cholesterol esters to cholesterol for import into the mitochondrion
	- increases the availability and phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP response element binding), 
		- a transcription factor that enhances transcription of CYP11A1 and other enzymes required for glucocorticoid synthesis 
- steroidogenesis occurs in a zone-specific fashion, 
	- ***mineralocorticoid*** synthesis occurring in the ***outer zona glomerulosa,*** 
	- ***glucocorticoid*** synthesis in the ***zona fasciculata, and adrenal*** 
	- ***androgen*** biosynthesis in the ***inner*** zona ***reticularis*** serving as precursors for both classic and 11-oxygenated androgens
- pathways require cholesterol import into the mitochondrion, by ***steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein***, which shuttles cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane
- majority of steroidogenic enzymes are cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are either located in the 
	- mitochondrion (side chain cleavage enzyme, CYP11A1; 11β- hydroxylase, CYP11B1; aldosterone synthase, CYP11B2)
	- endoplasmic reticulum membrane (17α-hydroxylase, CYP17A1; 21-hydroxylase, CYP21A2; aromatase, CYP19A1)
- ![[adrenalpathways.png]]
-  In circulation mainly bound to CBG (cortisol binding globulin), some to albumin and small fraction free 
- Free cortisol enters cell directly and in peripheral tissue like adipose, liver, muscle, brain cortisone converted to cortisol by 11B-HSD1 
- binds and activate Glucocorticoid Receptor in cytosol, leads to dissociation of HSPs(heat shock proteins) and dimerization
- GR dimers translocate in the nucleus and activate Glucocorticoid Response elements (GREs) causing GR transactivation 
- May form heterodimer with AP-1 or NF-KB leading to repression of inflammatory genes leading to anti-inflammatory effects
- Cortisol to cortisone (inactive) by 11B-HSD2 in kidney, colon, salivary gland and others 
- Cortisol and aldosterone have equal affinity for mineralocorticoid receptor but cortisol has 1000 times concentration in blood so inactivation by 11B-HSD2 is a modulator

	- 90% by corticotrope pituitary microadenoma 
	- Macroadenoma in 5-10% 
	- mostly sporadic but rarely with MEN1
	- mutations in the deubiquitinase USP8, which leads to constitutive activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and increase POMC (ACTH precursor)-- more in adults and women 
- Ectopic ACTH 
	- occult carcinoid tumors, most frequently in the lung, but also in thymus or pancreas 
	- advanced small cell CA kung 
	- rarely MTC or pheochromocytoma 
- ACTH-independent 
	- adrenal adenoma 
	- PKA catalytic subunit PRKACA in 40% 
- PBMAH 
	- PRIMARY Bilateral Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia 
	- low circulating ACTH 
	- ***Intraadrenal*** ACTH production 
	- ectopic expression of G-PCRs not usually found in the adrenal, including receptors for ***LH, vasopressin, serotonin, IL-1, catecholamines, or GIP the cause of food-dependent Cushing’s.***
	- mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene ***ARMC5*** have been identified
	- present with biochemical evidence of Cushing’s but lack specific clinical signs, which develop slowly over decades and accelerate cardiovascular risk 
- PPNAD 
	- primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease 
	- Germline mutations in one of the regulatory subunits of PKA, PRKAR1A 
	- part of ***Carney***’s complex, an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia condition associated with ***cardiac myxomas, hyperlentiginosis, Sertoli cell tumors, and PPNAD*** 
- McCune-Albright Syndrome 
	- rare cause of ACTH-independent 
	- polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, unilateral café-au-lait spots, and precocious puberty
	- activating mutations in the stimulatory G pro- tein alpha subunit 1, GNAS-1 (guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha stimulating activity polypeptide 1)

- classes of corticosteroid hormones: 
	- glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol), 
	- mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone)
	- adrenal androgen precursors (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
# Anatomy and Development 
- weight 6-11g 
- supply 
	- initially to the subcapsular region 
	- meanders from the outer cortical zona glomerulosa through the intermediate zona fasciculata to the inner zona reticularis and 
	- eventually to the adrenal medulla
- right suprarenal vein drains directly into the vena cava, while the left suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein 
- originate from the ***urogenital ridge*** and then separate from gonads and kidneys at ***about the sixth week of gestation***
- time of sexual differentiation ***(seventh to ninth week of gestation, starts to produce cortisol and the adrenal sex steroid precursor DHEA***
- orphan nuclear receptors ***SF1*** (ste- roidogenic factor 1; encoded by the gene NR5A1) and ***DAX1*** (dosage-sensitive sex reversal gene 1; encoded by the gene NR0B1) critical during development 
# Regulator control of steroidogenesis 
## Glucocorticoid 
- by HPA axis
- under inhibitory feedback control by HP 
- ![[adrenalHPA.png]]
- Hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates 
- 241–amino acid polypeptide ***proopiomelanocortin (POMC)*** by pituitary-specific prohormone convertase 1 (***PC1***), yielding the ***39–amino acid peptide ACTH***
- ACTH 
	- released by the corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary 
	- regulator of adrenal cortisol synthesis 
	- additional short-term effects on mineralocorticoid and adrenal androgen synthesis 
	- CRH and ACTH release in a pulsatile fashion that follows a circadian rhythm under the control of the hypothalamus, specifically its ***suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)*** 
	- rise in the early morning hours prior to awakening, with peak levels in the morning and low levels in the evening

- Diagnosis based on negative feedback 
	- Glucocorticoid excess is diagnosed by employing a ***dexamethasone suppression test.*** Dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, suppresses CRH/ACTH by binding hypothalamic-pituitary glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and, therefore, results in downregulation of endogenous cortisol synthesis

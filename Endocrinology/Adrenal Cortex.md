- classes of corticosteroid hormones: 
	- glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol), 
	- mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone)
	- adrenal androgen precursors (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
# Anatomy and Development 
- weight 6-11g 
- supply 
	- initially to the subcapsular region 
	- meanders from the outer cortical zona glomerulosa through the intermediate zona fasciculata to the inner zona reticularis and 
	- eventually to the adrenal medulla
- right suprarenal vein drains directly into the vena cava, while the left suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein 
- originate from the ***urogenital ridge*** and then separate from gonads and kidneys at ***about the sixth week of gestation***
- time of sexual differentiation ***(seventh to ninth week of gestation, starts to produce cortisol and the adrenal sex steroid precursor DHEA***
- orphan nuclear receptors ***SF1*** (ste- roidogenic factor 1; encoded by the gene NR5A1) and ***DAX1*** (dosage-sensitive sex reversal gene 1; encoded by the gene NR0B1) critical during development 
# Regulator control of steroidogenesis 
## Glucocorticoid 
- by HPA axis
- under inhibitory feedback control by HP 
- ![[adrenalHPA.png]]
- Hypothalamic release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulates 
- 241–amino acid polypeptide ***proopiomelanocortin (POMC)*** by pituitary-specific prohormone convertase 1 (***PC1***), yielding the ***39–amino acid peptide ACTH***
- ACTH 
	- released by the corticotrope cells of the anterior pituitary 
	- regulator of adrenal cortisol synthesis 
	- additional short-term effects on mineralocorticoid and adrenal androgen synthesis 
	- CRH and ACTH release in a pulsatile fashion that follows a circadian rhythm under the control of the hypothalamus, specifically its ***suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)*** 
	- rise in the early morning hours prior to awakening, with peak levels in the morning and low levels in the evening 
	- ![[circadianadrenal.png]]
- Diagnosis based on negative feedback 
	- ***dexamethasone suppression test
		- Glucocorticoid excess is diagnosed by employing a ***dexamethasone suppression test.*** Dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, suppresses CRH/ACTH by binding hypothalamic-pituitary glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and, therefore, results in downregulation of endogenous cortisol synthesis 
		- in autonomic cortisol (adrenal nodule) then little effect as ACTH already suppressed 
		- if ACTH driven excess, low dose dexa little effects but high dose suppress 
		- ectopic ACTH tumours resistant to dexamethasone suppression 
		- establish the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome and assist with the differential diagnosis of cortisol excess.
	- ***ACTH stimulation Test*** 
		- assess glucocorticoid deficiency 
		- first 24  ACTH peptides are sufficient to elicit a physiologic response
		- administration of cosyntropin (ACTH 1-24), 0.25 mg IM or IV, and collection of blood samples at 0, 30, and 60 min for cortisol 
		- normal response is defined as a cortisol level >15–20 μg/dL (>400–550 nmol/L) 30–60 min after cosyntropin stimulation 
	- ***Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT)***
		- injection of insulin to induce hypoglycemia, which represents a strong stress signal 
		- administration of regular insulin 0.1 U/kg IV (dose should be lower if hypopituitarism is likely) and 
		- collection of blood samples at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min for glucose, cortisol, and growth hormone (GH), if also assessing the GH axis
		- Oral or IV glucose is administered after the patient has achieved symptomatic hypoglycemia (usually plasma glucose <40 mg/dL) 
		- normal response is defined as a cortisol >20 μg/dL and GH >5.1 μg/L 
		- contraindicated in patients with coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, or seizure disorders
## Mineralocorticoid by RAAS 
- ![[AdrenalRAAS.png]]
- initiated by the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney, resulting in cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I in the liver
- ACE) cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which binds and acti- vates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) 
- increased adrenal aldosterone production and vasoconstriction 
- Aldosterone enhances sodium retention and potassium excretion and increases the arterial perfusion pressure, which in turn regulates renin release 
- hypothalamic-pituitary damage does not significantly impact the capacity of the adrenal to synthesize aldosterone 
# STEROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS, METABOLISM, AND ACTION 
- ACTH needed to initiate steroidogenesis 
- MC2R (melanocortin 2 receptor ACTH receptor) interaction with MRAP (MC2R accessory protein) and complex moved to adrenocortical cell membrane and binding to ACTH 
- ACTH generate cAMP --> upregulate  Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway 
- inactive PKA (tetramer of 2 regulator + 2 catalytic units) --> cAMP --> dimer (2 regulator + cAMP) + 2 active catalysts
- PKA activation 
	- increases the import of cholesterol esters 
	- increases the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase 
		- cleaves cholesterol esters to cholesterol for import into the mitochondrion
	- increases the availability and phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP response element binding), 
		- a transcription factor that enhances transcription of CYP11A1 and other enzymes required for glucocorticoid synthesis 
- steroidogenesis occurs in a zone-specific fashion, 
	- ***mineralocorticoid*** synthesis occurring in the ***outer zona glomerulosa,*** 
	- ***glucocorticoid*** synthesis in the ***zona fasciculata, and adrenal*** 
	- ***androgen*** biosynthesis in the ***inner*** zona ***reticularis*** serving as precursors for both classic and 11-oxygenated androgens
- pathways require cholesterol import into the mitochondrion, by ***steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein***, which shuttles cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane
- majority of steroidogenic enzymes are cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are either located in the 
	- mitochondrion (side chain cleavage enzyme, CYP11A1; 11β- hydroxylase, CYP11B1; aldosterone synthase, CYP11B2)
	- endoplasmic reticulum membrane (17α-hydroxylase, CYP17A1; 21-hydroxylase, CYP21A2; aromatase, CYP19A1)
- ![[adrenalpathways.png]]
-  In circulation mainly bound to CBG (cortisol binding globulin), some to albumin and small fraction free 
- Free cortisol enters cell directly and in peripheral tissue like adipose, liver, muscle, brain cortisone converted to cortisol by 11B-HSD1 
- binds and activate Glucocorticoid Receptor in cytosol, leads to dissociation of HSPs(heat shock proteins) and dimerization
- GR dimers translocate in the nucleus and activate Glucocorticoid Response elements (GREs) causing GR transactivation 
- May form heterodimer with AP-1 or NF-KB leading to repression of inflammatory genes leading to anti-inflammatory effects
- Cortisol to cortisone (inactive) by 11B-HSD2 in kidney, colon, salivary gland and others 
- Cortisol and aldosterone have equal affinity for mineralocorticoid receptor but cortisol has 1000 times concentration in blood so inactivation by 11B-HSD2 is a modulator

# Cushing's
- Constellation of clinical features resulting from chronic exposure to excessive Glucocorticoids of any etiology
- ACTH-dependent 
    - pituitary corticotrope adenoma (Cushing's Disease)
    - ectopic secretion of ACTH
- ACTH-independent 
    - adrenocortical adenoma
    - Adrenocortical carcinoma
    - Nodular adrenal hyperplasia
    - Iatrogenic
## Epidemiology
- rare 
- 1-2/100000
- Mild cortisol excess in diabetics, obese and osteoporotic fracture
- Majority have ACTH producing adenoma in pituitary (Cushing's Disease) (if endogenous production)
    - women more 
    - Prepubertal more in boys 
- ectopic ACTH more in men
- Iatrogenic Cushing's most common
## Etiology
- Cushings disease
	- 90% by corticotrope pituitary microadenoma 
	- Macroadenoma in 5-10% 
	- mostly sporadic but rarely with MEN1
	- mutations in the deubiquitinase USP8, which leads to constitutive activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and increase POMC (ACTH precursor)-- more in adults and women 
- Ectopic ACTH 
	- occult carcinoid tumors, most frequently in the lung, but also in thymus or pancreas 
	- advanced small cell CA kung 
	- rarely MTC or pheochromocytoma 
- ACTH-independent 
	- adrenal adenoma 
	- PKA catalytic subunit PRKACA in 40% 
- PBMAH 
	- PRIMARY Bilateral Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia 
	- low circulating ACTH 
	- ***Intraadrenal*** ACTH production 
	- ectopic expression of G-PCRs not usually found in the adrenal, including receptors for ***LH, vasopressin, serotonin, IL-1, catecholamines, or GIP the cause of food-dependent Cushing’s.***
	- mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene ***ARMC5*** have been identified
	- present with biochemical evidence of Cushing’s but lack specific clinical signs, which develop slowly over decades and accelerate cardiovascular risk 
- PPNAD 
	- primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease 
	- Germline mutations in one of the regulatory subunits of PKA, PRKAR1A 
	- part of ***Carney***’s complex, an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia condition associated with ***cardiac myxomas, hyperlentiginosis, Sertoli cell tumors, and PPNAD*** 
- McCune-Albright Syndrome 
	- rare cause of ACTH-independent 
	- polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, unilateral café-au-lait spots, and precocious puberty
	- activating mutations in the stimulatory G pro- tein alpha subunit 1, GNAS-1 (guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha stimulating activity polypeptide 1) 
## Clinical 
- ![[cushingsfeatures.png]]
- upregulation of gluconeogenesis, lipolysis,and protein catabolism causing the most prominent features
- overcomes the ability of 11β-HSD2 to rapidly inactivate cortisol to cortisone in the kidney, thereby exerting mineralocorticoid actions, manifest as diastolic hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema
- interfere with central regulatory systems, leading to suppression of gonadotropins with subsequent hypogonadism and amenorrhea and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, resulting in decreased TSH secretion
- Clinical manifestations of Cushing’s do not differ substantially among the different causes of Cushing’s.
- In ***ectopic ACTH syndrome, hyperpigmentation*** of the knuckles, scars, or skin areas exposed to increased friction can be observed 
- ectopic ACTH syndrome, and some with ACC as the cause of Cushing’s, may have a more brisk onset and rapid progression of clinical signs and symptoms, namely of edema, hypokalemia, and hypertension 
- Hypercoagulable state so more DVT, and PTE 
- Psychiatric like anxiety or depression, acute paranoia or depressive psychosis may occur 
## Diagnosis 
- ![[cushingsdiagnosis.png]]
- protocol requires establishing the diagnosis of Cushing’s beyond doubt prior to employing any tests used for the differential diagnosis of the condition 
- after excluding exogenous glucocorticoid use as the cause of clinical signs and symptoms, 
- suspected cases should be tested if there are multiple and progressive features of Cushing’s, particularly ***features with a potentially higher discriminatory value***.
- Exclusion of Cushing’s is also indicated in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses
- Several tests done 
	- increased 24-h urinary free cortisol excretion in three separate collections,
	- failure to appropriately suppress morning cortisol after overnight exposure to dexamethasone, and 
	- evidence of loss of diurnal cortisol secretion with high levels at midnight, the time of the physiologically lowest secretion
	- exclude interfering factors such as incomplete 24-h urine collection or rapid inactiva- tion of dexamethasone due to concurrent intake of CYP3A4-inducing drugs (e.g., antiepileptics, rifampicin)
	- OCPs raise CBG and thus total cortisol can cause failure to suppress after dexamethasone 
	- testing should be repeated after 4–6 weeks off estrogens 
	- pseudo-Cushing states, i.e., alcohol-related, and those with cyclic Cushing’s may require further testing 
## Differential 
- begins with the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent cortisol excess 
- patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing’s have normal or increased plasma ACTH, 
- very high levels being found in some patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome 
- imaging should only be used after it is established whether the cortisol excess is ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent because nodules in the pituitary or the adrenal are a common finding in the general population
- confirmed ACTH-independent excess, adrenal imaging is indicated --> preferred NCCT scan 
	- allows assessment of adrenal morphology and determination of precontrast tumor density in Hounsfield units (HUs)
- ACTH-dependent cortisol excess 
	- MRI of the pituitary is the investigation of choice (maybe normal in 40%)
	- corticotrope adenomas fail to enhance following gadolinium administration on T1-weighted MRI images 
	- pituitary Cushing’s disease and ectopic ACTH syndrome by extra tests
	- most pituitary corticotrope adenomas still display regulatory features, including residual ACTH suppression by high-dose glucocorticoids and CRH responsiveness 
	- ectopic sources of ACTH are typically resistant to dexametha- sone suppression and unresponsive to CRH 
	- two tests show discordant results or if there is any other reason for doubt, the differential diagnosis can be further clarified by performing bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) with concurrent blood sampling for ACTH in the right and left inferior petrosal sinus and a peripheral vein
	- ncreased central/peripheral plasma ACTH ratio >2 at baseline and >3 at 2–5 min after CRH injection is indicative of Cushing’s disease 
	- the results of the IPSS cannot be reliably used for lateralization 
-  differential diagnostic testing indicates ectopic ACTH syndrome, 
	- then further imaging should include high-resolution, fine-cut CT scanning of the chest and abdomen for scrutiny of the lung, thymus, and pancreas 
	- If no lesions are identified, an MRI of the chest can be considered because carcinoid tumors usually show high signal intensity on T2-weighted images
	- octreotide scintigraphy can be helpful in some cases because ectopic ACTH-producing tumors often express somatostatin receptor 
## Treatment 
- ACTH-independent 
	- surgical removal of adrenal tumour 
	- Smaller have minimally invasive 
	- large open approach 
- Cushings Disease 
	- selective removal of the pituitary corticotrope tumor, usually via an endoscopic trans- sphenoidal approach 
	- long-term follow-up is important because late relapse occurs in a significant number of patients 
	- recurs, there are several options, including second surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and bilateral adrenalectomy 
- very severe, overt Cushing’s (e.g., difficult to control hypokalemic hypertension or acute psychosis), it may be necessary to introduce ***medical*** therapy to rapidly control the cortisol excess during the period leading up to surgery, which also can help to alleviate hypercoagulability and, thus, operative risk

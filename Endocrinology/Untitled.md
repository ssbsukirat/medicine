Here are notes from the provided chapter, structured as requested:

### Disorders of the Adrenal Cortex - General Information

- The adrenal cortex produces three classes of corticosteroid hormones: **glucocorticoids** (e.g., cortisol), **mineralocorticoids** (e.g., aldosterone), and **adrenal androgen precursors** (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]).
- Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids act through specific nuclear receptors, regulating the **physiologic stress response**, **blood pressure**, and **electrolyte homeostasis**.
- Adrenal androgen precursors are converted in the gonads and peripheral target cells to sex steroids.
- Disorders are characterized by **deficiency or excess** of one or more of these major corticosteroid classes.
- **Hormone deficiency** can be caused by inherited glandular or enzymatic disorders, or destruction of the pituitary or adrenal gland by autoimmune disorders, infection, infarction, or iatrogenic events (e.g., surgery, hormonal suppression).
- **Hormone excess** is usually due to **neoplasia**, leading to increased production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary or neuroendocrine ectopic ACTH-producing cells, or increased production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, or adrenal androgen precursors by adrenal nodules.
- Adrenal nodules are increasingly identified incidentally during cross-sectional imaging.

### Adrenal Anatomy and Development

- Normal adrenal glands weigh **6–11 g each** and are located **above the kidneys**.
- They have their own blood supply; arterial blood flows from the subcapsular region through the outer cortical **zona glomerulosa**, the intermediate **zona fasciculata**, the inner **zona reticularis**, and eventually to the adrenal medulla.
- The right suprarenal vein drains directly into the vena cava, while the left suprarenal vein drains into the left renal vein.
- **Embryonic Development**:
    - Adrenals originate from the **urogenital ridge** and separate from gonads and kidneys around the **sixth week of gestation**.
    - The adrenal cortex begins to produce **cortisol** and the adrenal sex steroid precursor **DHEA** around the seventh to ninth week of gestation, concurrent with sexual differentiation.
    - **SF1** (steroidogenic factor 1; encoded by _NR5A1_) and **DAX1** (dosage-sensitive sex reversal gene 1; encoded by _NR0B1_) are crucial orphan nuclear receptors regulating adrenal genes involved in steroidogenesis during this period.

### Regulatory Control of Steroidogenesis

- Production of **glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens** is controlled by the **hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis**.
- **Mineralocorticoids** are regulated by the **renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system**.

#### Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis

- **Glucocorticoid synthesis** is under **inhibitory feedback control** by the hypothalamus and pituitary.
- **Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)** is released from the hypothalamus in response to stress.
- CRH stimulates the pituitary to cleave proopiomelanocortin (POMC) by prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), yielding **ACTH**.
- ACTH acts as the **pivotal regulator of adrenal cortisol synthesis**, with additional short-term effects on mineralocorticoid and adrenal androgen synthesis.
- CRH and ACTH release is **pulsatile** and follows a **circadian rhythm**, controlled by the hypothalamus (specifically the suprachiasmatic nucleus) and cell-specific clock genes.
- Adrenal cortisol secretion exhibits a distinct circadian rhythm, rising in the early morning, peaking around **8:30 A.M.**, and having low levels in the evening (nadir around midnight).

#### Diagnostic Tests of the HPA Axis

- Tests utilize the negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis.
- **Glucocorticoid Excess**:
    - **Dexamethasone suppression test** is used. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, suppresses CRH/ACTH by binding to hypothalamic-pituitary glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), downregulating endogenous cortisol synthesis.
    - If cortisol production is **autonomous** (e.g., adrenal nodule), ACTH is already suppressed, and dexamethasone has little additional effect.
    - If cortisol production is driven by an **ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma**, low-dose dexamethasone is ineffective, but high doses usually induce suppression.
    - If cortisol production is driven by an **ectopic source of ACTH**, the tumors are usually resistant to dexamethasone suppression.
    - This test helps diagnose Cushing’s syndrome and differentiate causes of cortisol excess.
- **Glucocorticoid Deficiency**:
    - **ACTH stimulation of cortisol production** is used.
    - **Standard ACTH stimulation test**: involves administering 0.25 mg cosyntropin (ACTH 1-24) IM or IV, and collecting blood samples at 0, 30, and 60 minutes for cortisol. A normal response is defined as a cortisol level **>15–20 μg/dL** (>400–550 nmol/L) at 30–60 minutes post-stimulation.
    - A low-dose (1 μg) version exists but offers no superior diagnostic value.
    - **Insulin tolerance test (ITT)**: involves injecting insulin to induce hypoglycemia, a strong stress signal triggering CRH release and HPA axis activation. Samples are collected for glucose, cortisol, and growth hormone (GH) at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. A normal response is cortisol >20 μg/dL and GH >5.1 μg/L.
    - The ITT requires careful monitoring and is **contraindicated** in patients with coronary disease, cerebrovascular disease, or seizure disorders.
    - The **short cosyntropin test** is the commonly accepted first-line test due to ITT contraindications.

#### Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone (RAA) System

- Mineralocorticoid production is controlled by the RAA cycle.
- It starts with **renin release** from juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney, which cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I in the liver.
- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves angiotensin I to **angiotensin II**, which binds and activates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), leading to increased adrenal aldosterone production and vasoconstriction.
- Aldosterone enhances sodium retention, potassium excretion, and increases arterial perfusion pressure, which in turn regulates renin release.
- **Hypothalamic-pituitary damage** does not significantly impact adrenal aldosterone synthesis because it's primarily controlled by the RAA system.

#### Diagnostic Tests of the RAA System

- **Mineralocorticoid excess** causes counter-regulatory downregulation of plasma renin.
- **Mineralocorticoid deficiency** causes markedly increased plasma renin.
- **Physiologically**, oral or IV sodium loading suppresses aldosterone; this response is attenuated or absent in patients with autonomous mineralocorticoid excess.

### Steroid Hormone Synthesis, Metabolism, and Action

- **ACTH stimulation** is required for the initiation of steroidogenesis.
- The ACTH receptor **MC2R** interacts with the **MC2R-accessory protein (MRAP)**, forming a complex transported to the adrenocortical cell membrane, where it binds ACTH.
- ACTH stimulation generates **cyclic AMP (cAMP)**, which upregulates the **protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway**.
- **PKA activation** affects steroidogenesis by:
    1. Increasing the import of **cholesterol esters**.
    2. Increasing the activity of **hormone-sensitive lipase** (cleaves cholesterol esters to cholesterol for mitochondrial import).
    3. Increasing the availability and phosphorylation of **CREB** (cAMP response element binding), a transcription factor that enhances transcription of CYP11A1 and other enzymes needed for glucocorticoid synthesis.
- **Adrenal steroidogenesis** occurs in a zone-specific fashion:
    - **Mineralocorticoid synthesis** in the outer **zona glomerulosa**.
    - **Glucocorticoid synthesis** in the **zona fasciculata**.
    - **Adrenal androgen biosynthesis** in the inner **zona reticularis**.
- All steroidogenic pathways require **cholesterol import into the mitochondrion**, initiated by the **steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein**.
- Most steroidogenic enzymes are **cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes**:
    - **Mitochondrial**: CYP11A1 (side chain cleavage enzyme), CYP11B1 (11β-hydroxylase), CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase).
    - **Endoplasmic reticulum membrane**: CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase), CYP21A2 (21-hydroxylase), CYP19A1 (aromatase).
    - These enzymes require electron donation via specific redox cofactor enzymes: **P450 oxidoreductase (POR)**for microsomal CYPs, and **adrenodoxin/adrenodoxin reductase (ADX/ADR)** for mitochondrial CYPs.
- The short-chain dehydrogenase **3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (3β-HSD2)** also plays a major role.

#### Specific Steroid Synthesis Steps

- **CYP11A1** generates **pregnenolone**.
- **Glucocorticoid (Cortisol) Synthesis**: Pregnenolone is converted to progesterone by 3β-HSD2, then to 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) by CYP17A1, followed by 21-hydroxylation by CYP21A2, and finally 11β-hydroxylation by CYP11B1 to generate **active cortisol**.
- **Mineralocorticoid (Aldosterone) Synthesis**: Progesterone is converted to deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by CYP21A2, then converted via corticosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone to **aldosterone** in three steps catalyzed by CYP11B2.
- **Adrenal Androgen Synthesis**: Pregnenolone undergoes conversion by **CYP17A1** (which uniquely catalyzes two reactions): its 17α-hydroxylase activity converts pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone, followed by generation of **DHEA** (universal sex steroid precursor) via CYP17A1 17,20 lyase activity.
    - Most DHEA is secreted as its sulfate ester, **DHEAS**, generated by DHEA sulfotransferase (SULT2A1).
    - DHEA is converted to androstenedione, which can be activated to testosterone or channeled into the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway by 11β-hydroxylation (CYP11B1).

#### Cortisol Metabolism and Receptor Action

- Cortisol circulates mainly bound to **cortisol-binding globulin (CBG)** and albumin, with a minor fraction as free, unbound hormone.
- **Free cortisol** is thought to enter cells directly.
- In peripheral target tissues, **cortisol is generated from inactive cortisone** within the cell by the enzyme **11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1)**.
    - 11β-HSD1 functions as a **tissue-specific prereceptor regulator of glucocorticoid action**.
    - It requires **NADPH**, provided by **hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH)**.
- In the cytosol of target cells, cortisol binds and activates the **glucocorticoid receptor (GR)**, causing dissociation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and subsequent dimerization.
    - Cortisol-bound GR dimers translocate to the nucleus and activate **glucocorticoid response elements (GREs)**, enhancing transcription of glucocorticoid-regulated genes (**GR transactivation**).
    - Cortisol-bound GR can also form heterodimers with transcription factors (e.g., AP-1, NF-κB), leading to **transrepression of proinflammatory genes**, which is crucial for glucocorticoids' anti-inflammatory action.
- **Corticosterone** also exerts glucocorticoid activity, though weaker than cortisol. In patients with 17-hydroxylase deficiency, corticosterone accumulates and can compensate for cortisol deficiency.
- Cortisol is inactivated to cortisone by the microsomal enzyme **11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2)**, primarily in the kidney, colon, and salivary glands.
    - Cortisol and aldosterone bind the **mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)** with equal affinity, but cortisol circulates at a much higher concentration (~1000-fold).
    - **11β-HSD2's rapid inactivation of cortisol to cortisone prevents MR activation by excess cortisol**, acting as a tissue-specific modulator of the MR pathway.
- **DOC** (deoxycorticosterone) also exerts mineralocorticoid activity; its accumulation can lead to mineralocorticoid excess.
- **Aldosterone synthesis** in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells is driven by **aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2)**.
    - Angiotensin II binding to the AT1 receptor causes glomerulosa cell membrane depolarization, increasing intracellular sodium (by inhibiting Na+/K+ ATPase and potassium channels). This increases intracellular calcium (by opening voltage-dependent calcium channels or inhibiting Ca2+ ATPase).
    - This triggers the calcium signaling pathway, upregulating CYP11B2 transcription.
- Aldosterone (or cortisol) binding to the **MR** in kidney tubule cells dissociates the HSP-receptor complex, allowing MR homodimerization and nuclear translocation.
    - Activated MR enhances transcription of the **epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)** and **serum glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK-1)**.
    - SGK-1 phosphorylates Nedd4, reducing its interaction with ENaC, thereby enhancing **ENaC trafficking to the cell surface** where it mediates sodium retention.

### Cushing’s Syndrome

- Cushing’s syndrome is a constellation of clinical features resulting from **chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids of any etiology**.
- **Cushing’s disease** specifically refers to Cushing’s syndrome caused by a **pituitary corticotrope adenoma**.

#### Epidemiology

- Generally rare, with an incidence of **1–2 per 100,000 population per year**.
- Mild cortisol excess may be more prevalent among patients with nonspecific features like centripetal obesity, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporotic vertebral fractures.
- The overwhelming majority of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome cases are caused by an **ACTH-producing corticotrope adenoma of the pituitary** (Cushing's disease).
- Cushing’s disease affects **women more frequently** (except in prepubertal cases, where it's more common in boys).
- Ectopic ACTH syndrome is more frequently identified in men.
- Only **10% of patients have a primary adrenal cause** (e.g., autonomous cortisol excess independent of ACTH), mostly women.
- The **most common cause overall is iatrogenic Cushing’s**, due to medical use of exogenous glucocorticoids.

#### Etiology

- **ACTH-dependent Cushing’s Syndrome**:
    - **Cushing’s Disease**:
        - In at least 90% of cases, ACTH excess is due to a **corticotrope pituitary microadenoma** (often a few millimeters). Pituitary macroadenomas (>1 cm) are found in 5–10% of patients.
        - Usually sporadic, but rarely associated with **multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1)**.
        - Frequently harbor **mutations in the deubiquitinase USP8**, leading to constitutive activation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling and upregulated POMC expression. USP8 mutations are more common in adults (41% vs 17% in children) and women (43% vs 17% in men).
    - **Ectopic ACTH Production**:
        - Predominantly caused by **occult carcinoid tumors**, most frequently in the lung, but also thymus or pancreas; often difficult to locate due to small size.
        - Advanced small-cell lung cancer can cause ectopic ACTH production.
        - Rarely originates from medullary thyroid carcinoma or pheochromocytoma (the latter co-secretes catecholamines and ACTH).
- **ACTH-independent Cushing’s Syndrome (Primary Adrenal Cause)**:
    - Majority of patients have a **cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma**; **somatic mutations in the PKA catalytic subunit PRKACA** are identified in 40% of these tumors.
    - **Adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs)** can also cause ACTH-independent disease; they are often large and produce excess of several corticosteroid classes.
    - **Primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PBMAH)** is a rare cause, characterized by low circulating ACTH but evidence of **autocrine stimulation via intraadrenal ACTH production**.
        - These nodules often exhibit **ectopic expression of G protein-coupled receptors** not usually found in the adrenal (e.g., for luteinizing hormone, vasopressin, serotonin, interleukin 1, catecholamines, or gastric inhibitory peptide [GIP]), leading to **food-dependent Cushing’s**.
        - Activation of these receptors upregulates PKA signaling, increasing cortisol production.
        - A combination of **germline and somatic mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene ARMC5** is a prevalent cause; patients often show biochemical evidence of Cushing’s but clinical signs develop slowly over decades.
        - Constitutively activating mutations in **PRKACA** are somatic mutations in one-third of cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas, and germline mutations can cause macronodular adrenal hyperplasia with cortisol excess.
    - **Primary pigmented nodular adrenal disease (PPNAD)** is a rare cause, part of **Carney’s complex** (an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia condition).
        - It is caused by **germline mutations in one of the regulatory subunits of PKA, PRKAR1A**.
        - Associated with cardiac myxomas, hyperlentiginosis, and Sertoli cell tumors.
        - PPNAD can present as micronodular or macronodular hyperplasia.
        - Mutations in **PDE11A and PDE8B** (phosphodiesterases) have been identified in patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing’s, with or without PPNAD.
    - **McCune-Albright syndrome** is another rare cause, associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, unilateral café-au-lait spots, and precocious puberty.
        - It is caused by **activating mutations in the stimulatory G protein alpha subunit 1, GNAS-1**. Such mutations have also been found in bilateral macronodular hyperplasia without other McCune-Albright features and, rarely, in isolated cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas.

#### Clinical Manifestations

- Excess glucocorticoids affect almost all body cells, leading to signs impacting multiple physiologic systems, with **upregulation of gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and protein catabolism** causing the most prominent features.
- Excess glucocorticoid secretion overwhelms the ability of 11β-HSD2 to inactivate cortisol to cortisone, leading to mineralocorticoid actions like **diastolic hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema**.
- Glucocorticoid excess also interferes with central regulatory systems, suppressing gonadotropins (causing hypogonadism and amenorrhea) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (decreasing TSH).
- Many clinical signs are nonspecific, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hirsutism, and depression.
- Diagnosis should be considered when several features are present, particularly if more specific or at an unusual age (e.g., osteoporosis in a young patient).
- **Distinct features include**: **fragility of the skin**, with easy bruising and **broad (>1 cm), purplish striae**, and signs of **proximal myopathy** (difficulty standing from a chair without hands, climbing stairs).
- Clinical manifestations do not differ substantially among the different causes.
- In **ectopic ACTH syndrome**, **hyperpigmentation** of knuckles, scars, or friction areas can be observed due to stimulatory effects of excess ACTH and other POMC cleavage products on melanocytes.
- Patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome and some with ACC may experience a **more brisk onset and rapid progression** of symptoms, especially edema, hypokalemia, and hypertension.
- Cushing’s syndrome patients are at acute risk of **deep vein thrombosis** and pulmonary embolism due to a hypercoagulable state.
- Most patients experience **psychiatric symptoms**, mainly anxiety or depression, but acute paranoid or depressive psychosis may occur.
- Even after cure, long-term health can be affected by impaired quality of life and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.

#### Diagnosis

- The most important first step is to **establish the correct diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome beyond doubt** before employing differential diagnosis tests.
- Exogenous glucocorticoid use must be excluded.
- Suspected cases with multiple and progressive features, especially those with higher discriminatory value, should be tested.
- Exclusion of Cushing’s is also indicated in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses.
- Diagnosis is established if several tests are consistently suggestive:
    - **Increased 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion** in three separate collections.
    - **Failure to appropriately suppress morning cortisol** after overnight dexamethasone exposure.
    - Evidence of **loss of diurnal cortisol secretion** with high levels at midnight.
- Factors potentially affecting test outcomes must be excluded, such as incomplete 24-hour urine collection or rapid inactivation of dexamethasone due to CYP3A4-inducing drugs (e.g., antiepileptics, rifampicin). Concurrent oral contraceptives can raise CBG and total cortisol, causing false non-suppression; testing should be repeated after 4–6 weeks off estrogens if in doubt.
- Patients with pseudo-Cushing states (alcohol-related) and cyclic Cushing’s may require further testing.
- Biochemical assays: tandem mass spectrometry has greatly improved specificity for urinary free cortisol measurement compared to antibody-based assays.

#### Differential Diagnosis

- Evaluation by an endocrinologist begins with differentiating **ACTH-dependent from ACTH-independent cortisol excess**.
- **Plasma ACTH levels**:
    - **Suppressed** in autonomous adrenal cortisol excess due to enhanced negative feedback.
    - **Normal or increased** in ACTH-dependent Cushing’s, with very high levels in some ectopic ACTH syndrome patients.
- **Imaging should only be used after ACTH-dependency is established**, as pituitary or adrenal nodules are common incidentally.
- **ACTH-independent Excess**:
    - **Adrenal imaging** (preferably unenhanced CT scan) is indicated to assess morphology and precontrast tumor density (Hounsfield units [HUs]) to distinguish benign from malignant lesions.
- **ACTH-dependent Cortisol Excess**:
    - **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary** is the investigation of choice, though it may not show abnormalities in up to 40% of cases due to small tumors.
    - Pituitary corticotrope adenomas typically **fail to enhance** following gadolinium administration on T1-weighted MRI.
    - Further tests differentiate pituitary Cushing’s disease from ectopic ACTH syndrome by exploiting regulatory features:
        - Most pituitary corticotrope adenomas still show residual ACTH suppression by high-dose glucocorticoids and CRH responsiveness.
        - Ectopic ACTH sources are typically **resistant to dexamethasone suppression and unresponsive to CRH**. (Note: a small minority of ectopic tumors may exhibit similar dynamic responses).
    - If results are discordant or in doubt, **bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS)** with concurrent ACTH blood sampling is performed.
        - An increased central/peripheral plasma ACTH ratio **>2 at baseline and >3 at 2–5 minutes after CRH injection** is indicative of Cushing’s disease with high sensitivity and specificity.
        - IPSS results **cannot reliably be used for lateralization** within the pituitary.
        - **No cortisol-lowering agents should be used prior to IPSS**.
- **Suspected Ectopic ACTH Syndrome**:
    - Further imaging includes **high-resolution, fine-cut CT scanning of the chest and abdomen** to scrutinize lung, thymus, and pancreas.
    - If no lesions are identified, **MRI of the chest** can be considered as carcinoid tumors often show high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
    - **Octreotide scintigraphy** can be helpful as ectopic ACTH-producing tumors often express somatostatin receptors.
    - Patients should also undergo blood sampling for fasting gut hormones, chromogranin A, calcitonin, and biochemical exclusion of pheochromocytoma.

#### Treatment

- Overt Cushing’s has a **poor prognosis if left untreated**.
- **ACTH-independent Disease**: Treatment involves **surgical removal of the adrenal tumor**. Minimally invasive approaches are used for smaller tumors, while an open approach is preferred for larger tumors or suspected malignancies.
- **Cushing’s Disease**: The treatment of choice is **selective removal of the pituitary corticotrope tumor**, usually via an endoscopic transsphenoidal approach, with an initial cure rate of **70–80%** by an experienced surgeon. Long-term follow-up is essential due to late relapse. Recurrence options include second surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and bilateral adrenalectomy, applied individually.
- **Medical Therapy**:
    - May be necessary for rapid cortisol control in **severe, overt Cushing’s** (e.g., difficult-to-control hypokalemic hypertension, acute psychosis) prior to surgery, and for long-term treatment of metastasized, glucocorticoid-producing carcinomas.
    - In ectopic ACTH syndrome where the tumor cannot be located, medical treatment or bilateral adrenalectomy (providing immediate cure but requiring lifelong corticosteroid replacement) must be considered, along with regular imaging follow-up for the ectopic source.
    - **Oral agents with established efficacy**:
        - **Metyrapone**: inhibits cortisol synthesis at **11β-hydroxylase** (typical starting dose 500 mg tid, max 6 g).
        - **Ketoconazole**: inhibits **early steps of steroidogenesis** (typical starting dose 200 mg tid, max 1200 mg).
        - **Osilodrostat**: a potent **11β-hydroxylase inhibitor**, also strongly inhibits aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2).
        - **Mitotane**: an adrenolytic agent (derivative of o,p’DDD), effective for reducing cortisol. Most commonly used in ACC due to its side effect profile, but low-dose (500–1000 mg/d) can be used in benign Cushing’s.
    - For severe cortisol excess, **etomidate** (continuous IV infusion in low, nonanesthetic doses) potently blocks 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase.
    - For Cushing’s disease if surgical cure is not achieved, **pasireotide** (subcutaneous somatostatin receptor agonist) is an option.
- **Post-Treatment Adrenal Suppression**:
    - After successful removal of an ACTH- or cortisol-producing tumor, the **HPA axis remains suppressed**.
    - **Hydrocortisone replacement** must be initiated at the time of surgery and slowly tapered after recovery to allow adaptation to normal cortisol levels.
    - HPA axis recovery can take months or years and may not fully recover.
    - **Recovery rates**: Ectopic ACTH syndrome shows the best recovery rate (80%), adrenal Cushing’s the lowest (40%), and Cushing’s disease is intermediate (60%).

### Mineralocorticoid Excess

#### Epidemiology

- Initially thought rare, but now recognized in **5–12% of hypertension patients**.
- Prevalence is higher when patients are preselected for **hypokalemic hypertension**.

#### Etiology

- Most common cause is **primary aldosteronism**, reflecting excess aldosterone production by the adrenal zona glomerulosa.
- **Bilateral micronodular hyperplasia** is slightly more common than unilateral adrenal adenomas.
- **Somatic mutations in channels and enzymes** (responsible for increasing sodium and calcium influx in adrenal zona glomerulosa cells) are prevalent causes of aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas.
- **Germline mutations** can also cause primary aldosteronism due to bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia.
- Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is usually micronodular but can contain larger nodules.
- Rarely caused by an **ACC** (consider in younger patients and those with larger tumors, as benign adenomas are usually <2 cm).
- **Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)** is a rare cause, resulting from a **chimeric gene** formed by crossover of promoter sequences between _CYP11B1_ and _CYP11B2_.
    - This rearrangement places _CYP11B2_ transcription under the control of ACTH receptor signaling, making aldosterone production regulated by ACTH rather than renin.
    - Family history of dominant transmission of hypertension can be helpful.
    - It is important to recognize due to its association with **early-onset hypertension and strokes**.
    - **Glucocorticoid suppression can reduce aldosterone production** in GRA.
- **Excess binding and activation of the MR by a steroid other than aldosterone**:
    - **Cortisol** can act as a potent mineralocorticoid if it escapes efficient inactivation to cortisone by **11β-HSD2** in the kidney.
        - This can be due to **inactivating mutations in the HSD11B2 gene**, causing **syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (SAME)** (severe hypokalemic hypertension in childhood; milder mutations cause normokalemic hypertension in adulthood).
        - **Inhibition of 11β-HSD2 by excess licorice ingestion**.
        - **Overwhelming of 11β-HSD2 conversion capacity by cortisol excess in Cushing’s syndrome**.
    - **DOC** also binds and activates the MR, causing hypertension if its concentrations are increased. This can occur from autonomous DOC secretion by an ACC, or DOC accumulation due to an adrenal enzymatic block (e.g., congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH] due to CYP11B1 or CYP17A1 deficiency).
    - **Progesterone** can cause hypokalemic hypertension in rare individuals with an MR mutation that enhances binding and activation by progesterone.
- **Mutations in the β or γ subunits of the ENaC**: disrupt its interaction with Nedd4, decreasing receptor internalization and degradation.
    - This leads to a **constitutively active ENaC** driving hypokalemic hypertension, resulting in an autosomal dominant disorder called **Liddle’s syndrome**.

#### Clinical Manifestations

- Excess MR activation leads to **potassium depletion** and **increased sodium retention**, expanding extracellular and plasma volume.
- Increased ENaC activity also causes hydrogen depletion, leading to **metabolic alkalosis**.
- Aldosterone has direct effects on the vascular system, increasing cardiac remodeling and decreasing compliance. It can directly damage the myocardium and kidney glomeruli, in addition to secondary damage from systemic hypertension.
- The clinical hallmark is **hypokalemic hypertension**, though only **50% of patients with primary aldosteronism exhibit hypokalemia**.
- Serum sodium tends to be normal due to fluid retention, which can sometimes lead to peripheral edema.
- Hypomagnesemia is common.
- Hypokalemia can be exacerbated by thiazide diuretics.
- Severe hypokalemia can cause muscle weakness, proximal myopathy, or even hypokalemic paralysis.
- Severe alkalosis contributes to muscle cramps and, in severe cases, tetany.
- Patients with primary aldosteronism show **increased rates of osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive dysfunction**.
- A significant proportion suffer from **concurrent mild autonomous cortisol excess (MACE)**, termed **Connshing syndrome**.

#### Diagnosis

- Diagnostic screening for mineralocorticoid excess is not recommended for all hypertension patients, but for those with **drug resistance, hypokalemia, an adrenal mass, or disease onset before age 40**.
- The accepted screening test is concurrent measurement of **plasma renin and aldosterone** with subsequent calculation of the **aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR)**. Serum potassium needs to be normalized before testing.
- MR antagonists should be ceased at least 4 weeks before ARR measurement. Other antihypertensives usually don't affect results, but beta blockers can cause false-positives and ACE/AT1R inhibitors false-negatives.
- **ARR is positive if >750 pmol/L per ng/mL per hour**, with concurrently high normal or increased aldosterone.
- A false-positive ARR is more likely when renin levels are very low. Tandem mass spectrometry assays are more reliable than antibody-based assays for aldosterone measurement.
- **Diagnostic confirmation** for a positive ARR should be done by an endocrinologist.
    - The most straightforward is the **saline infusion test**: IV administration of 2 L physiologic saline over 4 hours. Failure of aldosterone to suppress **<140 pmol/L (5 ng/dL)** indicates autonomous mineralocorticoid excess.
    - Alternative tests include the **oral sodium loading test** or the **fludrocortisone suppression test** (the latter carries risk of profound hypokalemia and increased hypertension).
    - Confirmatory testing is usually unnecessary in patients with overt hypokalemic hypertension, strongly positive ARR, and increased aldosterone.

#### Differential Diagnosis and Treatment

- After hyperaldosteronism is established, **adrenal imaging** (fine-cut CT scanning) is used to assess the cause.
    - CT provides excellent visualization; most aldosterone-producing adenomas are **<1 cm**. It identifies larger suspicious tumors but may miss lesions <5 mm.
- Differentiation between bilateral micronodular hyperplasia and a unilateral adenoma is needed only if surgery is feasible and desired.
- **Selective adrenal vein sampling (AVS)** should only be performed in **surgical candidates**:
    - Patients with no obvious lesion on CT, or those with a unilateral lesion but aged >40 years (due to high likelihood of coincidental endocrine-inactive adrenal adenoma).
    - AVS compares aldosterone levels in the inferior vena cava and between the right and left adrenal veins.
    - Concurrent **cortisol measurement** is required to confirm correct catheter placement (cortisol gradient >3 between vena cava and each adrenal vein).
    - **Lateralization is confirmed** by an aldosterone/cortisol ratio at least twofold higher on one side.
    - AVS is a complex procedure requiring a highly skilled interventional radiologist; cannulating the right adrenal vein can be difficult.
- **Treatment**:
    - Patients **<40 years with confirmed mineralocorticoid excess and a unilateral lesion on CT** can proceed directly to **surgery** (laparoscopic adrenalectomy is preferred). Surgery is also indicated if valid AVS confirms lateralization.
    - Patients who are not surgical candidates, or with evidence of bilateral hyperplasia, should be treated medically. Medical treatment can also be considered pre-surgery to prevent postsurgical hypoaldosteronism.
    - **Medical treatment primarily consists of MR antagonists**:
        - **Spironolactone**: 12.5–50 mg bid, titrated up to 400 mg/d to control blood pressure and normalize potassium. Side effects include menstrual irregularity, decreased libido, and gynecomastia.
        - **Eplerenone** (more selective MR antagonist): starts at 25 mg bid, titrated up to 200 mg/d.
        - The sodium channel blocker **amiloride** (5–10 mg bid) is also useful.
    - **GRA treatment**: Dexamethasone is administered at the lowest dose to control blood pressure; some patients may also need additional MR antagonist treatment. Diagnosis can be made via genetic testing if there is normal adrenal morphology and a family history of early-onset, severe hypertension.
    - **Non-aldosterone-related mineralocorticoid excess** is diagnosed by suppressed renin and suppressed aldosterone in the presence of hypokalemic hypertension.
        - **Urinary steroid metabolite profiling by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)** is used.
        - An increased free cortisol over free cortisone ratio suggests **SAME** and can be treated with dexamethasone.
        - GC/MS also detects steroids associated with CYP11B1 and CYP17A1 deficiency or the irregular steroid secretion pattern in a DOC-producing ACC.
        - If the GC/MS profile is normal, **Liddle’s syndrome** should be considered; it is very sensitive to amiloride but will not respond to MR antagonist treatment.

### Approach to the Patient: Incidentally Discovered Adrenal Mass ("Incidentaloma")

#### Epidemiology

- Common, with a prevalence of **2–5%** in the general population, increasing with age (1% of 40-year-olds, 7% of 70-year-olds).
- Widespread use of cross-sectional imaging has increased its recognized prevalence.

#### Etiology

- Most solitary adrenal tumors are **monoclonal neoplasms**.
- Several **genetic syndromes** can include adrenal tumors: MEN 1 (_MEN1_), MEN 2 (_RET_), Carney’s complex (_PRKAR1A_), and McCune-Albright (_GNAS1_). Somatic mutations in _MEN1_, _GNAS1_, and _PRKAR1A_ have been identified in some sporadic adrenocortical adenomas.
- **Aberrant expression of membrane receptors** (e.g., GIP, α- and β-adrenergic, luteinizing hormone, vasopressin V1, and interleukin 1 receptors) has been found in some sporadic cases of macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia.
- The majority of adrenal nodules are **endocrine-inactive adrenocortical adenomas**.
- Up to **25% are hormonally active** (cortisol- or aldosterone-producing adenoma, or pheochromocytoma).
- **ACC is rare**, but causes 5% of adrenal masses.
- **Metastases** from other solid tissue tumors are another cause, with higher incidence in patients undergoing imaging for tumor staging or follow-up.

#### Differential Diagnosis and Treatment

- Adrenal masses **>1 cm** require diagnostic evaluation.
- Two key questions: (1) Does the tumor autonomously secrete hormones that could harm health? (2) Is the adrenal mass benign or malignant?.
- Hormone secretion exists on a continuum, with clinical manifestations increasing with hormone levels.
- **Mandatory diagnostic workup**: exclusion of **catecholamine excess from a pheochromocytoma**.
- Exclusion of **autonomous cortisol resulting in Cushing’s syndrome**.
- In patients with hypertension or low serum potassium, also exclude **primary aldosteronism**.
- **Mild autonomous cortisol excess (MACE)**: patients usually lack overt Cushing’s features but may exhibit components of metabolic syndrome (obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension). Optimal treatment for MACE is debated.
- Overproduction of adrenal androgen precursors (DHEA and DHEAS) is rare, most frequently seen in ACC, as are increased levels of steroid precursors like 17OHP.

#### Imaging for Benign vs. Malignant Masses

- Imaging is relatively sensitive but has suboptimal specificity.
- **Unenhanced CT** is the procedure of choice.
- ACC, pheochromocytoma, and benign adrenal myelolipoma are more likely with increasing mass diameter, but **size alone is a poor predictor** (only 80% specificity for a 4-cm cutoff). Metastases are found with similar frequency regardless of size.
- **Tumor attenuation value on unenhanced CT** is highly diagnostic:
    - Many adrenocortical adenomas are **lipid-rich** and have **low attenuation values (<20 Hounsfield units [HUs])**.
    - However, many adenomas are lipid-poor and have higher HUs, making differentiation from ACCs and pheochromocytomas difficult (both invariably have **high attenuation values (>20 HU)**).
- **Morphology**: Benign lesions are generally **rounded and homogenous**, while most malignant lesions appear **lobulated and inhomogeneous**. Pheochromocytoma and adrenomyelolipoma can also exhibit lobulated and inhomogeneous features.
- **MRI**: offers somewhat lower resolution than CT but is preferred in children, young adults, and during pregnancy due to no ionizing radiation.
    - MRI is valuable for characterizing indeterminate adrenal lesions using **chemical shift analysis**; malignant tumors rarely show loss of signal on opposed-phase MRI, but this can also be observed in some benign adrenocortical adenomas.

#### Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) / CT-guided Biopsy

- **Very rarely indicated**.
- FNA of a pheochromocytoma can cause a life-threatening hypertensive crisis.
- FNA of an ACC violates the tumor capsule and can cause needle track metastasis.
- **Only consider FNA** in patients with a history of nonadrenal malignancy and a newly detected adrenal mass, **after careful exclusion of pheochromocytoma**, and if the outcome will influence therapeutic management.
- Notably, in 25% of patients with a history of nonadrenal malignancy, a newly detected adrenal mass is not a metastasis.
- FNA can diagnose extra-adrenal malignancies but has **very limited ability to differentiate between benign and malignant adrenocortical lesions**, so it should **not be used for ACC diagnosis**.

#### Treatment of Adrenal Masses

- Adrenal masses with **confirmed hormone excess or suspected malignancy** are usually treated surgically (adrenalectomy) or with medication if surgery is not feasible.
- Preoperative exclusion of glucocorticoid excess is crucial for predicting postoperative suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland, which necessitates peri- and postoperative glucocorticoid replacement.
- Adrenal masses with **normal endocrine biochemistry** and a tumor radiodensity of **<20 HU on unenhanced CT**can be considered **benign** and require no further follow-up.
- For adrenal masses with **suspicious imaging findings (>20 HU)**, further tests and surgery are options, though surgery may still be unnecessary for benign tumors.
- **Urine steroid metabolomics**, a recently introduced diagnostic test, has a **twofold higher positive predictive value than imaging in detecting ACC**, based on a distinct "steroid fingerprint" with accumulating precursor steroids.

### Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC)

- ACC is a **rare malignancy** with an annual incidence of **1–2 per million population**.
- It is generally considered highly malignant, but shows broad interindividual variability in biologic characteristics and clinical behavior.
- **Genetic Factors**:
    - **Somatic mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene TP53** are found in 25% of apparently sporadic ACC.
    - **Germline TP53 mutations** cause **Li-Fraumeni syndrome** (associated with multiple solid organ cancers, including ACC) and are found in 25% of pediatric ACC cases; the R337H _TP53_ mutation is in almost all pediatric ACC in Brazil.
    - Other genetic changes include alterations in the **Wnt/β-catenin pathway** and the **insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) cluster**; **IGF2 overexpression** is found in 90% of ACCs.

#### Management

- Large adrenal tumors suspicious of malignancy should be managed by a **multidisciplinary specialist team**(endocrinologist, oncologist, surgeon, radiologist, histopathologist).
- **FNA is not indicated in suspected ACC** because cytology and histopathology of a core biopsy cannot differentiate between benign and malignant primary adrenal masses, and FNA violates the tumor capsule, risking needle canal metastasis.
- Even with the entire tumor specimen, histopathologic differentiation between benign and malignant adrenocortical lesions is challenging.
- The most common histopathologic classification is the **Weiss score**, which considers elements like high nuclear grade, mitotic rate (>5/HPF), atypical mitosis, <25% clear cells, diffuse architecture, and presence of necrosis, venous invasion, and invasion of sinusoidal structures and tumor capsule. The presence of **three or more elements suggests ACC**.
- FNA is feasible if looking for metastases of an extra-adrenal primary or other adrenal tumor entities, such as ganglioneuroma.

#### Hormone Production and Staging

- **60–70% of ACCs show biochemical evidence of steroid overproduction**, though often not clinically apparent due to inefficient production.
- **Excess production of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgen precursors** are most common and indicative of malignancy.
- **Tumor staging at ACC diagnosis** has important prognostic implications and requires scanning the chest and abdomen for local organ invasion, lymphadenopathy, and metastases.
    - **Intravenous contrast medium is necessary** for maximum sensitivity for hepatic metastases.
    - **Vascular and adjacent organ invasion is diagnostic of malignancy**.
    - **18-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18-FDG-PET)** is highly sensitive for malignancy detection and can detect small metastases or local recurrence, but has limited specificity and cannot differentiate benign from malignant adrenal lesions.
    - Metastasis in ACC most frequently occurs to the **liver and lung**.

#### Prognosis and Treatment

- There is no established grading system for ACC, and the Weiss score has no prognostic value.
- The most important prognostic histopathologic parameter is the **Ki67 proliferation index**:
    - **Ki67 <10%** indicates slow to moderate growth velocity.
    - **Ki67 ≥10%** is associated with poor prognosis, high recurrence risk, and rapid progression.
- **Cure of ACC can only be achieved by early detection and complete surgical removal**.
- **Major determinants of poor survival** include capsule violation during primary surgery, metastasis at diagnosis, and primary treatment in a nonspecialist center or by a nonspecialist surgeon.
- If the primary tumor invades adjacent organs, **en bloc removal of kidney and spleen** may reduce recurrence risk, and regional lymph node dissection may further reduce this risk.
- Surgery can also be considered for patients with metastases if there is severe tumor-related hormone excess, carefully weighing surgical risk against therapeutic delay.
- **Adjuvant treatment with mitotane (o,p’DDD)** should be given to patients with confirmed ACC and successful primary tumor removal, particularly those with high recurrence risk (tumor size >8 cm, vascular/capsule invasion/violation, Ki67 ≥10%).
    - Adjuvant mitotane should be continued for **at least 2 years** if tolerated.
    - Regular monitoring of **plasma mitotane levels is mandatory** (therapeutic range **14–20 mg/L**; neurotoxic complications more frequent at >20 mg/L).
    - Mitotane typically starts at 500 mg tid, with stepwise increases to a maximum of 2000 mg tid, then tapered to maintenance doses (1000–1500 mg tid).
    - Mitotane disrupts cortisol synthesis, requiring **glucocorticoid replacement** (at least double the usual adrenal insufficiency dose, i.e., 20 mg tid) because it induces hepatic CYP3A4 activity, rapidly inactivating glucocorticoids, and increases circulating CBG.
- Single metastases can be addressed surgically or with radiofrequency ablation.
- If the tumor recurs or progresses during mitotane treatment, **cytotoxic chemotherapy** should be considered; the established first-line regimen is **cisplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin plus continuing mitotane**.
- Painful bone metastasis responds to irradiation.
- Overall survival in ACC is poor, with **5-year survival rates of 30–40%** and a median survival of 15 months in metastatic ACC.

### Adrenal Insufficiency

#### Epidemiology

- Prevalence of well-documented, permanent adrenal insufficiency is **5 in 10,000**.
- **Hypothalamic-pituitary origin (secondary)** is most frequent, with a prevalence of 3 in 10,000.
- **Primary adrenal insufficiency** has a prevalence of 2 in 10,000.
    - Approximately half of primary cases are acquired (mostly autoimmune destruction), and the other half are genetic (most commonly distinct enzymatic blocks in adrenal steroidogenesis affecting glucocorticoid synthesis, e.g., CAH).
- **Iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency** (from exogenous glucocorticoid treatment) is much more common, occurring in **0.5–2% of the population** in developed countries.

#### Etiology

- **Primary Adrenal Insufficiency**:
    - Most commonly caused by **autoimmune adrenalitis**.
        - Isolated autoimmune adrenalitis accounts for 30–40%.
        - 60–70% develop adrenal insufficiency as part of **autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APSs)**.
            - **APS1 (APECED)**: 10% of APS patients, autosomal recessive, caused by mutations in the **autoimmune regulator gene AIRE**. Associated conditions include total alopecia, primary hypoparathyroidism, and rarely lymphoma. Patients invariably develop **chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis**, usually in childhood, preceding adrenal insufficiency by years or decades.
            - **APS2**: more prevalent, polygenic inheritance, with associations to the HLA-DR3 gene region and immune regulation genes (CTLA-4, PTPN22, CLEC16A). Coincident autoimmune diseases most frequently include thyroid autoimmune disease, vitiligo, and premature ovarian failure; less commonly, type 1 diabetes and pernicious anemia.
    - **X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy**: incidence of 1:20,000 males, caused by mutations in the **X-ALD gene (_ABCD1_)**.
        - Disruption leads to **accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids** (>24 carbon atoms).
        - Approximately 50% manifest in early childhood with rapidly progressive white matter disease (cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy).
        - 35% present in adolescence or early adulthood with neurologic features of myelin and peripheral nervous system involvement (adrenomyeloneuropathy [AMN]).
        - In the remaining 15%, adrenal insufficiency is the sole manifestation. Distinct mutations show variable penetrance and phenotypes.
    - Rarer causes involve adrenal gland destruction from **infection** (tuberculous adrenalitis is common in developing countries), hemorrhage, or infiltration. Adrenal metastases rarely cause adrenal insufficiency, only with bilateral, bulky metastases.
    - **Inborn causes (genetic, <1% of cases)**: mutations in factors regulating adrenal development and steroidogenesis (DAX-1, SF-1), cholesterol synthesis/import/cleavage (DHCR7, StAR, CYP11A1), adrenal ACTH response pathway (MC2R, MRAP), and factors involved in redox regulation (NNT, TXNRD2) and DNA repair (MCM4, CDKN1C).
- **Secondary (or Central) Adrenal Insufficiency**:
    - Consequence of **dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary component of the HPA axis**.
    - Excluding iatrogenic suppression, most cases are caused by **pituitary or hypothalamic tumors or their treatment** (surgery or irradiation).
    - Rarer causes include pituitary apoplexy (infarcted pituitary adenoma or transient reduction in pituitary blood supply during surgery or after rapid blood loss during parturition, also called Sheehan’s syndrome).
    - Isolated ACTH deficiency is rarely caused by autoimmune disease or pituitary infiltration.
    - Genetic causes include mutations in the **ACTH precursor POMC** or in factors regulating pituitary development.

#### Clinical Manifestations

- **Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease)** is characterized by the loss of **both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion**.
- In **secondary adrenal insufficiency**, only **glucocorticoid deficiency** is present, as the adrenal gland is intact and still regulated by the RAA system.
- **Adrenal androgen secretion is disrupted in both** primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency.
- Hypothalamic-pituitary disease can lead to additional manifestations from involvement of other endocrine axes (thyroid, gonads, GH, prolactin) or visual impairment (bitemporal hemianopia from chiasmal compression).
- **Iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency** from exogenous glucocorticoid suppression can cause all symptoms of glucocorticoid deficiency if stopped abruptly, but patients will appear cushingoid from prior overexposure.
- **Chronic adrenal insufficiency** presents with nonspecific signs like fatigue and loss of energy, often leading to delayed or missed diagnoses (e.g., as depression or anorexia).
- A distinguishing feature of **primary adrenal insufficiency is hyperpigmentation**, caused by excess ACTH stimulation of melanocytes, most pronounced in friction areas and increased by sunlight.
- Conversely, in **secondary adrenal insufficiency**, the skin has an **alabaster-like paleness** due to lack of ACTH secretion.
- **Hyponatremia** is a characteristic biochemical feature in primary adrenal insufficiency (80% of patients at presentation), primarily due to mineralocorticoid deficiency. It can also occur in secondary adrenal insufficiency due to diminished inhibition of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release by cortisol.
- **Hyperkalemia** is present in 40% of primary adrenal insufficiency patients.
- Glucocorticoid deficiency also results in slightly increased TSH concentrations that normalize after glucocorticoid replacement.
- **Acute Adrenal Insufficiency (Adrenal Crisis)**:
    - Usually occurs after a prolonged period of nonspecific complaints and is more frequent in primary adrenal insufficiency due to loss of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion.
    - Postural hypotension can progress to hypovolemic shock.
    - May mimic acute abdomen (abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, fever).
    - May resemble neurologic disease (decreased responsiveness progressing to stupor and coma).
    - Triggered by intercurrent illness, surgical or other stress, or increased glucocorticoid inactivation (e.g., hyperthyroidism).
    - Prospective data indicate 8.3 adrenal crises and 0.5 adrenal crisis-related deaths per 100 patient-years.

#### Diagnosis

- Diagnosis is established by the **short cosyntropin test**, a safe and reliable tool.
    - Failure cutoff is usually cortisol levels **<450–500 nmol/L (16–18 μg/dL)** sampled 30–60 minutes after ACTH stimulation (exact cutoff depends on assay).
    - During the early phase of HPA disruption (e.g., within 4 weeks of pituitary insufficiency), patients may still respond to exogenous ACTH. In this case, the **ITT** is an alternative, but more invasive and requires specialist supervision. ITT is contraindicated in individuals with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or history of seizures.
- **Random serum cortisol measurements have limited diagnostic value** due to the physiologic diurnal rhythm.
- Many patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency have relatively normal baseline cortisol levels but fail to mount an appropriate response to ACTH stimulation.
- **Diagnostic tests should never delay treatment**; in suspected adrenal crisis, draw baseline cortisol, provide replacement therapy, and defer formal testing.
- Once adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, **plasma ACTH measurement** is the next step:
    - **Increased ACTH** defines primary origin.
    - **Inappropriately low ACTH** defines secondary origin.
- In **primary adrenal insufficiency**, **increased plasma renin will confirm mineralocorticoid deficiency**.
    - Patients should be screened for **steroid autoantibodies** (marker of autoimmune adrenalitis).
    - If autoantibodies are negative, **adrenal imaging by CT** is indicated to investigate hemorrhage, infiltration, or masses.
    - In male patients with negative autoantibodies, **very-long-chain fatty acids should be measured to exclude X-ALD**.
- Patients with inappropriately low ACTH and confirmed cortisol deficiency should undergo **hypothalamic-pituitary imaging by MRI**. Features of preceding pituitary apoplexy should be explored, especially if no obvious MRI lesion.

#### Treatment

- **Acute Adrenal Insufficiency (Adrenal Crisis)**:
    - Requires immediate initiation of **rehydration** (saline infusion, initially 1 L/h, with continuous cardiac monitoring).
    - **Glucocorticoid replacement**: **100 mg hydrocortisone bolus**, followed by **200 mg hydrocortisone over 24 hours** (continuous infusion or bolus IV/IM injections).
    - **Mineralocorticoid replacement** can be initiated once daily hydrocortisone dose is <50 mg, as higher doses provide sufficient MR stimulation.
- **Chronic Adrenal Insufficiency**:
    - **Glucocorticoid replacement**: oral **15–25 mg hydrocortisone in two to three divided doses** usually replaces physiologic daily cortisol production.
    - Pregnancy may require a 50% increase in hydrocortisone dose during the last trimester.
    - At least half of the daily dose should be administered in the morning.
    - Currently available glucocorticoid preparations do not mimic the physiologic cortisol secretion rhythm.
    - **Long-acting glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisolone or dexamethasone) are not preferred** due to increased glucocorticoid exposure and extended GR activation at times of physiologically low cortisol secretion.
    - **Equipotency guideline**: 1 mg hydrocortisone ≈ 1.6 mg cortisone acetate ≈ 0.2 mg prednisolone ≈ 0.25 mg prednisone ≈ 0.025 mg dexamethasone.
    - **Monitoring**: mainly based on history and examination for signs of over- or under-replacement (body weight, blood pressure). Plasma ACTH, 24-hour urinary free cortisol, or serum cortisol day curves indicate intake but not replacement quality.
    - For isolated primary adrenal insufficiency, monitor for autoimmune thyroid disease; inform female patients about possible premature ovarian failure.
    - Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment (doses equivalent to ≥30 mg hydrocortisone) affects bone metabolism; regular bone mineral density evaluation is needed.
    - **Stress-related glucocorticoid dose adjustments**: **doubling the routine oral glucocorticoid dose for intercurrent illness with fever and bed rest**; **immediate IV or IM injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone followed by intravenous infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24 h for prolonged vomiting, surgery, or trauma**.
    - All patients should carry a **hydrocortisone self-injection emergency kit**, steroid emergency cards/bracelets, and receive training in its use.
    - **Mineralocorticoid replacement (Primary AI)**: initiated with **100–150 μg fludrocortisone**.
        - Adequacy is evaluated by measuring blood pressure (sitting and standing for postural drop) and regularly measuring serum sodium, potassium, and plasma renin.
        - **Renin levels should be kept in the upper normal reference range**.
        - Glucocorticoid dose changes can impact mineralocorticoid replacement (40 mg hydrocortisone ≈ 100 μg fludrocortisone).
        - Prednisone and prednisolone have reduced mineralocorticoid activity, and dexamethasone has none.
        - Fludrocortisone dose should be increased by 50–100 μg in hot/tropical conditions.
        - Dose adjustment during pregnancy (due to progesterone's antimineralocorticoid activity) is less often required than hydrocortisone adjustment. Plasma renin is not a reliable monitoring tool during pregnancy due to physiological rise.
    - **Adrenal androgen replacement**: an option for patients with lack of energy despite optimized glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement, and for women with features of androgen deficiency (e.g., loss of libido).
        - Achieved by once-daily administration of **25–50 mg DHEA**.
        - Monitored by measuring DHEAS, androstenedione, testosterone, and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) 24 hours after the last DHEA dose.

### Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

- CAH is caused by **mutations in genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes** involved in glucocorticoid synthesis (CYP21A2, CYP17A1, HSD3B2, CYP11B1) or in the cofactor enzyme P450 oxidoreductase.
- Patients invariably exhibit **glucocorticoid deficiency**.
- Depending on the exact enzymatic block, they may also have excess production of mineralocorticoids or deficient production of sex steroids.
- Diagnosis is established by **measurement of steroids accumulating before the distinct enzymatic block**, in serum or urine, preferably using mass spectrometry-based assays.

#### Variants of CAH (based on CYP21A2 Mutations)

- **CYP21A2 mutations (21-Hydroxylase deficiency)** are the **most prevalent cause of CAH (90–95% of cases)**.
- This deficiency disrupts both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis, leading to diminished negative feedback via the HPA axis. This results in increased pituitary ACTH release, which drives increased synthesis of adrenal androgen precursors and subsequent **androgen excess**.
- The severity of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid impairment depends on mutation severity:
    - **Major loss-of-function mutations** result in combined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency (**classic CAH, neonatal presentation**, often with salt-wasting crisis).
    - **Less severe mutations** affect only glucocorticoid synthesis (**simple virilizing CAH, neonatal or early childhood presentation**, with precocious pseudo-puberty and advanced bone age).
    - **Mildest mutations** result in **nonclassic CAH**, usually presenting during adolescence and early adulthood with preserved glucocorticoid production.
- **Androgen excess is present in all patients**, manifesting with broad phenotypic variability:
    - Severe virilization of external genitalia in neonatal girls (**46,XX disordered sex development [DSD]**).
    - Hirsutism and oligomenorrhea resembling polycystic ovary syndrome in young women with nonclassic CAH.
    - Boys with classic CAH (without neonatal screening) usually present with **life-threatening adrenal crisis** in the first weeks of life.
    - Men with nonclassic CAH are usually detected through family screening.
- **Glucocorticoid treatment is complex**, as it must replace missing glucocorticoids and control increased ACTH drive/androgen excess.
- Current treatment is hindered by the lack of glucocorticoid preparations that mimic the diurnal cortisol secretion profile, leading to prolonged ACTH stimulation and androgen production in the early morning.
- **In childhood**, treatment goals include optimizing growth and pubertal development, preventing adrenal crisis, and treating 46,XX DSD.
- **In adults**, the focus shifts to preserving fertility and preventing glucocorticoid overtreatment side effects (metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis).
- **Fertility can be compromised in women** due to oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea with chronic anovulation caused by androgen excess.
- **Men may develop testicular adrenal rest tissue (TART)** (hyperplastic cells with shared adrenal and gonadal characteristics located in the rete testis, not testicular tumors). TART can compromise sperm production and induce irreversible testicular fibrosis.

#### Treatment of CAH

- **Hydrocortisone** is a good treatment option for preventing adrenal crisis.
    - In children, it's given in divided doses at 1–1.5 times the normal cortisol production rate (∼10–13 mg/m2 per day).
- **Longer-acting prednisolone** may be needed to control androgen excess.
- In adults, if hydrocortisone is insufficient, intermediate-acting glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) may be given at the lowest dose to suppress excess androgen production.
- **Dexamethasone** may be required for achieving fertility, but only for the shortest possible time to limit adverse metabolic side effects.
- The recent introduction of **modified and delayed-release hydrocortisone** is promising, effectively controlling steroid precursor excess with a lower daily dose than immediate-release hydrocortisone.
- **Biochemical monitoring** should include **androstenedione and testosterone**, aiming for the normal sex-specific reference range.
- **17OHP is a useful marker of overtreatment**, indicated by levels within the normal range of healthy controls.
- Glucocorticoid overtreatment may suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, so treatment needs careful titration against clinical features of disease control.
- **Stress-dose glucocorticoids** should be double or triple the daily dose for surgery, acute illness, or severe trauma.
- **Poorly controlled CAH** can result in **adrenocortical hyperplasia**, which may present as **macronodular hyperplasia** subsequent to long-standing ACTH excess. These nodular areas can develop autonomous adrenal androgen production and may be unresponsive to glucocorticoid treatment.
- The prevalence of **adrenomyelolipomas** is increased in CAH; these are benign but may require surgical intervention due to lack of self-limiting growth.
- **Mineralocorticoid requirements change during life and are higher in children** due to relative mineralocorticoid resistance that diminishes with kidney maturation.
    - Children with CAH usually receive mineralocorticoid and salt replacement.
    - Young adults with CAH should undergo reassessment of their mineralocorticoid reserve.
    - **Plasma renin** should be regularly monitored and kept within the upper half of the normal reference range.

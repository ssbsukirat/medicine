* Common metabolic disorders that share phenotype of hyperglycemia
* Factors contributing to DM 
    * Reduced insulin secretion
    * Reduced glucose utilisation
    * Increased glucose production
* May affect multiple organs. Leading cause of 
    * ESRD
    * Non traumatic lower limb amputation
    * Adult blindness
    * Increased risk of CV disease
        * Main cause of mortality and morbidity

# Classification
* Basis of pathogenic process
* Type 1 or 2 are major categories
* "atypical" forms exist
    * May share features of both 1 and 2
* Type 1 
    * Autoimmunity against beta cells
    * Absolute insulin deficiency
* Type 2
    * Heterogeneous group
    * Insulin resistance
    * Low insulin secretion
    * Increased hepatic glucose production
    * Specific process if understood then specific drugs can be used
* Type 3 type from Harrison
* Stage of worsening glucose control before development of hyperglycemia
* ***Maturity onset diabetes of young or MODY***
    * Autosomal dominant
    * Earlier onset <25 years
    * Impaired insulin secretion
* Gestational DM
    * Second or third trimester
    * Increased insulin demand in pregnancy
    * If in first trimester it is pre-existing pregestational DM
    * Usually revert to normal post partum
    * 35-60% risk of developing DM in next decade
    * If GDM then lifelong screening of DM every 3 years
* Atypical DM
    * Before puberty
    * Lean individual
    * Not linked to single gene defects so different from MODY 
    * Ketosis prone diabetes may present in DKA
    * Do not require long-term insulin

# diagnosis
![[harrisons 2 part.png]]
* Consideration in diagnosis
    * Fasting glucose, OGTT, HbA1c are different in different individuals
    * DM is defined as glycemia at which diabetes specific complications occur rather than a specific point
    * Fasting glucose OGTT or HbA1c may not be deranged simultaneously in all individuals
    * but all have increased risk of cardiovascular complications
    * Must be counselled for risk control
* Values are continuous and not discrete
    * Risk increase continuously rather than discretely
* Diagnostic criteria
    * Fasting >126 
    * OGTT >200 after 2h
    * HbA1c >6.5% 
    * Classic symptoms (polyuria polydipsia weight loss) and random sugar> 200
    * Fasting and HbA1c best 
* Use OGTT only in pregnancy care and screening of GDM
* Abnormal screening should be repeated before confirming DM
* If tolerance returns to normal ***withdraw diagnosis of DM*** 

## screening
* Widespread use of fasting and HbA1c recommended
* Reasons for screening
    * Lot of DM patients are asymptomatic and unaware
    * DM maybe present for a decade before being diagnosed
    * May have one or more diabetes complication at diagnosis
    * Treatment alters natural history of DM
    * Prediabetes must start efforts of DM prevention

# Regulation of glucose homeostasis
## overall regulation of glucose homeostasis
* Balance between
    * Energy intake
    * Gluconeogenesis
    * Peripheral glucose uptake
* Regulators
    * ***Insulin***
    * Neural input
    * Metabolic signals
    * Hormones like glucagon
* Fasting
    * Low insulin
        * Reduced glucose utilisation
    * Slightly higher glucagon
        * Normally only in low glucose or insulin
        * During exercise
        * In DM, increase in fasting and post prandial
    * Hepatic gluconeogenesis 
    * Glycogenolysis
    * Increased gluconeogenic precursor like AAs and FFAs

## Insulin biosynthesis
- beta cells of pancreatic islets
- Single chain 86 AA ***preproinsulin***
- ***Proinsulin***
    - After amino terminal sequence removal
    - Related to IGF 1&2 which also bind weakly to insulin receptor
    - Elevated in both type 1&2 DM
    - Indicates beta cell dysfunction
- ***Insulin*** 
    - after removal of C-peptide
    - A and B chains joined by disulfide bond
    - Stored with C-peptide in secretory granules of beta cells
    - ***Glucose*** (>70) key regulator of secretion but also by 
        - AAs
        - Ketones
        - Nutrients
        - GI peptides
        - Neurotransmitters
    - ![[harrisons 2 part 2.png]]
    - Secreted in 2 phases
        - ***rapid*** first phase
            - impaired rapid phase is early anomaly in DM both 1 2
        - ***Prolonged*** second phase
    - Amplifiers of glucose mediated insulin secretion
        - ***incretins***
            - GLP-1
            - GIP (glucose dependant insulinotropic peptide)
            - Bind to receptor on beta cell
            - Increase cAMP
            - Only when glucose is above fasting
            - Also ***suppress glucagon*** release
            - Analogue used in management
            - Classical thought to be due to neuroendocrine L cells in GI tract
            - New studies suggest intra-islet production from alpha cells
    - Action
        - secreted into portal venous system
        - 50% cleared in first pass
        - Portal to peripheral ratio 2:1
        - uncleared insulin in peripheral circulation binds to skeletal muscle and adipose
        - Stimulates intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity
            - receptor autophosphorylation 
            - Recruitment of intracellular signalling molecules
            - IRS or insulin receptor substrates
            - Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions occur resulting in *mitogenic* and *metabolic* effects of insulin
            - PI-3-kinate pathway stimulates translocation of GLUT-4  to cell surface
- ***IAPP or amylin***
    - islet amyloid polypeptide
    - Co-secreted by beta cell with insulin
    - 37 AA structure
    - Major component of amyloid fibrils in islet of DM patients
    - Analogue used in type 1 2 DM both

# pathogenesis
## Type 1 DM
* interactions of Genetic, Environmental, immunological factors 
* immune mediated destruction of Beta-cells and insulin deficiency 
* Most have evidence of islet directed autoimmunity 
* Stages 
	* 1 -> presence of 2 or more autoantibodies 
	* 2 -> Continued autoimmunity and development of dysglycemia
	* 3-> hyperglycemia more than diagnostic threshold
* ![[harrisons 2 part 3.png]]
* Process likely triggered by infection or environmental trigger 
	* f/b gradual decline in beta cell dysfunction 
	* rate varies within individuals 
* Hyperglycemia occurs after sufficient loss of beta-cells 
* Beta-cells present but insufficient for maintaining glucose tolerance 
* Transition from glucose intolerance to frank diabetes triggered by increase in insulin demand like infection or puberty 
* After initial presentation, ***honeymoon*** period exists
	* Glycemic control achieved with low dose or no insulin
	* fleeting phase 
	* ends and patients become insulin deficient 
	* produce some insulin for very long as C-peptide levels are present 

### Genetic consideration in T1-DM
* Multigenic
* Identical twins 30-70%
	* implies other factors beyond genes 
* Major susceptibility area for DM on ***HLA region of chr. 6***
	* polymorphisms account for 50% of genetic risk
	* Class 2 MHC genes 
	* present antigen to Helper T-cells - dependant on amino acid structure 
	* initiate the immune process
	* DR3 and/or DR4
	* DQA1 * 0301, DQB1* 0302, and DQB1* 0201 increase risk
	* DQA1 * 0102, DQB1 * 0602 decrease risk
* Other genes (60)
	* Promoter region of insulin 
	* CTLA-4 genes 
	* IL-2 receptor 
	* PTPN22
* Environmental factors play major role
* Majority of T1-DM don't have relative with disease 
### Pathophsyiology
* Insulitis 
	* InflitrAtion of lymphocytes into islets 
	* heterogeneous frequency
* Anomalies
	* ***Islet Cell Autoantibodies (ICAs)***
		* Composite of antibodies 
		* GAD, insulin, IA-2/ICA-512, ZnT-8
		* marker for autoimmune activity 
		* if 2+ then stage 1 DM
		* identify individuals at risk
		* Not a direct role in pathogenesis 
	* Activated lymphocytes in islets and peripancreatic LNs
	* T-cells proliferating on islet protein exposure
		* CD8+ cells mediated cytotoxicity
		* Augmented by ***neoantigen*** production by islets 
		* increase by upregulation of MHC-1
	* Cytokine release in Insulitis 
		* TNF-alpha
		* INF-Gamma
		* IL-1
* Suppressing autoimmunity at diagnosis has little use
* Intervention early in disease course useful
	* stage 1 or 2
	* 14-day course of ***teplizumab*** delayed onset of stage 3 by 2.7 years 
		* this is a Fc receptor-nonbinding anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody
* Other islet cells  
	* types
		* alpha cells glucagon-producing 
		* delta cells somatostatin-producing 
		* PP cells pancreatic polypeptide-producing
	* Similar to beta cells 
	* spared in DM
	* Pattern maybe altered
		* Alpha cell dysfunction as fasting and post-prandial hyperglucagonemia but impaired response to hypoglycemia
* Environmental factors 
	* Viruses
		* Coxsackie
		* rubella
		* enterovirus
	* Bovine milk protein 
	* nitrosureas
	* vit D deficiency 
	* environmental toxins
	* Microbiome



## Type 2 DM
* Insulin resistance and abnormal insulin secretion central to pathogenesis 
* Usually ***Resistance before reduced secretion*** but DM develops only when secretion falls
* Latinos have more resistance and South and east asians have more beta cell dysfunction 
### Genetic consideration 
* Strong genetic component 
* 70-90% in identical twins 70% if parents have DM
* Insulin resistance ,as demonstrated by reduced glucose utilization in skeletal muscle, nondiabetic, first-degree relatives of individuals with type 2 DM.
* polygenetic and multifactorial
* Shared environmental and lifestyle factors 
* In-utero environmental affects
	* High or low birth weight 
	* Gestational hyperglycemia 
* Genes 
	* Transcription factor 7-like gene 2
	* peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ
	* inward rectifying potassium channel 
	* zinc transporter 
	* IRS 
	* calpain 10

### Pathophsyiology 
* Characterised by 
	* impaired insulin secretion 
	* insulin resistance 
	* excessive hepatic glucose production 
	* abnormal fat metabolism 
	* systemic low-grade inflammation
* ![[t2dmchart.png]]
* Initial compensatory increase in insulin despite resistance is sufficient to maintain glucose homeostasis 
* As hyperinsulinemia and resistance worsens, unable to sustain high insulin and ***IGT or increase in PP glucose develops*** 
* decline in insulin secretion and/or increased glucagon secretion causes an increase in hepatic glucose production leading to ***fasting hyperglycemia***

### Metabolic Abnormalities
* Insulin resistance 
	* Decrease in ability to act on target ti

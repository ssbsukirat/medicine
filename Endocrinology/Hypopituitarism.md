## Hypopituitarism

Hypopituitarism is characterized by the **deficient production of anterior pituitary hormones**. This condition can stem from inherited disorders, but in adults, it is more commonly acquired. Acquired hypopituitarism often results from the compressive mass effects of tumors or local pituitary/hypothalamic damage due to trauma, autoimmune issues, inflammation, or vascular damage. These processes can also impair the synthesis or secretion of hypothalamic hormones, leading to pituitary failure.

### Developmental Causes of Hypopituitarism

- **Pituitary dysplasia** may lead to aplastic, hypoplastic, or ectopic pituitary gland development.
    - This is linked to **midline craniofacial disorders** because pituitary development involves midline cell migration from the nasopharyngeal Rathke’s pouch.
- **Acquired pituitary failure in newborns** can be caused by birth trauma, including cranial hemorrhage, asphyxia, and breech delivery.
- **Genetic Mutations**:
    - Many **transcription factors and growth factors** are crucial for hypothalamic and pituitary development and the function of differentiated anterior pituitary cell lineages.
    - Mutations have been identified in genes such as HESX1, SOX2, SOX3, LHX3, LHX4, OTX, GLI2, PAX6, BMP4, ARNT2, FGF8, FGFR1, SHH, PROKR2, GPR161, IGSF1, PITX2, and CHD7.
    - **Effects**: Heterozygous loss-of-function or autosomal recessive mutations can disrupt hypothalamic and pituitary development at various stages.
    - **Phenotypes**: These mutations cause a wide range of phenotypes, from severe syndromic midline and other defects to combined pituitary hormone defects (CPHD) or isolated hormone deficiencies.
    - **Pituitary appearance**: The pituitary gland may be **hypoplastic, hyperplastic, or ectopic**, depending on the gene involved.
    - **Midline defects** associated with these mutations can include abnormal development of the eyes, corpus callosum, vertebrae, and genital systems.
    - **Specific Pituitary Cell Lineage Mutations**:
        - **Pit-1 mutations** cause combined **growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiencies**. Patients typically present with **growth failure** and varying degrees of **hypothyroidism**. The pituitary may appear hypoplastic on MRI.
        - **Prop-1 mutations** (familial and sporadic) affect early pituitary development and are required for Pit-1 function. They result in combined **GH, PRL, TSH, and gonadotropin deficiency**. Over 80% of these patients experience growth retardation. By adulthood, all are deficient in TSH and gonadotropins, and a small minority later develop ACTH deficiency. Due to gonadotropin deficiency, these individuals do not enter puberty spontaneously. In some cases, the pituitary gland may appear enlarged on MRI.
        - **TPIT mutations** result in **ACTH deficiency** associated with hypocortisolism.
        - **NR5A1 (steroidogenic factor 1 [SF1]) mutations** impair the development of gonadotrope cells, as well as adrenal and gonadal development.

### Hypothalamic Endocrine Dysfunction

Hypothalamic disorders can impact various functions, including temperature regulation, appetite, sleep-wake cycles, autonomic systems, behavior, and memory, in addition to multiple endocrine systems.

- **Kallmann Syndrome**:
    - **Cause**: Results from **defective hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis**.
    - **Associated Features**: Characterized by **anosmia or hyposmia** due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia. It may also be associated with color blindness, optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, renal abnormalities, cryptorchidism, and neurologic abnormalities like mirror movements.
    - **Genetics**: Initially linked to mutations in the **X-linked KAL gene**, which impair embryonic migration of GnRH neurons. More than a dozen additional genetic abnormalities (e.g., GPR54, KISS1, FGFR1, GNRH1, PROK2, PROKR2, CHD7, PCSK1, FGF8, NELF, WDR11, TAC3, TACR3, SEMA3E) have been found to cause isolated GnRH deficiency, with autosomal recessive and dominant modes of transmission. Some patients have oligogenic mutations, where mutations in a combination of different genes lead to the phenotype.
    - **Clinical Presentation**: GnRH deficiency **prevents progression through puberty**. Males present with delayed puberty and pronounced hypogonadal features, including micropenis. Females present with primary amenorrhea and failure of secondary sexual development.
    - **Laboratory Findings**: Characterized by **low luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels** and **low concentrations of sex steroids** (testosterone or estradiol).
    - **Diagnosis**: In sporadic cases, diagnosis is often by exclusion. Repetitive GnRH administration restoring normal pituitary gonadotropin responses points to a hypothalamic defect.
    - **Treatment**:
        - **Males**: Long-term treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or testosterone restores pubertal development and secondary sex characteristics.
        - **Females**: Can be treated with cyclic estrogen and progestin.
        - **Fertility**: May be restored by administration of gonadotropins or by using a portable infusion pump to deliver subcutaneous, pulsatile GnRH.
- **Bardet-Biedl Syndrome**:
    - A very rare **genetically heterogeneous disorder**.
    - **Characteristics**: **Intellectual disability, renal abnormalities, obesity, and hexadactyly, brachydactyly, or syndactyly**.
    - Central Diabetes Insipidus (DI) may or may not be associated.
    - **GnRH deficiency** occurs in 75% of males and half of affected females.
    - **Retinal degeneration** begins in early childhood, often leading to blindness by age 30.
    - **Genetics**: Numerous subtypes identified, with genetic linkage to at least nine loci. Several loci encode genes involved in **basal body cilia function**, which may explain the diverse clinical manifestations.
- **Leptin and Leptin Receptor Mutations**:
    - Deficiencies cause a broad spectrum of hypothalamic abnormalities, including **hyperphagia, obesity, and central hypogonadism**.
    - **Mechanism**: Decreased GnRH production results in attenuated pituitary FSH and LH synthesis and release.
- **Prader-Willi Syndrome**:
    - A **contiguous gene syndrome** resulting from deletion of paternal copies of the imprinted SNRPN gene, NECDIN gene, and possibly other genes on chromosome 15q.
    - **Characteristics**: Associated with **hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, hyperphagia-obesity, chronic muscle hypotonia, mental retardation, and adult-onset diabetes mellitus**.
    - **Somatic defects**: Involve the skull, eyes, ears, hands, and feet.
    - **Neuroanatomy**: Diminished hypothalamic oxytocin- and vasopressin-producing nuclei have been reported.
    - **GnRH deficiency**: Suggested by the observation that chronic GnRH treatment restores pituitary LH and FSH release.

### Acquired Hypopituitarism

Hypopituitarism can be caused by accidental or neurosurgical trauma, vascular events (such as apoplexy), pituitary or hypothalamic neoplasms (craniopharyngioma, lymphoma, metastatic tumors), inflammatory disease (such as lymphocytic hypophysitis), autoimmune hypophysitis (associated with checkpoint inhibitor cancer immunotherapy), infiltrative disorders (sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, tuberculosis), or irradiation.

- **Brain Injury**:
    - Patients with brain injury from contact sports trauma, motor vehicle accidents, explosive causes, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and irradiation can experience **transient or long-term hypopituitarism**.
    - **Follow-up**: Long-term periodic endocrine follow-up is indicated because hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction develops in 25–40% of these patients.
- **Hypothalamic Infiltration Disorders**:
    - **Examples**: Sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X, amyloidosis, and hemochromatosis.
    - **Involvement**: Frequently involve both hypothalamic and pituitary neuronal and neurochemical tracts.
    - **Presentation**: **Diabetes Insipidus (DI)** is a common presentation, reported in half of patients.
    - **Other features**: Growth retardation is seen if attenuated GH secretion occurs before puberty. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hyperprolactinemia are also common.
- **Inflammatory Lesions**:
    - Pituitary damage and subsequent secretory dysfunction can occur with chronic site infections (e.g., tuberculosis), opportunistic fungal infections associated with AIDS, and tertiary syphilis.
    - **Other inflammatory processes**: Granulomas and sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of imaging studies suggestive of a pituitary adenoma.
    - These lesions can cause extensive hypothalamic and pituitary damage, leading to hormone deficiencies.
- **Cranial Irradiation**:
    - Can result in **long-term hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction**, especially in children and adolescents, who are more susceptible.
    - **Correlation**: The development of hormonal abnormalities correlates strongly with irradiation dosage and time after radiotherapy.
    - Up to two-thirds of patients ultimately develop hormone insufficiency after a median dose of 50 Gy.
    - **Onset**: Hypopituitarism develops over 5–15 years and usually reflects **hypothalamic damage** rather than primary destruction of pituitary cells.
    - **Hormone Loss Pattern**: Variable, but **GH deficiency is most common**, followed by gonadotropin, thyroid, and ACTH deficiency.
    - **Management**: Anterior pituitary function should be continually evaluated long-term, and replacement therapy instituted as appropriate.
- **Lymphocytic Hypophysitis**:
    - Occurs most often in **postpartum women**.
    - **Presentation**: Usually with **hyperprolactinemia** and MRI evidence of a prominent pituitary mass resembling an adenoma, with mildly elevated PRL levels.
    - **Pituitary Failure**: Can be transient or permanent, requiring immediate evaluation and treatment.
    - **Rare**: Isolated pituitary hormone deficiencies have been described, suggesting a selective autoimmune process.
    - **Symptoms**: Most patients manifest progressive mass effects with headache and visual disturbance. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is often elevated.
    - **Diagnosis**: Should be considered in a postpartum woman with a newly diagnosed pituitary mass before unnecessary surgical intervention, as it can be indistinguishable from a pituitary adenoma on MRI.
    - **Treatment**: The inflammatory process often resolves after several months of **glucocorticoid treatment**, and pituitary function may be restored.
- **Immunotherapy and Hypophysitis**:
    - Pituitary cells express cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4).
    - Up to 20% of patients receiving cancer immunotherapy with **CTLA-4 inhibitors** (e.g., ipilimumab) may develop hypophysitis.
    - **Associated with**: Heterogeneously associated thyroid, adrenal, islet, and gonadal failure.
    - Hypophysitis is also reported with **PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors** (e.g., pembrolizumab and nivolumab) and may show delayed presentation.
    - **Treatment**: Pituitary hormone replacement, with or without high-dose glucocorticoids, may be safely tolerated with continued immunotherapy.
- **Pituitary Apoplexy**:
	- **Description**: Acute intrapituitary hemorrhagic vascular events that can cause substantial damage to the pituitary and surrounding sellar structures.
    - **Occurrence**: May occur spontaneously in a preexisting pituitary adenoma; postpartum (Sheehan’s syndrome); or in association with diabetes, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, or acute shock.
    - **Pregnancy Risk**: The hyperplastic enlargement of the pituitary during pregnancy increases the risk for hemorrhage and infarction.
    - **Emergency**: An **endocrine emergency** that may result in severe hypoglycemia, hypotension and shock, central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage, and death.
    - **Acute Symptoms**: May include **severe headache with signs of meningeal irritation, bilateral visual changes, ophthalmoplegia**, and, in severe cases, cardiovascular collapse and loss of consciousness.
    - **Imaging**: Pituitary CT or MRI may reveal signs of intratumoral or sellar hemorrhage, with pituitary stalk deviation and compression of pituitary tissue.
    - **Management**:
        - Patients with no evident visual loss or impaired consciousness can be observed and managed conservatively with **high-dose glucocorticoids**.
        - Those with significant or progressive visual loss, cranial nerve palsy, or loss of consciousness require **urgent surgical decompression**.
        - **Visual recovery** after sellar surgery is inversely correlated with the length of time after the acute event, making early surgery indicated for severe ophthalmoplegia or visual deficits.
    - **Post-Apoplexy**: Hypopituitarism is common.
- **Empty Sella**:
    - A partial or apparently totally empty sella is often an **incidental MRI finding**.
    - May sometimes be associated with intracranial hypertension.
    - **Function**: Patients usually have normal pituitary function, implying the surrounding rim of pituitary tissue is fully functional.
    - **Hypopituitarism**: May develop insidiously.
    - **Mechanism**: Pituitary adenomas may undergo clinically silent infarction and involution, leading to a partial or totally empty sella by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filling the dural herniation.
    - **Adenomas**: Rarely, small but functional pituitary adenomas may arise within the rim of normal pituitary tissue and are not always visible on MRI.

### Presentation and Diagnosis

The clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism depend on which hormones are lost and the extent of the deficiency.

- **GH deficiency**: Causes growth disorders in children and leads to abnormal body composition in adults.
- **Gonadotropin deficiency**: Causes menstrual disorders and infertility in women, and decreased sexual function, infertility, and loss of secondary sexual characteristics in men.
- **TSH and ACTH deficiencies**: Usually develop later in the course of pituitary failure.
    - **TSH deficiency**: Causes growth retardation in children and features of hypothyroidism in children and adults.
    - **Secondary adrenal insufficiency (due to ACTH deficiency)**: Leads to hypocortisolism with relative preservation of mineralocorticoid production.
- **PRL deficiency**: Causes failure of lactation.
- **Posterior pituitary lesions**: Polyuria and polydipsia reflect loss of vasopressin secretion.
- **Mortality**: Patients with long-standing pituitary damage have an **increased mortality rate**, primarily from increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Previous head or neck irradiation is also a determinant of increased mortality, especially from cerebrovascular disease.

### Laboratory Investigation

Biochemical diagnosis involves demonstrating **low levels of respective pituitary trophic hormones** in the setting of **low levels of target organ hormones**.

- **Examples**:
    - Low free thyroxine with a low or inappropriately normal TSH level suggests secondary hypothyroidism.
    - A low testosterone level without elevation of gonadotropins suggests hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
- **Provocative Tests**: May be required to assess pituitary reserve.
    - **GH Reserve Tests**: Responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia, arginine, glucagon, L-dopa, growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH), or the orally active ghrelin receptor agonist macimorelin can be used.
    - **ACTH Reserve Tests**:
        - Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) administration induces ACTH release.
        - Administration of synthetic ACTH (cosyntropin) evokes adrenal cortisol release as an indirect indicator.
        - **Most reliably assessed** by measuring ACTH and cortisol levels during **insulin-induced hypoglycemia**.
        - **Caution**: This test should be performed cautiously in patients with suspected adrenal insufficiency due to enhanced susceptibility to hypoglycemia and hypotension. It is **contraindicated** in patients with active coronary artery disease or known seizure disorders.

### Treatment

#### Hypopituitarism

**Hormone replacement therapy**, including glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, sex steroids, GH, and vasopressin, is usually **safe and free of complications**. Treatment regimens aim to mimic physiologic hormone production for satisfactory clinical homeostasis. Patients needing glucocorticoid replacement require careful dose adjustments during stressful events.

### Disorders of Growth and Development

#### Skeletal Maturation and Somatic Growth

- The **growth plate** depends on various hormonal stimuli, including GH, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, sex steroids, thyroid hormones, paracrine and circulating growth factors (e.g., fibroblast growth factor family), and cytokines.
- Growth also requires caloric energy, amino acids, vitamins, and trace metals, consuming about 10% of normal energy production.
- **Malnutrition** impairs chondrocyte activity, increases GH resistance, and reduces circulating IGF-1 and IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 levels.
- **Linear bone growth rates** are very high in infancy and are pituitary dependent. Mean growth velocity is about 6 cm/year in later childhood.
- **Peak growth rates** occur during midpuberty (bone age 12 for girls, 13 for boys).
- Secondary sexual development is associated with elevated sex steroids, which cause progressive epiphyseal growth plate closure.
- **Bone age is delayed** in patients with all forms of true GH deficiency or GH receptor defects.
- **Short stature** can result from constitutive intrinsic growth defects or acquired extrinsic factors.
    - **Delayed bone age** in a child with short stature suggests a hormonal or systemic disorder.
    - **Normal bone age** in a short child is more likely caused by a genetic cartilage dysplasia or growth plate disorder.
- **GH Deficiency in Children**:
    - Characterized by **short stature, micropenis, increased fat, high-pitched voice, and a propensity to hypoglycemia**.
    - Familial modes of inheritance are seen in at least one-third of individuals (autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked).
    - About 10% of children with GH deficiency have **mutations in the GH-N gene**.
    - Mutations in transcription factors Pit-1 and Prop-1 result in GH deficiency combined with other pituitary hormone deficiencies, which may manifest only in adulthood.
    - The diagnosis of idiopathic GH deficiency should only be made after known molecular defects are rigorously excluded.
- **GHRH Receptor Mutations**:
    - Recessive mutations of the GHRH receptor gene lead to severe proportionate dwarfism.
    - Associated with **low basal GH levels that cannot be stimulated** by exogenous GHRH, GH-releasing peptide, or insulin-induced hypoglycemia, as well as anterior pituitary hypoplasia.
    - This syndrome highlights the importance of the GHRH receptor for somatotrope cell proliferation and hormonal responsiveness.
- **GH Insensitivity**:
    - Caused by **defects of GH receptor structure or signaling**.
    - **Laron syndrome** is caused by homozygous or heterozygous mutations of the GH receptor, leading to partial or complete GH insensitivity and growth failure.
    - **Diagnosis**: Based on **normal or high GH levels, with decreased circulating GH-binding protein (GHBP), and low IGF-1 levels**.
    - Rarely, defective IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor, or IGF-1 signaling defects are encountered.
    - **STAT5B mutations** result in immunodeficiency and abrogated GH signaling, leading to short stature with normal or elevated GH levels and low IGF-1 levels.
    - Circulating GH receptor antibodies may rarely cause peripheral GH insensitivity.
- **Nutritional Short Stature**:
    - Caloric deprivation and malnutrition, uncontrolled diabetes, and chronic renal failure are secondary causes of abrogated GH receptor function.
    - These conditions also stimulate proinflammatory cytokines, which exacerbate the block of GH-mediated signal transduction.
    - Children typically exhibit features of acquired short stature with normal or elevated GH and low IGF-1 levels.
- **Psychosocial Short Stature**:
    - Emotional and social deprivation lead to growth retardation accompanied by delayed speech, discordant hyperphagia, and an attenuated response to administered GH.
    - A nurturing environment restores growth rates.

#### Presentation and Diagnosis (Short Stature)

- Evaluation is indicated if a patient’s height is **>3 standard deviations below the mean for age** or if the **growth rate has decelerated**.
- **Skeletal maturation** is best evaluated by measuring a **radiologic bone age**, based on the degree of wrist bone growth plate fusion.
- Final height can be predicted using standardized scales (Bayley-Pinneau or Tanner-Whitehouse) or estimated by adding 6.5 cm (boys) or subtracting 6.5 cm (girls) from the midparental height.

#### Laboratory Investigation (Short Stature)

- Because GH secretion is pulsatile, **GH deficiency is best assessed by examining the response to provocative stimuli**, including exercise, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and other pharmacologic tests.
    - These tests normally increase GH to >7 μg/L in children.
    - Random GH measurements do not distinguish normal children from those with true GH deficiency.
- Adequate adrenal and thyroid hormone replacement should be assured before testing.
- **Age-matched IGF-1 levels** are not sufficiently sensitive or specific for diagnosis but can be useful to confirm GH deficiency.
- **Pituitary MRI** may reveal pituitary mass lesions or structural defects.
- Molecular analyses for known mutations should be undertaken when the cause of short stature remains cryptic or suggests a genetic cause.

#### Treatment (Disorders of Growth and Development)

- **Recombinant GH replacement therapy** (0.02–0.05 mg/kg per day SC) restores growth velocity in GH-deficient children to about 10 cm/year.
- If pituitary insufficiency is documented, other associated hormone deficits, especially adrenal steroids, should be corrected.
- GH treatment may be combined with strategies to delay puberty (e.g., GnRH agonist) or reduce sex steroids (e.g., aromatase inhibitors) to mitigate their effect on epiphyseal closure.
- GH treatment is also moderately effective for accelerating growth rates in children with Turner syndrome and chronic renal failure.
- Treating psychosocial or constitutional (idiopathic) short stature with GH is not uniformly recommended due to modest additive growth and cost/side effect profiles.
- In patients with **GH insensitivity** and growth retardation due to GH receptor mutations, **treatment with IGF-1 bypasses the dysfunctional GH receptor**.

### Adult GH Deficiency (AGHD)

- AGHD usually results from **acquired hypothalamic or pituitary somatotrope damage**.
- **Typical pattern of hormone loss**: Adequate GH reserve loss foreshadows subsequent hormone deficits, usually in the order of **GH → FSH/LH → TSH → ACTH**.
- Patients diagnosed with childhood-onset GH deficiency should be retested as adults to affirm the diagnosis.

#### Presentation and Diagnosis (AGHD)

- Clinical features include **changes in body composition, lipid metabolism, quality of life, and cardiovascular dysfunction**.
    - **Body composition changes**: Reduced lean body mass, increased fat mass (selective intraabdominal visceral fat), and increased waist-to-hip ratio.
    - **Cardiovascular issues**: Hyperlipidemia, left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, and increased plasma fibrinogen levels may be present.
    - **Bone health**: Reduced bone mineral content, with resultant increased fracture rates.
    - **Psychosocial impact**: Patients may experience social isolation, depression, and difficulty maintaining gainful employment.
- **Mortality**: Adult hypopituitarism is associated with a **threefold increase in cardiovascular mortality rates**compared to age- and sex-matched controls, possibly due to GH deficiency even with replacement of other hormones.

#### Features of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency

The content of Table 379-4, detailing "Features of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency," is not provided in the source text.

#### Laboratory Investigation (AGHD)

- AGHD is rare, and due to nonspecific symptoms, patients appropriate for testing should be carefully selected based on well-defined criteria.
- **Predisposing factors for testing**:
    1. Pituitary surgery
    2. Pituitary or hypothalamic tumor or granulomas
    3. History of cranial irradiation
    4. Radiologic evidence of a pituitary lesion
    5. Childhood requirement for GH replacement therapy
- **Retesting adolescents** transitioning to adulthood is required to document AGHD. Up to 20% of patients previously treated for childhood-onset GH deficiency are found to be GH sufficient on repeat testing.
- About 25% of truly GH-deficient adults have low-normal IGF-1 levels. Valid age-matched IGF-1 measurements are useful for therapeutic responses but are not precise enough for diagnosis.
- The **most validated diagnostic test**: **Insulin-induced (0.05–0.1 U/kg) hypoglycemia**.
    - After glucose reduction to about 40 mg/dL, most individuals experience neuroglycopenic symptoms. Peak GH release occurs at 60 min and remains elevated for up to 2 hours.
    - About 90% of healthy adults exhibit GH responses >5 μg/L.
    - **AGHD is defined by a peak GH response to hypoglycemia of <3 μg/L**.
    - **Contraindications**: Although generally safe under supervision, it is contraindicated in patients with diabetes, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or epilepsy, and in elderly patients.
- **Alternative stimulatory tests**: Intravenous arginine (30 g), GHRH (1 μg/kg), oral ghrelin receptor agonist (0.5 mg/kg), and glucagon (1 mg). Combinations of these tests may evoke GH secretion in subjects unresponsive to a single test.

#### Treatment (Adult GH Deficiency)

- **Indication**: Once AGHD is unequivocally established.
- **Contraindications**: Active neoplasm, intracranial hypertension, and uncontrolled diabetes and retinopathy.
- **Dosing**:
    - Starting adult dose: 0.1–0.2 mg/d.
    - Titration: Up to a maximum of 1.25 mg/d to maintain **IGF-1 levels in the mid-normal range** for age- and sex-matched controls.
    - **Dosage considerations**: Women require higher doses than men, and elderly patients require less GH.
- **Long-term effects**:
    - **Body composition**: Sustains normal IGF-1 levels and is associated with persistent body composition changes (e.g., enhanced lean body mass and lower body fat).
    - **Lipid metabolism**: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increases, but total cholesterol and insulin levels may not change significantly.
    - **Bone mineral density**: Lumbar spine bone mineral density increases, but this response is gradual (>1 year).
    - **Quality of life**: Many patients note significant improvement when evaluated by standardized questionnaires.
    - **Mortality**: The effect on mortality rates is currently under long-term prospective investigation.
- **Long-acting GH preparations**: Recently approved for AGHD and require weekly injections. Dosing should be titrated to achieve normal but not supra-normal IGF-1 levels. Early reports indicate similar side effects to subcutaneous formulations.
- **Side Effects**:
    - About 30% of patients exhibit **reversible dose-related fluid retention, joint pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome**.
    - Up to 40% exhibit **myalgias and paresthesia**.
    - **Diabetes management**: Patients receiving insulin require careful monitoring for dosing adjustments, as GH is a potent counterregulatory hormone for insulin action. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may initially develop further insulin resistance; however, glycemic control usually improves with sustained loss of abdominal fat associated with long-term GH replacement.
    - **Rare**: Headache, increased intracranial pressure, hypertension, and tinnitus.
    - **Safety**: Pituitary tumor regrowth and progression of skin lesions or other tumors have not been encountered in long-term surveillance programs with appropriate replacement doses.

### ACTH Deficiency

- **Type**: Secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary ACTH deficiency.
- **Characteristics**: Fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and, occasionally, hypoglycemia.
- **Distinction from primary adrenal failure**: In contrast, hypocortisolism associated with pituitary failure is usually **not accompanied by hyperpigmentation or mineralocorticoid deficiency**.
- **Causes**:
    - Most commonly due to **glucocorticoid withdrawal** after treatment-associated suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
    - Isolated ACTH deficiency may occur after surgical resection of an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma that has suppressed the HPA axis, which is suggestive of a surgical cure.
    - The mass effects of other pituitary adenomas or sellar lesions may lead to ACTH deficiency, usually combined with other pituitary hormone deficiencies.
    - **Partial ACTH deficiency** may be unmasked during an acute medical or surgical illness, reflecting diminished ACTH reserve.
    - Rarely, TPIT or POMC mutations result in primary ACTH deficiency.

#### Laboratory Diagnosis (ACTH Deficiency)

- Characterized by **inappropriately low ACTH levels in the setting of low cortisol levels**.
- Low basal serum cortisol levels are associated with blunted cortisol responses to ACTH stimulation and impaired cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia or testing with metyrapone or CRH.

#### Treatment (ACTH Deficiency)

- **Glucocorticoid replacement therapy** improves most features of ACTH deficiency.
- **Hydrocortisone**: Total daily dose preferably should not exceed **20 mg daily**, divided into two or three doses.
- **Prednisone**: 5 mg each morning is longer acting and has fewer mineralocorticoid effects than hydrocortisone.
- Some authorities advocate lower maintenance doses to avoid cushingoid side effects.
- **Stress Dosing**: Doses should be increased severalfold during periods of acute illness or stress.
- **Patient Education**: Patients should wear medical alert bracelets and/or carry identification cards with information about their glucocorticoid requirements.

### Gonadotropin Deficiency

- **Prevalence**: **Hypogonadism is the most common presenting feature of adult hypopituitarism**, even when other pituitary hormones are also deficient.
- **Indicator**: Often a harbinger of hypothalamic or pituitary lesions that impair GnRH production or delivery through the pituitary stalk.
- A common presenting feature of hyperprolactinemia.
- **Causes of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**:
    - Variety of inherited and acquired disorders.
    - **Hypothalamic defects associated with GnRH deficiency**: Include Kallmann syndrome and mutations in over a dozen genes regulating GnRH neuron migration, development, and function.
    - **Pituitary gonadotropin deficiency**: Mutations in GPR54, DAX1, NR5A1, kisspeptin, the GnRH receptor, and the LHβ or FSHβ subunit genes.
    - **Acquired forms of GnRH deficiency**: Seen in association with anorexia nervosa, stress, starvation, and extreme exercise, but also may be idiopathic. These are reversed by removing the stressful stimulus or by caloric replenishment.

#### Presentation and Diagnosis (Gonadotropin Deficiency)

- **Premenopausal women**: Presents as **diminished ovarian function** leading to oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, infertility, decreased vaginal secretions, decreased libido, and breast atrophy.
- **Hypogonadal adult men**: Secondary testicular failure associated with **decreased libido and potency, infertility, decreased muscle mass with weakness, reduced beard and body hair growth, soft testes, and characteristic fine facial wrinkles**.
- **Both untreated hypogonadal women and men**: Osteoporosis occurs.

#### Laboratory Investigation (Gonadotropin Deficiency)

- **Central hypogonadism**: Associated with **low or inappropriately normal serum gonadotropin levels** in the setting of low sex hormone concentrations (testosterone in men, estradiol in women).
- Because gonadotropin secretion is pulsatile, valid assessments may require repeated measurements or pooled serum samples.
- **Men**: Have reduced sperm counts.
- **Intravenous GnRH (100 μg) stimulation test**:
    - Stimulates gonadotropes to secrete LH (peaks within 30 min) and FSH (plateaus during ensuing 60 min).
    - Normal responses vary by menstrual cycle stage, age, and sex. Generally, LH levels increase about threefold, while FSH responses are less pronounced.
    - **Interpretation**:
        - In the setting of gonadotropin deficiency, a **normal gonadotropin response to GnRH indicates intact pituitary gonadotrope function and suggests a hypothalamic abnormality**.
        - An **absent response, however, does not reliably distinguish pituitary from hypothalamic causes** of hypogonadism.
    - For this reason, GnRH testing usually adds little to baseline evaluation except in cases of isolated GnRH deficiency (e.g., Kallmann syndrome).
- **Imaging**: MRI examination of the sellar region and assessment of other pituitary functions are usually indicated.

#### Treatment (Gonadotropin Deficiency)

- **Males**:
    - **Testosterone replacement** is necessary to achieve and maintain normal growth and development of external genitalia, secondary sex characteristics, male sexual behavior, and androgenic anabolic effects (muscle function, bone mass).
    - Can be administered by intramuscular injections (every 1–4 weeks), skin patches, or testosterone gels.
    - **Fertility restoration**: Gonadotropin injections (hCG or human menopausal gonadotropin [hMG]) over 12–18 months.

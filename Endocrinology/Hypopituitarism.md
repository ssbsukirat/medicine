- deficient production of anterior pituitary hormones
- Inherited or acquired (more common in adults)
- Acquired due to local tumour, trauma, autoimmune, inflammatory, vascular
# Developmental causes 
- midline craniofacial defects may cause hypoplastic, aplastic or ectopic pituitary
- Acquired in newborn like birt trauma, cranial hemorrhage, asphyxia, breech delivery
- Transcription factor, growth factor defects like 
    - HESX1 
    - SOX2 
    - SOX3 
    - LHX3 
    - LHX4 
    - OTX 
    - GLI2 
    - PAX6 
    - BMP4 
    - ARNT2 
    - FGF8 
    - FGFR1 
    - SHH 
    - PROKR2 
    - GPR161, IGSF1, PITX2, CHD7 
- May cause abnormal development of eyes, corpus collosum, vertebrae and genital systems
- May have combined DI also 
- PIT1 -- GH, PRL, TSH deficiency leading to growth failure, hypothyroidism 
- PROP-1 -- required early in pituitary development and for PIT1 Function -- GH PRL TSH & gonadotropin deficiency -- may not enter puberty spontaneously
# Hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction
- can affect temperature regulation, Appetite, sleep wake cycle, autonomic systems, behaviour, memory and endocrine systems 
## Kallmann Syndrome
- defective GnRH synthesis
- Anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia 
- Associated with colour blindness, optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, renal dysfunction, cryptorchidism, neurological defects like mirror movements
- Initially X linked gene KAL (impairs neuronal migration from olfactory placode to hypothalamus)

## Anterior Pituitary Gland Overview

- The anterior pituitary, together with the hypothalamus, is often called the **“master gland”** due to its role in orchestrating complex regulatory functions of many other endocrine glands.
- It produces six major hormones:
    - Prolactin (PRL)
    - Growth Hormone (GH)
    - Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)
    - Luteinizing Hormone (LH)
    - Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)
    - Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)
- **Hormone Secretion**: Pituitary hormones are secreted in a **pulsatile manner**, reflecting regulation by specific hypothalamic releasing factors.
- **Trophic Responses**: Each pituitary hormone elicits specific trophic responses in peripheral target tissues, including the adrenal, thyroid, gonads, liver, breast, and bone.
- **Feedback Control**: Hormonal products from peripheral glands exert feedback control on the hypothalamus and pituitary to modulate pituitary function.
- **Clinical Relevance**:
    - Pituitary tumors cause characteristic hormone excess syndromes.
    - Hormone deficiency may be inherited or acquired.
    - Efficacious treatments exist for many pituitary hormone excess and deficiency syndromes.
    - Diagnosis can be elusive, highlighting the importance of recognizing subtle clinical manifestations and performing correct laboratory tests.

## Anatomy and Development

### Anatomy

- **Weight**: The pituitary gland weighs approximately **600 mg**.
- **Location**: Located within the **sella turcica**, ventral to the diaphragma sella.
- **Composition**: Consists of anatomically and functionally distinct **anterior and posterior lobes**.
- **Contiguous Structures**: The bony sella is contiguous with vascular and neurologic structures, including the cavernous sinuses, cranial nerves, and optic chiasm.
- **Pathologic Processes**: Expanding intrasellar pathological processes can cause significant central mass effects in addition to their endocrinological impact.

### Blood Supply and Neural Connections

- **Hypothalamic Hormones**: Hypothalamic neural cells synthesize specific releasing and inhibiting hormones.
- **Portal Vessels**: These hormones are secreted directly into the **portal vessels of the pituitary stalk**.
- **Arterial Supply**: The pituitary gland receives blood from the superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries.
- **Anterior Pituitary Blood Supply**: The **hypothalamic-pituitary portal plexus** provides the major blood source for the anterior pituitary.
    - This system allows for **reliable transmission** of hypothalamic peptide pulses without significant systemic dilution.
    - Anterior pituitary cells are exposed to specific releasing or inhibiting factors, and in turn, release their respective hormones as discrete pulses into the systemic circulation.
- **Posterior Pituitary Blood Supply**: The posterior pituitary is supplied by the inferior hypophyseal arteries.
- **Posterior Pituitary Innervation**: In contrast to the anterior pituitary, the posterior lobe is directly innervated by hypothalamic neurons (supraopticohypophyseal and tuberohypophyseal nerve tracts) via the pituitary stalk.
    - Posterior pituitary production of vasopressin (ADH) and oxytocin is particularly sensitive to neuronal damage affecting the pituitary stalk or hypothalamus.

### Pituitary Development

- **Origin**: Pituitary development from **Rathke’s pouch** involves a complex interplay of lineage-specific transcription factors and locally produced growth factors.
- **Precursor Cells**: Lineage-specific transcription factors are expressed in pluripotent Sox2-expressing precursor cells.
- **Key Transcription Factors**:
    - **Prop-1**: Induces pituitary development of Pit-1-specific lineages and gonadotropes.
    - **Pit-1**: Determines cell-specific expression of **GH, PRL, and TSH** in somatotropes, lactotropes, and thyrotropes.
        - High levels of estrogen receptors in Pit-1-containing cells favor **PRL expression**.
        - Thyrotrope embryonic factor (TEF) induces **TSH expression**.
        - Pit-1 binds to GH, PRL, and TSH gene regulatory elements, providing a mechanism for specific pituitary hormone phenotypic stability.
    - **Steroidogenic Factor (SF-1) and DAX-1**: Define gonadotrope cell development.
    - **T-Pit**: Required for the development of corticotrope cells, which express the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene.
- **Abnormalities**: Inherited mutations of developmental transcription factors, including Pit-1, Prop-1, SF-1, DAX-1, and T-Pit, can cause selective or combined **pituitary hormone deficit syndromes**.

## Anterior Pituitary Hormones

Each anterior pituitary hormone is under unique control and exhibits specific normal and dysregulated secretory characteristics.

### Prolactin (PRL)

#### Synthesis

- **Structure**: Consists of **198 amino acids** and has a molecular mass of 21,500 kDa.
- **Homology**: Weakly homologous to GH and human placental lactogen (hPL), reflecting duplication and divergence of a common GH-PRL-hPL precursor gene.
- **Location**: Synthesized in **lactotropes**, which constitute approximately **20% of anterior pituitary cells**.
- **Precursor Cells**: Lactotropes and somatotropes are derived from a common precursor cell, which may give rise to tumors secreting both PRL and GH.
- **Hyperplasia**: Marked lactotrope cell hyperplasia develops during pregnancy and the first few months of lactation, induced by estrogen to increase PRL production.

#### Secretion

- **Normal Adult Serum Levels**:
    - Women: 10–25 μg/L
    - Men: 10–20 μg/L
- **Pulsatility**: PRL secretion is pulsatile, with the **highest peaks during non-REM sleep** (e.g., 4:00–6:00 A.M., up to 30 μg/L).
- **Half-Life**: Approximately **50 minutes**.
- **Hypothalamic Control**: PRL is unique among pituitary hormones because its predominant hypothalamic control mechanism is **inhibitory**, reflecting tonic **dopamine-mediated suppression** of PRL release.
- **Hypersecretion**: This regulatory pathway accounts for spontaneous PRL hypersecretion following pituitary stalk section, head trauma, or compressive mass lesions at the skull base.
- **Dopamine Receptors**: Pituitary dopamine type 2 (D2) receptors mediate inhibition of PRL synthesis and secretion.
    - Gene knockout of the murine D2 receptor causes hyperprolactinemia and lactotrope proliferation.
    - **Dopamine agonists** play a central role in managing hyperprolactinemic disorders.
- **TRH Effect**: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (a hypothalamic tripeptide) elicits PRL release within 15–30 minutes after intravenous injection, though its physiologic relevance for PRL regulation is unclear (it primarily regulates TSH).
- **Transient Increases**: Serum PRL levels rise transiently after exercise, meals, sexual intercourse, minor surgical procedures, general anesthesia, chest wall injury, acute myocardial infarction, and other forms of acute stress.
- **Pregnancy and Lactation**:
    - Levels increase markedly (about tenfold) during pregnancy and decline rapidly within 2 weeks of parturition.
    - If breast-feeding is initiated, basal PRL levels remain elevated.
    - Suckling stimulates transient reflex increases in PRL levels lasting 30–45 minutes.
    - Breast suckling activates afferent neural pathways in the hypothalamus that induce PRL release.
    - Suckling-induced responses diminish over time, and interfeeding PRL levels return to normal.

#### Action

- **PRL Receptor**: A member of the **type I cytokine receptor family** (which includes GH and IL-6 receptors).
- **Signaling**: Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization and intracellular signaling via **Janus kinase (JAK)**, which stimulates translocation of the signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT) family to activate target genes.
- **Mutations**: Mutations of the PRL receptor cause PRL insensitivity, hyperprolactinemia, and oligomenorrhea. When homozygous, PRL receptor mutations cause **agalactia**, demonstrating that PRL action is necessary for lactation.
- **Breast Development**: In the breast, the lobuloalveolar epithelium proliferates in response to PRL, placental lactogens, estrogen, progesterone, and local paracrine growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1).
- **Primary Functions**: PRL acts to **induce and maintain lactation** and to **suppress both reproductive function and sexual drive**. These functions are geared toward ensuring sustained maternal lactation without interruption by pregnancy.
- **Reproductive Inhibition Mechanism**:
    - Suppresses hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and pituitary gonadotropin secretion.
    - Impairs gonadal steroidogenesis in both women and men.
    - **In the ovary**: Blocks folliculogenesis and inhibits granulosa cell aromatase activity, leading to hypoestrogenism and anovulation. It also has a luteolytic effect, generating a shortened or inadequate luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.
    - **In men**: Attenuated LH secretion leads to low testosterone levels and decreased spermatogenesis.
    - These hormonal changes decrease libido and reduce fertility in patients with hyperprolactinemia.

### Growth Hormone (GH)

#### Synthesis

- **Abundance**: GH is the **most abundant anterior pituitary hormone**.
- **Somatotropes**: GH-secreting somatotrope cells constitute up to **50% of the total anterior pituitary cell population**.
- **Mammosomatotropes**: These cells coexpress PRL with GH and can be identified by double immunostaining techniques.
- **Development/Transcription**: Somatotrope development and GH transcription are determined by the expression of the cell-specific **Pit-1 nuclear transcription factor**.
- **Genes**: Five distinct genes encode GH and related proteins.
    - The pituitary GH gene (hGH-N) produces two alternatively spliced products: **22-kDa GH** (191 amino acids) and a less abundant 20-kDa GH molecule with similar biologic activity.
    - Placental syncytiotrophoblast cells express a GH variant (hGH-V) gene; the related hormone human chorionic somatotropin (HCS) is expressed by distinct members of the gene cluster.

#### Secretion

- **Control**: GH secretion is controlled by complex hypothalamic and peripheral factors.
- **GH-Releasing Hormone (GHRH)**: A 44-amino-acid hypothalamic peptide that stimulates GH synthesis and release.
    - Secreted in **discrete spikes** that elicit GH pulses.
    - The GHRH receptor is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals through the intracellular cyclic AMP pathway to stimulate somatotrope cell proliferation and GH production.
    - **Inactivating mutations of the GHRH receptor cause profound dwarfism**.
- **Ghrelin**: An octanoylated gastric-derived peptide, and synthetic agonists of the GHS-R, induce GHRH and also directly stimulate GH release. A distinct surface receptor for ghrelin is expressed in both the hypothalamus and pituitary.
- **Somatostatin (SRIF)**: Synthesized in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus, it **inhibits GH secretion**.
    - SRIF sets basal GH secretory tone.
    - SRIF is also expressed in many extrahypothalamic tissues (CNS, GI tract, pancreas) where it inhibits islet hormone secretion.
    - Somatostatin binds to five distinct receptor subtypes (SST1 to SST5); SST2 and SST5 subtypes preferentially suppress GH (and TSH) secretion, while SST5 predominantly suppresses ACTH secretion.
- **Feedback Regulation**:
    - **IGF-1** (peripheral target hormone for GH) feeds back to inhibit GH.
    - **Estrogen** induces GH.
    - **Chronic glucocorticoid excess** suppresses GH release, leading to growth delay in children.
- **Pattern**: GH secretion is **pulsatile**, with the **highest peak levels occurring at night**, generally correlating with sleep onset.
- **Age-Related Decline**: GH secretory rates decline markedly with age, so that hormone levels in middle age are approximately **15% of pubertal levels**. These changes parallel an age-related decline in lean muscle mass.
- **Obesity**: GH secretion is reduced in obese individuals, though IGF-1 levels may not be suppressed, suggesting a change in the setpoint for feedback control.
- **Stimuli for Elevation**: Elevated GH levels occur within an hour of deep sleep onset, as well as after exercise, physical stress, and trauma, and during sepsis.
- **Gender Differences**: Integrated 24-hour GH secretion is higher in women and is also enhanced by estrogen replacement, likely reflecting increased peripheral GH resistance.
- **Measurement Challenges**: Using standard assays, random GH measurements are undetectable in approximately 50% of daytime samples from healthy subjects and are also undetectable (<1 μg/L) in most obese and elderly subjects. Thus, **single random GH measurements do not distinguish** patients with adult GH deficiency from those with GH levels in the normal range.
- **Nutritional Influence**: GH secretion is profoundly influenced by nutritional factors.
    - A glucose load suppresses GH to <0.7 μg/L in women and to <0.07 μg/L in men (using ultrasensitive assays with sensitivity of 0.002 μg/L).
    - Increased GH pulse frequency and peak amplitudes occur with chronic malnutrition or prolonged fasting.
- **Pharmacologic/Physiologic Stimulation**: GH is stimulated by oral ghrelin receptor agonists, intravenous L-arginine, dopamine, and apomorphine (a dopamine receptor agonist), as well as by α-adrenergic pathways.
- **Blockade Effect**: β-Adrenergic blockade induces basal GH and enhances GHRH- and insulin-evoked GH release.

#### Action

- **Secretion Pattern Impact**: The pattern of GH secretion may affect tissue responses (e.g., higher GH pulsatility in men vs. relatively continuous basal GH secretion in women may be an important biologic determinant of linear growth patterns and liver enzyme induction).
- **GH Receptor**: The 70-kDa peripheral GH receptor protein has structural homology with the cytokine/hematopoietic superfamily.
    - A fragment of the receptor extracellular domain generates a soluble GH binding protein (GHBP) that binds to circulating GH.
    - The **liver and cartilage express the greatest number of GH receptors**.
    - **Signaling**: GH binding to preformed receptor dimers is followed by internal rotation and subsequent signaling through the **JAK/STAT pathway**. Activated STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they modulate expression of GH-regulated target genes.
- **Antagonists**: GH analogues that bind to the receptor but are incapable of mediating receptor signaling are potent antagonists of GH action. **Pegvisomant**, a GH receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of acromegaly.
- **Metabolic Effects**:
    - Induces protein synthesis and nitrogen retention.
    - **Impairs glucose tolerance by antagonizing insulin action**.
    - Stimulates lipolysis, leading to increased circulating fatty acid levels, reduced omental fat mass, and enhanced lean body mass.
- **Fluid & Electrolyte Balance**: Promotes sodium, potassium, and water retention and elevates serum levels of inorganic phosphate.
- **Bone Growth**: Promotes linear bone growth as a result of complex hormonal and growth factor actions, including those of IGF-1.
    - GH stimulates epiphyseal prechondrocyte differentiation.
    - These precursor cells produce IGF-1 locally, and their proliferation is also responsive to the growth factor.

#### Insulin-Like Growth Factors (IGFs)

- **Mediation of GH Effects**: Although GH exerts direct effects in target tissues, many of its physiologic effects are mediated indirectly through **IGF-1**, a potent growth and differentiation factor.
- **Major Source**: The **liver is the major source of circulating IGF-1**.
- **Local Actions**: In peripheral tissues, IGF-1 also exerts local paracrine actions that appear to be both dependent on and independent of GH.
- **GH and IGF-1 Production**: GH administration induces circulating IGF-1 and stimulates local IGF-1 production in multiple tissues.
- **Binding Proteins (IGFBPs)**: Both IGF-1 and IGF-2 are bound to high-affinity circulating IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that regulate IGF availability and bioactivity.
    - **IGFBP3**: Is GH dependent and serves as the major carrier protein for circulating IGF-1. GH deficiency and malnutrition are usually associated with low IGFBP3 levels.
    - **IGFBP1 and IGFBP2**: Regulate local tissue IGF action but do not bind appreciable amounts of circulating IGF-1.
- **Serum IGF-1 Concentrations**: Profoundly affected by physiologic factors.
    - Increase during puberty and **peak at 16 years**.
    - Decline by >80% during the aging process.
    - Higher in women than in men.
- **Low IGF-1 Causes**: Because GH is the major determinant of hepatic IGF-1 synthesis, abnormalities of GH synthesis or action (including pituitary failure, GHRH receptor defect, GH receptor defect, or pharmacologic GH receptor blockade) lead to reduced IGF-1 levels.
    - Hypocaloric states are associated with GH resistance; thus, IGF-1 levels are low with cachexia, malnutrition, and sepsis.
- **Acromegaly**: IGF-1 levels are invariably high and reflect a log-linear relationship with circulating GH concentrations.

#### IGF-1 Physiology and Side Effects

- **Therapeutic Uses**:
    - Injected IGF-1 (100 μg/kg) induces hypoglycemia.
    - Lower doses improve insulin sensitivity in patients with severe insulin resistance and diabetes.
    - In cachectic subjects, IGF-1 infusion (12 μg/kg per hour) enhances nitrogen retention and lowers cholesterol levels.
    - Longer-term subcutaneous IGF-1 injections enhance protein synthesis and are anabolic.
    - Bone formation markers are induced, and bone turnover may also be stimulated.
    - **IGF-1 is approved for use in patients with GH-resistance syndromes**.
- **Side Effects (Dose-Dependent and Reversible)**: Hypoglycemia, hypotension, fluid retention, temporomandibular jaw pain, and increased intracranial pressure.
- **Reported Damage**: Retinal damage and avascular femoral head necrosis have been reported.
- **Chronic Excess**: Chronic excess IGF-1 administration presumably would result in features of acromegaly.

### Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH)

#### Synthesis

- **Corticotropes**: ACTH-secreting corticotrope cells constitute approximately **20% of the pituitary cell population**.
- **Structure**: ACTH consists of **39 amino acids**.
- **Precursor**: It is derived from the **POMC (proopiomelanocortin) precursor protein** (266 amino acids).
- **Other POMC Products**: POMC also generates several other peptides, including β-lipotropin, β-endorphin, met-enkephalin, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), and corticotropin-like intermediate lobe protein (CLIP).
- **Regulation of POMC Gene**:
    - Potently **suppressed by glucocorticoids**.
    - Induced by **corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)**, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-6), as well as leukemia inhibitory factor.

#### Secretion

- **CRH**: A 41-amino-acid hypothalamic peptide synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus and higher brain centers, CRH is the **predominant stimulator of ACTH synthesis and release**.
    - The CRH receptor is a GPCR expressed on the corticotrope and signals to induce POMC transcription.
- **Pattern**: ACTH secretion is **pulsatile** and exhibits a characteristic **circadian rhythm**.
    - **Peak**: Approximately **6:00 A.M.**.
    - **Nadir**: Approximately **midnight**.
    - This circadian rhythm is determined by variations in secretory pulse amplitude rather than changes in pulse frequency.
    - Adrenal glucocorticoid secretion, driven by ACTH, follows a parallel diurnal pattern.
- **Stimuli for Increase**: Superimposed on this endogenous rhythm, ACTH levels are increased by physical and psychological stress, exercise, acute illness, and insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
- **Negative Feedback (HPA Axis)**: Glucocorticoid-mediated negative regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs due to both hypothalamic CRH suppression and direct attenuation of pituitary POMC gene expression and ACTH release.
    - In contrast, loss of cortisol feedback inhibition, as seen in primary adrenal failure, results in **extremely high ACTH levels**.
- **Inflammatory/Septic Insults**: Acute inflammatory or septic insults activate the HPA axis through the integrated actions of proinflammatory cytokines, bacterial toxins, and neural signals.
    - The cascade of ACTH-inducing cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]; IL-1, -2, and -6; and leukemia inhibitory factor) activates hypothalamic CRH and AVP secretion, pituitary POMC gene expression, and local pituitary paracrine cytokine networks.
    - The resulting cortisol elevation restrains the inflammatory response and enables host protection.
    - Concomitantly, cytokine-mediated central glucocorticoid receptor resistance impairs glucocorticoid suppression of the HPA.
    - The neuroendocrine stress response reflects the net result of highly integrated hypothalamic, intrapituitary, and peripheral hormone and cytokine signals regulating cortisol secretion.

#### Action

- **HPA Axis Function**: The major function of the HPA axis is to **maintain metabolic homeostasis and mediate the neuroendocrine stress response**.
- **Adrenocortical Steroidogenesis**: ACTH induces adrenocortical steroidogenesis by sustaining adrenal cell proliferation and function.
- **ACTH Receptor**: The receptor for ACTH, designated melanocortin-2 receptor, is a GPCR that induces steroidogenesis by stimulating a cascade of steroidogenic enzymes.

### Gonadotropins: FSH and LH

#### Synthesis and Secretion

- **Gonadotropes**: These cells constitute approximately **10% of anterior pituitary cells** and produce two gonadotropin hormones—**LH and FSH**.
- **Structure**: Like TSH and human chorionic gonadotropin, LH and FSH are glycoprotein hormones comprising α and β subunits.
    - The **α subunit is common** to these glycoprotein hormones.
    - Specificity of hormone function is conferred by the **β subunits**, which are expressed by separate genes.
- **Regulation**: Gonadotropin synthesis and release are dynamically regulated, particularly in women, where rapidly fluctuating gonadal steroid levels vary throughout the menstrual cycle.
- **GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)**: A 10-amino-acid hypothalamic peptide, GnRH regulates the synthesis and secretion of both LH and FSH.
    - **Brain kisspeptin**, a product of the KISS1 gene, regulates hypothalamic GnRH release.
    - GnRH is secreted in **discrete pulses every 60–120 minutes**, and these pulses in turn elicit LH and FSH pulses.
    - **Pulsatile mode of GnRH input is essential to its action**; pulses prime gonadotrope responsiveness, whereas continuous GnRH exposure induces desensitization.
    - **Therapeutic Use of GnRH Agonists**: Based on the desensitization phenomenon, long-acting GnRH agonists are used to suppress gonadotropin levels in children with precocious puberty and in men with prostate cancer, and in some ovulation-induction protocols to reduce levels of endogenous gonadotropins.
- **Steroid Feedback**:
    - **Estrogens**: Act at both the hypothalamus and the pituitary to modulate gonadotropin secretion.
        - **Chronic estrogen exposure is inhibitory**.
        - **Rising estrogen levels** (as during the preovulatory surge) exert **positive feedback** to increase gonadotropin pulse frequency and amplitude.
    - **Progesterone**: Slows GnRH pulse frequency but enhances gonadotropin responses to GnRH.
    - **Testosterone (in men)**: Feedback occurs at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels and is mediated in part by its conversion to estrogens.
- **Additional FSH Control**: Although GnRH is the main regulator of LH and FSH secretion, FSH synthesis is also under distinct control by the gonadal peptides **inhibin** and **activin**, members of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family.
    - **Inhibin selectively suppresses FSH**.
    - **Activin stimulates FSH synthesis**.

#### Action

- **Receptor Interaction**: The gonadotropin hormones interact with their respective **GPCRs expressed in the ovary and testis**.
- **Effects**: Evoke germ cell development and maturation and steroid hormone biosynthesis.
- **In Women**:
    - **FSH**: Regulates ovarian follicle development and stimulates ovarian estrogen production.
    - **LH**: Mediates ovulation and maintenance of the corpus luteum.
- **In Men**:
    - **LH**: Induces Leydig cell testosterone synthesis and secretion.
    - **FSH**: Stimulates seminiferous tubule development and regulates spermatogenesis.

### Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)

#### Synthesis and Secretion

- **Thyrotropes**: TSH-secreting thyrotrope cells constitute **5% of the anterior pituitary cell population**.
- **Structure**: TSH shares a common α subunit with LH and FSH but contains a specific **TSH β subunit**.
- **TRH (Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone)**: A hypothalamic tripeptide (pyroglutamyl histidylprolinamide) that acts through a pituitary GPCR to **stimulate TSH synthesis and secretion**. It also stimulates the lactotrope cell to secrete PRL.
- **Regulation**:
    - **Stimulated by**: TRH.
    - **Suppressed by (overriding TRH induction)**: Thyroid hormones, dopamine, somatostatin, and glucocorticoids.
- **Negative Feedback Removal**: Thyrotrope cell proliferation and TSH secretion are both induced when negative feedback inhibition by thyroid hormones is removed.
- **Causes of Increased TSH**: Thyroid damage (including surgical thyroidectomy), radiation-induced hypothyroidism, chronic thyroiditis, and prolonged goitrogen exposure are associated with increased TSH levels.
- **Hypothyroidism Effect**: Long-standing untreated hypothyroidism can lead to elevated TSH levels, which may be associated with thyrotrope hyperplasia and pituitary enlargement, sometimes evident on magnetic resonance imaging.

#### Action

- **Secretion Pattern**: TSH is secreted in pulses, although the excursions are modest compared to other pituitary hormones because of the low amplitude of the pulses and the relatively long half-life of TSH.
- **Measurement**: Consequently, **single determinations of TSH suffice to precisely assess its circulating levels**.
- **Receptor Interaction**: TSH binds to a **GPCR on thyroid follicular cells**.
- **Effect**: Stimulates thyroid hormone synthesis and release.

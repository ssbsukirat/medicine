# Sellar Mass Evaluation

## Local Mass Effects
![[pituitarytumours.png]]

- Clinical manifestations of sellar lesions vary by anatomic location and extension.
- Pituitary adenomas frequently extend in a **suprasellar direction** due to the dorsal sellar diaphragm offering the least resistance to soft tissue expansion.
- **Bony invasion** may occur, especially through the sellar floor to the sphenoid sinus.
- **Headaches** are common even with small intrasellar tumors, due to small changes in intrasellar pressure stretching the dural plate. ==Severity poorly correlates with adenoma size or extension.==
- **Suprasellar extension** can lead to **visual loss**, most commonly by **compression of the optic chiasm**. Rarely, direct invasion of optic nerves or obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow causing secondary visual disturbances can occur.
- **Pituitary stalk compression** by a hormonally active or inactive intrasellar mass may disrupt pituitary access to hypothalamic hormones and dopamine, resulting in early **hyperprolactinemia** and later concurrent loss of other pituitary hormones (stalk section phenomenon). This can also be caused by trauma, whiplash injury, or skull base fractures.
- **Lateral mass invasion** can impinge on the cavernous sinus, compressing neural contents, leading to **cranial nerve III, IV, and VI palsies** and effects on ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Patients may present with **diplopia, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and decreased facial sensation**.
- Extension into the **sphenoid sinus** indicates erosion through the sellar floor.
- Aggressive tumors rarely invade the **palate roof**, causing **nasopharyngeal obstruction, infection, and CSF leakage**.
- **Temporal and frontal lobe involvement** may rarely lead to **uncinate seizures, personality disorders, and anosmia**.
- **Direct hypothalamic encroachment** by an invasive pituitary mass may cause **important metabolic sequelae**, including precocious puberty or hypogonadism, diabetes insipidus, sleep disturbances, dysthermia, and appetite disorders.

## Diagnostic Imaging

- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**:
    - Sagittal and coronal T1-weighted MRI before and after gadolinium allows precise visualization of the pituitary gland and surrounding structures (hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, suprasellar cisterns, cavernous sinuses, sphenoid sinus, optic chiasm).
    - Pituitary gland height ranges from 6 mm in children to 8 mm in adults, potentially reaching 10–12 mm during pregnancy and puberty.
    - The upper aspect of the adult pituitary is flat or slightly concave; in adolescents and pregnant individuals, it may be convex due to physiological enlargement.
    - The stalk should be midline and vertical.
    - Anterior pituitary gland soft tissue consistency is slightly heterogeneous on MRI, and signal intensity resembles brain matter on T1-weighted imaging.
    - Adenoma density is usually lower than normal tissue on T1-weighted imaging, and signal intensity increases with T2-weighted images.
- **Computed Tomography (CT) scan** is reserved to define the extent of bony erosion or the presence of calcification.

## Incidental Findings & Differential Diagnosis

- Sellar masses are commonly encountered as **incidental findings** on MRI, with most being **pituitary adenomas (incidentalomas)**.
- In the absence of hormone hypersecretion, small intrasellar lesions can be **monitored safely with MRI** (annually, then less often if no growth).
- **Resection** should be considered for incidentally discovered **larger macroadenomas**, as about one-third become invasive or cause local pressure effects.
- If **hormone hypersecretion** is identified, specific therapies are indicated.
- Larger masses (>1 cm) should be **distinguished from nonadenomatous lesions**:
    - **Meningiomas** often are associated with bony hyperostosis.
    - **Craniopharyngiomas** may have calcifications and are usually hypodense.
    - **Gliomas** are hyperdense on T2-weighted images.

## Ophthalmologic Evaluation

- **Reproducible visual field assessment** using perimetry techniques should be performed on all patients with sellar mass lesions impinging the optic chiasm.
- **Bitemporal hemianopia** (often more pronounced superiorly) is classically observed, resulting from compression of nasal ganglion cell fibers crossing in the optic chiasm.
- Occasionally, **homonymous hemianopia** occurs from postchiasmal compression, or **monocular temporal field loss** from prechiasmal compression.
- **Invasion of the cavernous sinus** can produce **diplopia** from ocular motor nerve palsy.
- **Early diagnosis reduces the risk** of optic atrophy, vision loss, or eye misalignment.

## Laboratory Investigation

- Laboratory studies are guided by **presenting clinical features of functional pituitary adenomas** (e.g., acromegaly, prolactinoma, Cushing’s disease).
- For a sellar mass with **no obvious clinical features of hormone excess**, studies aim to determine tumor nature and possible hypopituitarism.
- **Initial hormonal evaluation** when a pituitary adenoma is suspected by MRI usually includes:
    1. **Basal prolactin (PRL)**
    2. **Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1**
    3. **24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC)** and/or **overnight oral dexamethasone (1 mg) suppression test**
    4. **α subunit, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH)**
    5. **Thyroid function tests**
- Additional hormonal evaluation may be indicated based on results.
- Pending detailed hypopituitarism assessment, a menstrual history, measurement of testosterone and 8 A.M. cortisol levels, and thyroid function tests usually identify patients needing hormone replacement before further testing or surgery.
- Note: A table titled "Screening Tests for Functional Pituitary Adenomas" exists.

## Histologic Evaluation

- **Immunohistochemical staining** of pituitary tumor specimens from transsphenoidal surgery confirms clinical and laboratory studies.
- Provides a **histologic diagnosis** when hormone studies are equivocal or in cases of clinically nonfunctioning tumors.

# Management of Sellar Masses

## Overview of Treatment

- Successful management requires **accurate diagnosis** and **optimal therapeutic modalities**.
- Most pituitary tumors are **benign and slow growing**.
- Clinical features result from local mass effects and hormonal hyper- or hyposecretion syndromes.
- **Lifelong management and follow-up** are necessary.
- **New advances** in MRI with gadolinium enhancement, transsphenoidal surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy, and novel therapeutic agents have improved management.
- **Goals of pituitary tumor treatment** include:
    - **Normalization of excess pituitary secretion**
    - **Amelioration of symptoms and signs** of hormonal hypersecretion syndromes
    - **Shrinkage or ablation of large tumor masses** with relief of adjacent structure compression
    - **Preservation of residual anterior pituitary function** during treatment, with potential restoration by tumor mass removal
    - **Prevention of adenoma recurrence**

## Transsphenoidal Surgery

- **Desired surgical approach** for pituitary tumors.
- **Exceptions**: Rare invasive suprasellar masses surrounding frontal or middle fossa or optic nerves, or invading posteriorly behind the clivus, may require transcranial approaches.
- **Intraoperative microscopy** facilitates visual distinction between adenomatous and normal pituitary tissue and microdissection of small tumors.
- **Endoscopic techniques** with three-dimensional intraoperative localization enable better visualization and access to tumor tissue.
- Avoids cranial invasion and manipulation of brain tissue required by subfrontal approaches.
- Individual surgical experience is a major determinant of outcome efficacy.
- **Indications**:
    - Correction of hormonal hypersecretion.
    - Mass lesions impinging on surrounding structures.
    - Surgical decompression and resection for **expanding pituitary mass**, which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by persistent headache, progressive visual field defects, cranial nerve palsies, hydrocephalus, and occasionally intrapituitary hemorrhage and apoplexy.
    - Rarely used for pituitary tissue biopsy to establish a histologic diagnosis.
- **Surgical Strategy**:
    - Whenever possible, the pituitary mass lesion should be **selectively excised**.
    - Normal pituitary tissue should be manipulated or resected only when critical for effective mass dissection.
    - **Nonselective hemihypophysectomy or total hypophysectomy** may be indicated if ==no hypersecreting mass lesion is clearly discernible, multifocal lesions are present, or remaining nontumorous pituitary tissue is necrotic.== This increases likelihood of postoperative hypopituitarism and lifelong hormone replacement.
- **Outcomes**:
    - **Preoperative mass effects**, including visual field defects and compromised pituitary function, may be **reversed by surgery**, particularly when deficits are not long-standing.
    - For large and invasive tumors, balancing maximal tumor resection with preservation of anterior pituitary hormonal function (especially growth and reproductive function in younger patients) is necessary.
    - Tumor invasion outside the sella is rarely amenable to surgical cure.
- **Side Effects**:
    - Incidence determined by tumor size, invasiveness, and surgeon experience.
    - Operative mortality rate is **∼1%**.
    - **Transient diabetes insipidus and hypopituitarism** occur in up to 20% of patients.
    - **Permanent diabetes insipidus, cranial nerve damage, nasal septal perforation, or visual disturbances**may be encountered in up to 10% of patients.
    - **CSF leaks** occur in 4% of patients.
    - Less common complications include carotid artery injury, loss of vision, hypothalamic damage, and meningitis.
    - Permanent side effects are **rare after surgery for microadenomas**.

## Radiation Therapy

- Used as **primary therapy** or, more commonly, as an **adjunct to surgery or medical therapy**.
- **Techniques**:
    - **Focused megavoltage irradiation** achieved by precise MRI localization, using a high-voltage linear accelerator and accurate isocentric rotational arcing. Total of <50 Gy (5000 rad) in 180-cGy (180-rad) fractions over ∼6 weeks.
    - **Stereotactic radiosurgery** delivers a large single high-energy dose from a cobalt-60 source (Gamma Knife), linear accelerator, or cyclotron. Long-term effects appear similar to conventional radiation.
    - **Proton beam therapy** provides concentrated radiation doses within a localized region.
- **Role**:
    - Depends on tumor nature, anatomic location, patient age, and availability of expertise.
    - Usually reserved for **postsurgical management** due to its relatively slow onset of action.
    - As an adjuvant, used to treat **residual tumor** to prevent persistent growth or recurrence.
    - Offers the only means for potentially **ablating significant postoperative residual nonfunctioning tumor tissue**.
    - PRL-, growth hormone (GH)–, adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)–, and thyrotropin (TSH)–secreting residual tumor tissues are amenable to **medical therapy**.
- **Side Effects**:
    - **Short-term**: transient nausea and weakness.
    - **Long-lasting**: alopecia and loss of taste and smell.
    - **Failure of pituitary hormone synthesis** is common (>50% of patients develop loss of GH, ACTH, TSH, and/or gonadotropin secretion within 10 years, usually due to hypothalamic damage).
    - **Lifelong follow-up with testing of anterior pituitary hormone reserve** is required.
    - **Optic nerve damage** with impaired vision due to optic neuritis reported in ∼2% of patients.
    - **Cranial nerve damage** is uncommon with doses <2 Gy (200 rad) per session and maximum <50 Gy (5000 rad). Stereotactic radiotherapy reduces risk to adjacent structures.
    - Conventional radiotherapy associated with **adverse mortality rates**, mainly from cerebrovascular disease.
    - **Cumulative risk of developing a secondary tumor** is 1.3% after 10 years and 1.9% after 20 years.

## Medical Therapy

- Highly **specific** and depends on tumor type.
- **Prolactinomas**: **dopamine agonists** are the treatment of choice.
- **Acromegaly**: **somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs)** and a **GH receptor antagonist** are indicated.
- **TSH-secreting tumors**: **SRLs** and occasionally **dopamine agonists**.
- **ACTH-secreting tumors**: may respond to **SRLs**, and adrenal-directed therapy may also benefit.
- **Nonfunctioning tumors**: generally **not responsive to medications** and require surgery and/or irradiation.

# Differential Diagnosis of Sellar Masses

## Origins and Imaging Characteristics

- Sellar masses may arise from **brain, hypothalamic, or pituitary tissues**.
- Each exhibit features related to lesion location but also unique to specific etiology.
- Unique MRI characteristics inform the differential diagnosis.

## Hypothalamic Lesions and Their Effects

- **Anterior and preoptic hypothalamic regions**: paradoxical vasoconstriction, tachycardia, hyperthermia. Acute hyperthermia usually due to hemorrhagic insult; poikilothermia may also occur.
- **Posterior hypothalamic damage**: central disorders of thermoregulation.
- **Periodic hypothermia syndrome**: episodic attacks of rectal temperatures <30°C (86°F), sweating, vasodilation, vomiting, and bradycardia.
- **Damage to ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei** (by craniopharyngiomas, trauma, inflammatory disorders): associated with hyperphagia and obesity. This region may contain an energy-satiety center influenced by leptin, insulin, POMC products, and GI peptides.
- **Preoptic nuclei damage**: polydipsia and hypodipsia.
- **Slow-growing hypothalamic lesions**: increased somnolence and disturbed sleep cycles, obesity, hypothermia, and emotional outbursts.
- **Central hypothalamus lesions**: may stimulate sympathetic neurons, leading to elevated serum catecholamine and cortisol levels. Predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and gastric erosions.

## Craniopharyngiomas

- **Benign, suprasellar cystic masses** derived from Rathke’s pouch.
- Arise near the pituitary stalk, commonly extending into the suprasellar cistern.
- Often **large, cystic, and locally invasive**. Many are partially calcified, exhibiting a characteristic appearance on skull x-ray and CT images.
- **Presentation**:
    - More than half present **before age 20**.
    - Usually with signs of **increased intracranial pressure** (headache, vomiting, papilledema, hydrocephalus).
    - Associated symptoms: **visual field abnormalities, personality changes, cognitive deterioration, cranial nerve damage, sleep difficulties, and weight gain** accompanied by features of the metabolic syndrome.
    - **Hypopituitarism** documented in ∼90%.
    - **Diabetes insipidus** in ∼10%.
    - About half of affected children present with **growth retardation**.
- **Imaging**:
    - **MRI** generally superior to CT for evaluating cystic structure and tissue components.
    - **CT** useful to define calcifications and evaluate invasion into bony structures and sinuses.
- **Treatment**:
    - Usually involves **transcranial or transsphenoidal surgical resection** followed by **postoperative radiation of residual tumor**.
    - **Surgery alone** is curative in **less than half** due to recurrences (adherence to vital structures, small tumor deposits).
    - Goal of surgery is **maximal tumor removal without risking complications** from adherent/inaccessible tissue.
    - Without radiotherapy, ∼75% recur; 10-year survival <50%.
    - **Radiotherapy improves 10-year survival to 70–90%** but increases risk of secondary malignancies.
    - Most patients require **lifelong pituitary hormone replacement**.
    - Some (particularly papillary) associated with activated **BRAF V600E mutations**; BRAF inhibitors (dabrafenib, vemurafenib) alone or with MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib) resulted in long-term growth responses.

## Rathke's Cysts and Arachnoid Cysts

- **Rathke’s cysts**:
    - Result from **developmental failure of Rathke’s pouch obliteration**.
    - Small (<5 mm), entrapped by squamous epithelium, found in ∼20% of individuals at autopsy.
    - Do not usually grow and often diagnosed incidentally.
    - About a third present in adulthood with **compressive symptoms, diabetes insipidus, and hyperprolactinemia** (due to stalk compression). Rarely, hydrocephalus develops.
    - Diagnosis suggested preoperatively by **visualizing the cyst wall on MRI**, distinguishing from craniopharyngiomas.
    - Cyst contents range from CSF-like fluid to mucoid material.
- **Arachnoid cysts**: Rare, generate an MRI image that is isointense with CSF.

## Other Sellar Mass Lesions

- **Sella chordomas**: Usually present with **bony clival erosion, local invasiveness, and occasional calcification**. Normal pituitary tissue may be visible on MRI, distinguishing them from aggressive pituitary adenomas. Mucinous material may be obtained by fine-needle aspiration.
- **Meningiomas**: Arising in the sellar region, may be difficult to distinguish from nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Typically **enhance on MRI** and may show evidence of calcification or bony erosion. May cause compressive symptoms.
- **Histiocytosis X**: Includes syndromes with **eosinophilic granulomas**. Associated with diabetes insipidus, exophthalmos, punched-out lytic bone lesions (Hand-Schüller-Christian disease), granulomatous lesions visible on MRI, and a characteristic axillary skin rash. Rarely, the pituitary stalk may be involved.
- **Pituitary metastases**: Occur in ∼3% of cancer patients.
    - Bloodborne metastatic deposits found almost exclusively in the **posterior pituitary**.
    - **Diabetes insipidus** can be a presenting feature of lung, gastrointestinal, breast, and other pituitary metastases.
    - About half originate from breast cancer.
    - Rarely, pituitary stalk involvement results in anterior pituitary insufficiency.
    - MRI diagnosis difficult to distinguish from aggressive pituitary adenoma; may require histologic examination.
- **Primary or metastatic lymphoma, leukemias, and plasmacytomas** also occur within the sella.
- **Hypothalamic hamartomas and gangliocytomas**:
    - May arise from astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons.
    - May overexpress hypothalamic neuropeptides (GnRH, GHRH, CRH).
    - **GnRH-producing tumors**: children present with precocious puberty, psychomotor delay, and laughing-associated seizures. Medical treatment with long-acting GnRH analogues effectively suppresses gonadotropin secretion.
    - Rarely associated with craniofacial abnormalities, imperforate anus, cardiac, renal, and lung disorders, and pituitary failure as features of **Pallister-Hall syndrome** (caused by GLI3 gene mutations).
    - Often contiguous with the pituitary; preoperative MRI diagnosis may not be possible. Histologic evidence of hypothalamic neurons in resected tissue may be the first indication.
- **Hypothalamic gliomas and optic gliomas**: Mainly occur in childhood, usually present with visual loss. Adults have more aggressive tumors; about a third associated with neurofibromatosis.
- **Brain germ cell tumors**: May arise within the sellar region.
    - **Dysgerminomas**: frequently associated with diabetes insipidus and visual loss. Rarely metastasize.
    - **Germinomas, embryonal carcinomas, teratomas, and choriocarcinomas**: may arise in the parasellar region and produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Present with precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, visual field defects, and thirst disorders. Many patients are GH deficient with short stature.

# Pituitary Adenomas and Hypersecretion Syndromes

## Overview

- Most common cause of pituitary hormone hypersecretion and hyposecretion syndromes in adults.
- Account for ∼15% of all intracranial neoplasms.
- Population prevalence of ∼80/100,000.
- At autopsy, up to one-quarter of all pituitary glands harbor an unsuspected microadenoma (<10 mm diameter).
- Pituitary imaging detects small clinically inapparent lesions in at least 10% of individuals.
- ![[pitadenomatypes.png]]

## Pathogenesis

- Benign neoplasms arising from one of the **five anterior pituitary cell types**.
- Clinical and biochemical phenotypes depend on the cell type of origin.
- Tumors from lactotrope (PRL), somatotrope (GH), corticotrope (ACTH), thyrotrope (TSH), or gonadotrope (LH, FSH) cells hypersecrete respective hormones.
- **Plurihormonal tumors** express combinations of GH, PRL, TSH, ACTH, or glycoprotein hormone α or β subunits. Diagnosed by immunocytochemistry or manifest as combined clinical syndromes. May arise from single polysecreting cell type or mixed function cells.
- **Hormonally active tumors**: autonomous hormone secretion with diminished feedback responsiveness.
- **Hormone production does not always correlate with tumor size**. Small tumors can cause significant clinical perturbations, while larger ones may be silent.
- About one-third of all adenomas are **clinically nonfunctioning** and produce no distinct clinical hypersecretory syndrome. Most originate from gonadotrope cells and may secrete small amounts of α- and β-glycoprotein hormone subunits.
- **True pituitary carcinomas** with documented extracranial metastases are exceedingly rare.
- Almost all pituitary adenomas are **monoclonal in origin**, implying somatic mutations.
- Complete surgical resection of small pituitary adenomas usually cures hormone hypersecretion.
- **Hypothalamic hormones** (GHRH, CRH) enhance mitotic activity of target pituitary cells. Rare abdominal or chest tumors elaborating ectopic GHRH or CRH can cause somatotrope or corticotrope hyperplasia.

## Genetic Events and Tumorigenesis

- **Sporadic Acromegaly Model**:
    - GHRH uses **cyclic AMP** as a second messenger to stimulate GH secretion and somatotrope proliferation.
    - A subset (∼35%) of GH-secreting pituitary tumors have sporadic **mutations in Gsα**. These mutations attenuate intrinsic GTPase activity, leading to constitutive elevation of cyclic AMP, Pit-1 induction, and activation of CREB, promoting somatotrope cell proliferation and GH secretion.
- **Growth factors** may promote proliferation: basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulates mitogenesis, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling induces hormone synthesis and proliferation.
- **USP8 mutations** may result in overexpressed EGFR in some ACTH-secreting tumors.
- Other factors: **loss of negative-feedback inhibition** (e.g., primary hypothyroidism, hypogonadism) and **estrogen-mediated or paracrine angiogenesis**.
- Growth and neoplastic behavior influenced by activated oncogenes (RAS, pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG)) or inactivation of growth suppressor genes (MEG3).
- Adenomas exhibit **lineage-specific features of cell-cycle disruption**, cellular senescence, chromosomal instability, copy number alterations, and elevated CDK inhibitors, underlying their benign nature.

## Genetic Syndromes

- Note: A table titled "Familial Pituitary Tumor Syndromes" exists.
- **Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1**:
    - Autosomal dominant syndrome.
    - Predisposition to **parathyroid, pancreatic islet, and pituitary adenomas**.
    - Caused by inactivating germline mutations in **MENIN** (tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome 11q13).
    - Loss of heterozygosity or somatic mutation of the remaining normal MENIN allele leads to tumorigenesis.
    - About half develop **prolactinomas**; acromegaly and Cushing’s disease are less common.
- **Carney complex**:
    - Characterized by **spotty skin pigmentation, myxomas, and endocrine tumors** (testicular, adrenal, pituitary adenomas).
    - **Acromegaly** occurs in ∼20% of these patients.
    - A subset has mutations in the **R1α regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PRKAR1A)**.
- **McCune-Albright syndrome**:
    - Consists of **polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, pigmented skin patches, and various endocrine disorders**(acromegaly, adrenal adenomas, autonomous ovarian function).
    - Hormonal hypersecretion results from **constitutive cyclic AMP production** caused by inactivation of Gsα GTPase activity.
    - Gsα mutations occur postzygotically, leading to a mosaic pattern of mutant expression.
- **Familial acromegaly**:
    - Rare disorder where family members may manifest acromegaly or gigantism.
    - A subset has germline mutations in the **AIP gene** (encodes aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein).

# Hyperprolactinemia

## Presentation and Diagnosis

- **In women**:
    - **Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility** are hallmarks.
    - If hyperprolactinemia develops before menarche, **primary amenorrhea** results.
    - More commonly, it leads to **oligomenorrhea** and ultimately **amenorrhea**.
    - Sustained hyperprolactinemia, especially with pronounced hypoestrogenemia, can reduce **vertebral bone mineral density**.
    - **Galactorrhea** present in up to 80%; usually bilateral and spontaneous, but can be unilateral or manually expressed.
    - May also complain of decreased libido, weight gain, and mild hirsutism.
- **In men**:
    - **Diminished libido, infertility, and visual loss** (from optic nerve compression) are usual presenting symptoms.
    - Gonadotropin suppression leads to **reduced testosterone, impotence, and oligospermia**.
    - True galactorrhea is uncommon.
    - Long-standing disorder leads to secondary effects of hypogonadism, including **osteopenia, reduced muscle mass, and decreased beard growth**.
- Diagnosis of **idiopathic hyperprolactinemia** is made by exclusion of known causes in the setting of a normal pituitary MRI. Some may harbor small microadenomas below MRI sensitivity (∼2 mm).

## Galactorrhea

- **Inappropriate discharge of milk-containing fluid from the breast**.
- Considered abnormal if it persists longer than 6 months after childbirth or discontinuation of breast-feeding.
- Postpartum galactorrhea with amenorrhea is self-limiting, usually with moderately elevated PRL.
- May occur spontaneously or be elicited by nipple pressure.
- Can vary in color and consistency (transparent, milky, or bloody) and arise unilaterally or bilaterally.
- **Mammography or ultrasound** indicated for bloody discharges (particularly from a single nipple), which may be caused by breast cancer.
- Commonly associated with **hyperprolactinemia**.
- **Acromegaly** is associated with galactorrhea in about one-third of patients.
- **Treatment** usually involves managing the underlying disorder (e.g., replacing T4 for hypothyroidism, discontinuing medication, treating prolactinoma).

## Laboratory Investigation

- Basal, fasting morning **PRL levels** (normally <20 μg/L) should be measured.
- **False-positive and false-negative results** may occur:
    - Markedly elevated PRL levels (>1000 μg/L) may be falsely lowered by assay artifacts; **sample dilution is required** for accurate measurement.
    - Falsely elevated values may be caused by **aggregated forms of circulating PRL (macroprolactinemia)**, which are usually biologically inactive.
- **Hypothyroidism** should be excluded by measuring TSH and T4 levels.

## Treatment (for Hyperprolactinemia)

- Aimed at **normalizing PRL levels** to alleviate suppressive effects on gonadal function, halt galactorrhea, and preserve bone mineral density.
- **Dopamine agonists** are effective for most causes, regardless of underlying cause.
- If caused by **medication**, the drug should be withdrawn if possible. For psychiatric patients on neuroleptic agents, supervised dose titration or adding a dopamine agonist can restore normoprolactinemia. Dopamine agonists may worsen underlying psychiatric conditions at high doses.
- Hyperprolactinemia usually resolves after **adequate thyroid hormone replacement** in hypothyroid patients or after **renal transplantation** in dialysis patients.
- **Resection of hypothalamic or sellar mass lesions** can reverse hyperprolactinemia caused by stalk compression.
- **Granulomatous infiltrates** occasionally respond to glucocorticoid administration.
- No treatment may be warranted for irreversible hypothalamic damage.
- In up to 30% of patients (usually without a visible pituitary microadenoma), the condition may **resolve spontaneously**.

# Prolactinoma

## Etiology and Prevalence

- Tumors arising from **lactotrope cells** account for about **half of all functioning pituitary tumors**.
- Population prevalence: ∼10/100,000 in men, ∼30/100,000 in women.
- **Mixed tumors** secreting combinations of GH and PRL, ACTH and PRL, and rarely TSH and PRL are also seen. Usually recognized by immunohistochemistry, sometimes without clinical manifestations from additional hormones.
- **Microadenomas** are <1 cm in diameter and usually do not invade the parasellar region.
- **Macroadenomas** are >1 cm in diameter and may be locally invasive and impinge on adjacent structures.
- **Female-to-male ratio for microprolactinomas is 20:1**; for macroadenomas, it is near 1:1.
- Tumor size generally **correlates directly with PRL concentrations**; values **>250 μg/L usually associated with macroadenomas**.
- Men tend to present with larger tumors than women, possibly because male hypogonadism features are less readily evident.
- PRL levels remain stable in most patients, reflecting slow tumor growth.
- About **5% of microadenomas progress to macroadenomas** long-term.

## Presentation and Diagnosis

- **Women**: Usually present with **amenorrhea, infertility, and galactorrhea**. If tumor extends outside the sella, visual field defects or other mass effects may be seen.
- **Men**: Often present with **impotence, loss of libido, infertility, or signs of CNS compression** (headaches, visual defects).
- Diagnosis of prolactinoma is **likely with a PRL level >200 μg/L** (excluding physiological/medication-induced causes).
- PRL levels <100 μg/L may be caused by microadenomas, other sellar lesions decreasing dopamine inhibition, or nonneoplastic causes.
- **MRI should be performed in all patients with hyperprolactinemia**.
- PRL suppression by dopamine agonists does not necessarily indicate the underlying lesion is a prolactinoma, as secondary hyperprolactinemia from nonlactotrope mass effects is also corrected.

## Treatment (for Prolactinoma)

- **Microadenomas**: If asymptomatic and fertility not desired, no treatment may be needed; monitor with regular serial PRL measurements and MRI scans.
- **Symptomatic microadenomas**: Therapeutic goals include **control of hyperprolactinemia, reduction of tumor size, restoration of menses and fertility, and resolution of galactorrhea**.
- Dopamine agonist doses should be titrated for maximal PRL suppression and reproductive function restoration. A normalized PRL level does not ensure reduced tumor size, but tumor shrinkage usually occurs only in responders.
- **Macroadenomas**: Formal **visual field testing** should be performed before initiating dopamine agonists. MRI and visual fields assessed at 6- to 12-month intervals until mass shrinks, then annually.

### Dopamine Agonists

- **Mainstay of therapy** for micro- or macroprolactinomas.
- Suppress PRL secretion and synthesis, and lactotrope cell proliferation.
- May be withdrawn after 2 years in microadenoma patients who achieve normoprolactinemia and significant tumor reduction. Patients should be ==monitored for recurrence (∼20% recurrence, especially males).==
- **Cabergoline**:
    - Ergoline derivative, **long-acting dopamine agonist with high D2 receptor affinity**.
    - Effectively suppresses PRL for >14 days after a single oral dose and induces prolactinoma shrinkage in most patients.
    - Dosage: **0.5–1.0 mg twice weekly**.
    - Achieves normoprolactinemia and normal gonadal function in ∼80% of microadenoma patients; galactorrhea improves or resolves in 90%.
    - Normalizes PRL and shrinks ∼70% of macroprolactinomas.
    - **Mass effect symptoms (headaches, visual disorders) usually improve dramatically within days**. Sexual function improvement takes weeks.
    - MRI should be repeated within 16 weeks after initial therapy for macroadenomas.
    - Reduce to lowest effective maintenance dose after initial control.
    - Hyperprolactinemia may resolve and not recur in ∼5% of microadenoma patients after discontinuation of long-term treatment.
    - May be effective in patients resistant to bromocriptine.
    - Fewer adverse effects and better drug tolerance than bromocriptine.
- **Bromocriptine**:
    - Ergot alkaloid, dopamine receptor agonist that suppresses PRL secretion.
    - **Short-acting**, preferred when **pregnancy is desired**.
    - Initiated at low dose (0.625–1.25 mg) at bedtime, gradually increasing. Most controlled with <7.5 mg daily (2.5 mg tid).
- **Side Effects of Dopamine Agonists**:
    - **Common**: constipation, nasal stuffiness, dry mouth, nightmares, insomnia, vertigo (dose reduction usually helps).
    - **Initial dose effects (∼25% of patients)**: nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension with faintness (may persist).
    - Cabergoline generally has fewer side effects; better tolerated for bromocriptine-intolerant patients.
    - **Intravaginal administration of bromocriptine** often efficacious for intractable GI side effects.
    - **Rare**: auditory hallucinations, delusions, mood swings (up to 5%), leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pleural fibrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, hepatitis.
    - High-dose cabergoline (≥3 mg daily for Parkinson's) associated with **cardiac valve regurgitation**. Studies in prolactinoma patients at recommended doses (up to 2 mg weekly) show no increased incidence of valvular disorders. **Echocardiograms are prudent** before initiating standard-dose cabergoline.

### Surgery (for Prolactinoma)

- **Rarely indicated** for dopamine resistance or intolerance, or invasive macroadenoma with compromised vision that fails to improve after drug treatment.
- **Initial PRL normalization**: ∼70% for microprolactinomas, but only 30% for macroadenomas.
- **Recurrence**: Up to 20% within the first year after surgery; long-term rates may exceed 50% for macroadenomas.

### Radiotherapy (for Prolactinoma)

- Reserved for patients with **aggressive tumors** that do not respond to maximally tolerated dopamine agonists and/or surgery.

## Pregnancy and Prolactinoma

- Pituitary increases in size during pregnancy due to estrogen and other growth factors on vascularity and lactotrope cell hyperplasia.
- About **5% of microadenomas significantly increase in size**, but **15–30% of macroadenomas grow** during pregnancy.
- **Bromocriptine** has been used for >30 years to restore fertility without evidence of teratogenic effects.
- **Strategies to minimize fetal exposure**: Mechanical contraception through three regular menstrual cycles.
- **Discontinue bromocriptine when pregnancy is confirmed**; follow PRL levels serially, especially if headaches or visual symptoms occur.
- For **macroadenomas**, regular visual field testing is recommended; reinstitute drug if tumor growth is apparent.
- Pituitary MRI may be safe during pregnancy but should be reserved for symptomatic patients with severe headache and/or visual field defects.
- **Surgical decompression** may be indicated if vision is threatened.
- **Cabergoline is not recommended for use in women when fertility is desired** due to its long-acting nature and high D2-receptor affinity.

# Acromegaly

## Etiology

- **GH hypersecretion** usually results from a **somatotrope adenoma**.
- Rarely caused by extrapituitary lesions.
- Note: A table titled "Causes of Acromegaly" exists.

## Presentation and Diagnosis

- Manifestations of GH and IGF-1 hypersecretion are **indolent** and often **not clinically diagnosed for 10 years or more**.
- **Acral bony overgrowth**: frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, mandibular enlargement with prognathism, widened space between lower incisor teeth.
- In children and adolescents, **pituitary gigantism** develops if GH hypersecretion initiates before epiphyseal long bone closure.
- **Soft tissue swelling**: increased heel pad thickness, increased shoe or glove size, ring tightening, coarse facial features, large fleshy nose.
- Other common features: **hyperhidrosis, deep/hollow voice, oily skin, arthropathy, kyphosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, proximal muscle weakness and fatigue, acanthosis nigricans, skin tags**.
- **Generalized visceromegaly**: cardiomegaly, macroglossia, thyroid gland enlargement.
- **Most significant clinical impact on cardiovascular system**: cardiomyopathy (arrhythmias, left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased diastolic function), hypertension (ultimately in most untreated patients).
- **Upper airway obstruction with sleep apnea** (>60% of patients), associated with soft tissue laryngeal obstruction and central sleep dysfunction.
- **Diabetes mellitus** in 25%, most are glucose intolerant (GH counteracts insulin).
- Increased risk of **colon polyps and mortality from colonic malignancy** (polyps in up to one-third).
- Overall mortality increased **about threefold**, primarily due to cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory disease.
- Unless GH levels are controlled, survival is reduced by an average of 10 years.

## Laboratory Investigation (for Acromegaly)

- Age-matched serum **IGF-1 levels are elevated**; useful as a laboratory screening measure.
- Measurement of a single random GH level is **not useful** for diagnosis or exclusion due to pulsatility.
- Diagnosis confirmed by demonstrating **failure of GH suppression to <0.4 μg/L** (or <0.05 μg/L with ultrasensitive assays) within 1–2 hours of an oral glucose load (75 g).
- About 20% of patients exhibit a **paradoxical GH rise after glucose**.
- **PRL should be measured**, as it is elevated in ∼25% of patients.
- Thyroid function, gonadotropins, and sex steroids may be attenuated due to tumor mass effects.
- Tests of ACTH reserve in asymptomatic patients are often deferred until after surgery due to glucocorticoid coverage needed for surgery.

## Treatment (for Acromegaly)

- **Goals**: control GH and IGF-1 hypersecretion, ablate or arrest tumor growth, ameliorate comorbidities, restore mortality rates to normal, and preserve pituitary function.
- **Surgical resection** of GH-secreting adenomas is the **initial treatment for most patients**.
- **SRLs** are used as adjuvant treatment for preoperative shrinkage of large invasive macroadenomas, immediate symptom relief, GH hypersecretion reduction, in frail patients, or when surgery fails.
- **Irradiation or repeat surgery** may be required for patients intolerant of or unresponsive to adjunctive medical therapy.
    - Main disadvantages of radiotherapy: **high rate of late hypopituitarism** and **slow rate of biochemical response (5–15 years)**. Relatively ineffective in normalizing IGF-1.
    - Stereotactic ablation (Gamma Knife) is promising, but long-term results and side effects appear similar to conventional radiation.
    - SRLs may be needed while awaiting full benefits of radiotherapy.
- Systemic comorbid sequelae (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis) should be managed aggressively. Mandibular surgical repair may be indicated.

### Surgery (for Acromegaly)

- **Transsphenoidal surgical resection** by an experienced surgeon is the preferred primary treatment.
- **Remission rates**: **∼70% for microadenomas**, **<50% for macroadenomas**.
- **Soft tissue swelling improves immediately** after tumor resection.
- GH levels return to normal within an hour; IGF-1 levels normalize within 3–4 days.
- **Recurrence**: ∼10% of patients may have recurrence several years after apparently successful surgery.
- **Hypopituitarism**: develops in up to 15% of patients after surgery.

### Somatostatin Receptor Ligands (SRLs)

- Exert therapeutic effects through **SST2 and SST5 receptor subtypes** (expressed by GH-secreting tumors).
- **Preferred medical treatments**: long-acting injectable SRL depot formulations of **octreotide and lanreotide**, and oral octreotide capsules.
- Normalize GH and IGF-1 levels in **∼50% of patients**.
- **Octreotide acetate**:
    - Eight-amino-acid synthetic somatostatin analogue, relatively resistant to plasma degradation.
    - 2-h serum half-life; 40-fold greater potency than native somatostatin to suppress GH.
    - **Octreotide LAR**: sustained-release, long-acting formulation. GH suppression for up to 6 weeks after 30-mg intramuscular injection. Long-term monthly treatment sustains GH and IGF-1 suppression and reduces pituitary tumor size in ∼50% of patients.
- **Lanreotide**:
    - Slow-release depot SRL preparation, cyclic somatostatin octapeptide analogue.
    - Suppresses GH and IGF-1 hypersecretion after 60-mg subcutaneous injection.
    - Long-term (every 4–6 weeks) administration controls GH hypersecretion in about two-thirds of treated patients and improves compliance.
- **Oral octreotide capsules (40–80 mg daily)**: maintain biochemical control in patients previously on injectable formulations.
- **Pasireotide LAR**: multireceptor ligand with preferential SST5 binding. Shown efficacy in patients resistant to octreotide or lanreotide.
- **Symptomatic Improvement**:
    - Rapid relief of headache and soft tissue swelling occurs in ∼75% of patients within days to weeks.
    - Most patients report improvement in perspiration, obstructive apnea, and cardiac failure.
- **Side Effects**:
    - Well tolerated in most patients; similar for injectable octreotide, lanreotide, and oral octreotide.
    - Short-lived and mainly related to drug-induced suppression of gastrointestinal motility and secretion.
    - **Transient nausea, abdominal discomfort, fat malabsorption, diarrhea, and flatulence** occur in one-third (usually remit within 2 weeks).
    - **Gallbladder contractility and emptying attenuated**; up to 30% develop long-term echogenic sludge or asymptomatic cholesterol gallstones.
    - Other effects: mild glucose intolerance (due to transient insulin suppression), asymptomatic bradycardia, hypothyroxinemia, local injection site discomfort.
    - **Pasireotide**: associated with similar GI side effects but higher prevalence of glucose intolerance and new-onset diabetes mellitus.

### GH Receptor Antagonist (Pegvisomant)

- **Pegvisomant**: antagonizes endogenous GH action by **blocking peripheral GH binding to its receptor**.
- Suppresses serum **IGF-1 levels**, reducing deleterious effects of excess endogenous GH.
- Administered by **daily subcutaneous injection (10–30 mg)**.
- Normalizes IGF-1 in **∼70% of patients**.
- **GH levels remain elevated** as the drug does not target the pituitary adenoma.
- **Side effects**: reversible liver enzyme elevation, lipodystrophy, injection site pain.
- Tumor size should be monitored by MRI.

### Combined Medical Therapy

- Combined treatment with **monthly SRLs and weekly or biweekly pegvisomant injections** has been used effectively in resistant patients.

### Dopamine Agonists (for Acromegaly)

- Very high doses of **cabergoline (0.5 mg/d)** may achieve short-lived and modest GH therapeutic efficacy.
- Combined treatment with **octreotide and cabergoline** may induce additive biochemical control.

### Radiation Therapy (for Acromegaly)

- External radiation therapy or high-energy stereotactic techniques used as **adjuvant therapy**.
- **Advantage**: patient compliance with long-term treatment is not required.
- Tumor mass is reduced, and GH levels are attenuated over time.
- **Slow effect**: 50% of patients require at least 8 years for GH levels to suppress to <5 μg/L; ∼90% achieve this after 18 years (suboptimal GH suppression).
- Patients may require **interim medical therapy** for several years.
- Most patients experience **hypothalamic-pituitary damage**, leading to gonadotropin, ACTH, and/or TSH deficiency within 10 years.

## Treatment Summary

- **Surgery** is the preferred primary treatment for GH-secreting **microadenomas**.
- **Macroadenoma resection** often results in residual GH hypersecretion, necessitating **adjuvant or primary medical therapy**.
- Patients unable to receive or respond to unimodal medical treatment may benefit from **combined treatments** or **radiation**.
- Very rarely, repeat surgery may be required.

# Cushing's Disease (ACTH-Producing Adenoma)

## Etiology and Prevalence

- **Pituitary corticotrope adenomas (Cushing’s disease)** account for **70% of patients with endogenous causes of Cushing’s syndrome**.
- **Iatrogenic hypercortisolism** is the most common cause of cushingoid features.
- Other causes of Cushing's syndrome: ectopic tumor ACTH production, cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas, adrenal carcinoma, adrenal hyperplasia. Rarely, ectopic tumor CRH production.
- ACTH-producing adenomas account for **∼10–15% of all pituitary tumors**.
- Most are relatively small **microadenomas** due to early diagnosis from clinical features. Macroadenomas also seen; some are clinically silent.
- **5–10 times more common in women than in men**.
- Exhibit **unrestrained ACTH secretion** with resultant hypercortisolemia.
- Retain **partial suppressibility** in the presence of high doses of administered glucocorticoids, forming the basis for dynamic testing to distinguish pituitary from nonpituitary causes.

## Presentation and Diagnosis

- **Challenges**: (1) distinguishing pathologic cortisol excess from physiologic or other disturbances; (2) determining etiology of pathologic cortisol excess.
- Note: A table titled "Clinical Features of Cushing's Syndrome (All Ages)" exists.
- ![[cushingsclinical.png]]

|Category|Feature|Notes|Source|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Typical Features of Chronic Cortisol Excess**|Thin skin, central obesity, hypertension, plethoric moon facies, purple striae, easy bruisability, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, gonadal dysfunction, osteoporosis, proximal muscle weakness, signs of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism), psychological disturbances (depression, mania, psychoses)|||
|**Hematopoietic Features**|Leukocytosis, lymphopenia, eosinopenia|||
|**Immune Suppression**|Delayed hypersensitivity, infection propensity|||
|**Features Suggesting Pathologic Causes**|Characteristic central redistribution of fat, thin skin with striae and bruising, proximal muscle weakness. In children and young females, early osteoporosis may be prominent.|||
|**Primary Cause of Death**|Cardiovascular disease (also increased risk of life-threatening infections and suicide)|||
|**Features Suggesting Ectopic ACTH Source**|Rapid development of features, skin hyperpigmentation, severe myopathy. Hypertension, hypokalemic alkalosis, glucose intolerance, and edema are more pronounced.|Serum potassium levels <3.3 mmol/L in ∼70% of ectopic ACTH secretion, <10% in pituitary-dependent Cushing’s syndrome.||

## Laboratory Investigation (for Cushing's Disease)

- Diagnosis based on **laboratory documentation of endogenous hypercortisolism**.
- **Screening tests**:
    - **24-h UFC** (precise and cost-effective).
    - Failure to suppress plasma cortisol after an **overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test**.
    - **Elevated midnight serum or salivary samples of cortisol**.
- **Basal plasma ACTH levels** often distinguish ACTH-independent (adrenal or exogenous) from ACTH-dependent (pituitary, ectopic) Cushing’s syndrome. Mean basal ACTH levels are about eightfold higher in ectopic ACTH secretion than in pituitary ACTH-secreting adenomas, but extensive overlap exists.
- **Dynamic testing** (differential sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback or ACTH stimulation in response to CRH or cortisol reduction) is preferred to distinguish ectopic from pituitary sources.
- Very rarely, circulating **CRH levels are elevated**, reflecting ectopic tumor-derived CRH and often ACTH.
- Most ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors are **<5 mm in diameter**, and about half are **undetectable by sensitive MRI**. High prevalence of incidental pituitary microadenomas diminishes ability to distinguish ACTH-secreting tumors from nonsecreting incidentalomas.

### Inferior Petrosal Venous Sampling (IPSS)

- Required because pituitary MRI with gadolinium enhancement is insufficiently sensitive to detect small (<2 mm) pituitary ACTH-secreting adenomas.
- **Purpose**: To distinguish pituitary ACTH-secreting adenomas from ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors.
- **Procedure**: Simultaneous assessment of ACTH in each inferior petrosal vein and in peripheral circulation. Sampling performed at baseline and 2, 5, and 10 minutes after intravenous bovine CRH (1 μg/kg) injection.
- **Interpretation**:
    - An **increased ratio (>2)** of inferior petrosal:peripheral vein ACTH confirms pituitary Cushing’s syndrome.
    - After CRH injection, peak petrosal:peripheral ACTH ratios **≥3 confirm** the presence of a pituitary ACTH-secreting tumor.
- **Sensitivity**: >95%. Very rare false-positive results. False-negative results may occur with aberrant venous drainage.
- **Risks/Contraindications**: Technically difficult; ∼0.05% of patients develop neurovascular complications. Should not be performed in patients with hypertension, known cerebrovascular disease, or a well-visualized pituitary adenoma on MRI.

## Treatment (for Cushing's Disease)

- **Selective transsphenoidal resection** is the **treatment of choice**.
- **Remission rate**: **∼80% for microadenomas**, but **<50% for macroadenomas**.
- Rarely successful when the adenoma is not visible on MRI.
- After successful resection, most patients experience a postoperative period of **symptomatic ACTH deficiency**(may last up to 12 months), requiring **low-dose cortisol replacement**.
- **Biochemical recurrence** occurs in ∼5% of initially successful surgeries.
- Prophylactic **postoperative thromboembolic management** advocated due to clotting defects.
- When initial surgery is unsuccessful, **repeat surgery** is sometimes indicated, especially if pituitary source is well documented.
- In older patients, **hemi- or total hypophysectomy** may be necessary if a discrete pituitary adenoma is not recognized.
- **Pituitary irradiation** may be used after unsuccessful surgery, but cures only **∼15% of patients**. Effects are slow and partially effective in adults.
- **Adrenal-targeted steroidogenic inhibitors** are used in combination with pituitary irradiation to block adrenal responses to persistently high ACTH levels.

### Medical Therapy (for Cushing's Disease)

- **Pasireotide LAR (10–40 mg intramuscularly)**:
    - SRL with high affinity for SST5 > SST2 receptor subtypes.
    - May control hypercortisolemia in a subset of patients when surgery is not an option or unsuccessful.
    - Lowers plasma ACTH and normalizes 24-h UFC in **∼20% of patients**.
    - Up to 40% of patients may experience pituitary tumor shrinkage.
    - Side effects similar to other SRLs: transient abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, gallstones (20%).
    - **Hyperglycemia and new-onset diabetes** develop in up to **70% of patients** (likely due to suppressed pancreatic insulin/incretin secretion). Hyperglycemia should be rigorously managed. Requires consistent long-term administration.
- **Osilodrostat (2 mg twice daily titrated up to 30 mg twice daily)**:
    - Oral **11β-hydroxylase inhibitor** that blocks adrenal gland cortisol biosynthesis.
    - Normalized 24-h UFC in **86% of patients**.
    - Side effects: mild, mostly transient gastrointestinal symptoms.
    - Monitor closely for **hypocortisolism and adrenal insufficiency**.
    - Elevated adrenal hormone precursors may lead to hypokalemia and hypertension.
    - QTc prolongation and possibly increased tumor volume also reported.
- **Ketoconazole (600–1200 mg/d twice daily)**:
    - Imidazole derivative antimycotic agent that inhibits several P450 enzymes.
    - Effectively lowers cortisol in most patients.
    - Side effects: elevated hepatic transaminases, gynecomastia, impotence, gastrointestinal upset, edema.
- **Mifepristone (300–1200 mg/d)**:
    - Glucocorticoid receptor antagonist that blocks peripheral cortisol action.
    - Approved to treat hyperglycemia in Cushing’s disease.
    - Does not target the pituitary tumor; ACTH and cortisol levels remain elevated, obviating a reliable circulating biomarker.
    - Side effects largely due to general antagonism of other steroid hormones: hypokalemia, endometrial hyperplasia, hypoadrenalism, hypertension.
- **Metyrapone (2–4 g/d)**:
    - Inhibits 11β-hydroxylase activity.
    - Normalizes plasma cortisol in up to **75% of patients**.
    - Side effects: nausea, vomiting, rash, exacerbation of acne or hirsutism.
- **Mitotane (3–6 g/d orally in four divided doses)**:
    - Suppresses cortisol hypersecretion by inhibiting 11β-hydroxylase and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzymes, and by destroying adrenocortical cells.
    - Side effects: gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, gynecomastia, hyperlipidemia, skin rash, hepatic enzyme elevation. May also lead to hypoaldosteronism.
- **Other agents**: aminoglutethimide (250 mg tid), trilostane (200–1000 mg/d), cyproheptadine (24 mg/d), and IV etomidate (0.3 mg/kg per h).
- **Glucocorticoid insufficiency** is a potential side effect of agents used to block steroidogenesis.

### Adrenalectomy

- The use of steroidogenic inhibitors has decreased the need for bilateral adrenalectomy.
- Surgical removal of both adrenal glands corrects hypercortisolism but may be associated with significant morbidity rates.
- Necessitates permanent glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement.
- In the setting of residual corticotrope adenoma tissue, adrenalectomy predisposes to **Nelson’s syndrome** (rapid pituitary tumor enlargement and increased pigmentation secondary to high ACTH levels).
- **Prophylactic radiation therapy** may be indicated to prevent Nelson’s syndrome after adrenalectomy.

# Nonfunctioning and Gonadotropin-Producing Pituitary Adenomas

## Etiology and Prevalence

- Include tumors that secrete little or no pituitary hormones into systemic circulation, or too little to result in recognizable clinical features.
- **Most common type of pituitary adenoma**.
- Usually **macroadenomas** at diagnosis because clinical features are not apparent until tumor mass effects occur.
- Most clinically nonfunctioning adenomas originate from **gonadotrope cells or pituitary null cells**.
- Typically produce small amounts of intact gonadotropins (usually FSH) and uncombined α, LH β, and FSH β subunits.
- Tumor secretion may lead to elevated α and FSH β subunits, and very rarely, increased LH β subunit levels. Some adenomas express α subunits without FSH or LH.
- A **TRH stimulation test often induces an atypical increase of tumor-derived gonadotropins or subunits**.

## Presentation and Diagnosis

- Often present with **optic chiasm pressure and other symptoms of local expansion**.
- May be **incidentally discovered** on MRI (incidentaloma).
- **Rarely**: menstrual disturbances or ovarian hyperstimulation in women with large tumors producing FSH and LH; ovaries may resemble polycystic ovarian syndrome and produce very high estrogen levels.
- **More commonly**: adenoma compression of the pituitary stalk or surrounding pituitary tissue leads to **attenuated LH and features of hypogonadism**.
- **PRL levels are usually slightly increased** due to stalk compression. It is important to distinguish this from true prolactinomas, as nonfunctioning tumors do not shrink in response to dopamine agonists.

## Laboratory Investigation

- **Goal**: classify tumor type, identify hormonal markers of tumor activity, and detect possible hypopituitarism.
- **Free α subunit levels** may be elevated in 10–15% of patients.
- In female patients, peri- or postmenopausal basal FSH concentrations are difficult to distinguish from tumor-derived FSH. Premenopausal women have cycling FSH levels, preventing clear distinction.
- In men, gonadotropin-secreting tumors may be diagnosed by **slightly increased gonadotropins (FSH > LH)** in the setting of a pituitary mass. Testosterone levels are usually low despite normal or increased LH, possibly reflecting reduced LH bioactivity or loss of pulsatility. This pattern is also seen in primary gonadal failure and aging, so increased gonadotropins alone are insufficient for diagnosis.
- In most gonadotrope adenomas, **TRH administration stimulates LH β subunit secretion** (not seen in normal individuals). GnRH testing is not helpful.
- Diagnosis usually rests on **immunohistochemical analyses of surgically resected tumor tissue**, as mass effects usually necessitate resection.

## Silent Adenomas

- Clinically inapparent (**silent**) somatotrope or corticotrope adenomas may only be diagnosed by **immunostaining of resected tumor tissue**.
- These silent tumors usually grow **more aggressively** and account for up to 20% of all nonfunctioning adenomas.
- If **PRL levels are <100 μg/L** in a patient with a pituitary mass, a nonfunctioning adenoma causing pituitary stalk compression should be considered.

## Treatment

- **Asymptomatic small nonfunctioning microadenomas** with no threat to vision may be followed with **regular MRI and visual field testing** without immediate intervention.
- For **macroadenomas**, **transsphenoidal surgery is indicated** to reduce tumor size and relieve mass effects.
- Vision improves in 70% of patients with preoperative visual field defects.
- Preexisting hypopituitarism from tumor mass effects may improve or resolve completely.
- MRI scans should be performed yearly beginning ∼6 months postoperatively to detect tumor regrowth.
- **Recurrence**: ∼15% of nonfunctioning tumors recur within 5–6 years after successful surgical resection.
- When substantial tumor remains after surgery, **adjuvant radiotherapy may be indicated** to prevent regrowth. Radiotherapy may be deferred if no postoperative residual mass is evident.
- Nonfunctioning pituitary tumors **respond poorly to dopamine agonist treatment**.
- **SRLs are largely ineffective** for shrinking these tumors.
- The selective GnRH antagonist **Nal-Glu GnRH suppresses FSH hypersecretion** but has no effect on adenoma size.

# TSH-Secreting Adenomas

## Characteristics and Diagnosis

- TSH-producing macroadenomas are **very rare**.
- Often **large and locally invasive** when they occur.
- Patients usually present with **thyroid goiter and hyperthyroidism** (reflecting chronic TSH overproduction).
- **Diagnosis** based on:
    - Demonstrating **elevated serum free T4 levels**.
    - **Inappropriately normal or high TSH secretion**.
    - **MRI evidence of a pituitary adenoma**.
- **Elevated free glycoprotein hormone α subunits** are seen in many patients.
- **Important to exclude other causes of inappropriate TSH secretion**:
    - **Resistance to thyroid hormone**: an autosomal dominant disorder from thyroid hormone β receptor mutations. The presence of a pituitary mass and elevated β subunit levels are suggestive of a TSH-secreting tumor.
    - **Dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia syndromes**: caused by mutations in serum thyroid hormone binding proteins; characterized by elevated thyroid hormone levels but with normal rather than suppressed TSH levels. Free thyroid hormone levels are normal in these disorders.

## Treatment

- **Initial therapeutic approach**: **remove or debulk the tumor mass surgically** (usually transsphenoidal).
- **Total resection not often achieved** as most are large and locally invasive.
- Normal circulating thyroid hormone levels achieved in about two-thirds of patients after surgery.
- **Thyroid ablation or antithyroid drugs** (methimazole and propylthiouracil) can be used to reduce thyroid hormone levels.
- **SRL treatment**:
    - Effectively **normalizes TSH and α subunit hypersecretion**.
    - **Shrinks the tumor mass in 50% of patients**.
    - **Improves visual fields in 75%** of patients.
    - **Euthyroidism is restored** in most patients.
    - Because SRLs markedly suppress TSH, biochemical hypothyroidism often requires **concomitant thyroid hormone replacement**, which may also further control tumor growth.

# Aggressive Adenomas

## Characteristics and Management

- Despite rarity of malignant transformation and metastatic lesions, a subset of pituitary adenomas undergoes **aggressive local growth and central nervous system invasion**.
- Associated with **high Ki67 levels (>4%)**.
- **Silent corticotrope and somatotrope tumors**, as well as **prolactinomas occurring in middle-aged men**, are particularly prone to aggressive growth and recurrence.
- Patients with these tumors usually require an **integrated management approach** including **repeat surgeries and irradiation**.
- **Temozolomide** has also been used with variable responses.

Imagine these notes as a **comprehensive blueprint for a complex building**. Each heading is a major section of the building, like the "Foundation" (Evaluation of Sellar Masses) or "Main Structures" (Specific Adenoma Types). Within each section, subheadings are like detailed rooms or systems (e.g., "Plumbing" for Etiology, "Electrical" for Treatment). The bullet points are the specific components and measurements within each room, ensuring no crucial detail is missed. The tables are like organized inventory lists for key elements, making it easy to see all the possible materials or features at a glance. Just as a good blueprint ensures the building is understood from every angle, these notes aim to provide a thorough understanding of pituitary tumor syndromes.

# Classes of Hormones

- 
> [!note]
> Hormones are divided into **five major types**:
>     - **Amino acid derivatives**: such as dopamine, catecholamine, and thyroid hormone.
> 	    - Tyrosine -- T3, T4, , Adrenaline > noradrenaline > dopamine 
> 	    - Tryptophan 
> 		    - serotonin from raphe nuclei , GIT (centrocromafin cells)
> 		    - melatonin from pineal gland is a serotonin derivative 
>     - **Small neuropeptides**: all **hypothalamic, posterior pituitary and ACTH** such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), somatostatin, and vasopressin.
>     - **Large proteins**: such as insulin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and parathyroid hormone (PTH)., **GH 191 AA, PRL 199AA** 
>     - **Steroid hormones**: such as cortisol and estrogen, synthesized from cholesterol-based precursors., adrenal cortical (aldosterone , cortisol), DHEAS, androstenedione
>     - **Vitamin derivatives**: such as retinoids (vitamin A) and vitamin D.
>     - **Glycoprotein** --> protein+carb --> FSH, LH, TSH (all share common alpha subunit)

- A variety of **peptide growth factors**, like insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), share actions with hormones but often act more locally.
- **Receptor Interaction**:
    - Amino acid derivatives and peptide hormones generally interact with **cell-surface membrane receptors**.
    - Steroids, thyroid hormones, vitamin D, and retinoids are **lipid-soluble** and primarily bind to **intracellular nuclear receptors**. Many of these also interact with membrane receptors or intracellular signaling proteins.

## Hormone and Receptor Families

- ![[hormonereceptorfamily.png]]
- Hormones and receptors can be grouped into families based on **structural similarities** and evolutionary origins.
- The evolution of these families creates diverse yet highly selective pathways of hormone action.
- **Glycoprotein Hormone Family**:
    - Includes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), LH, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).
    - They are **heterodimers** sharing a common **α subunit**, while their **β subunits are distinct** and confer specific biologic actions.
    - The β subunits have similar three-dimensional architecture due to conserved disulfide bonds.
    - This family likely arose from a **common ancestral gene** through gene duplication and subsequent divergence.
    - Related **G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs)** have co-evolved for each glycoprotein hormone. These receptors are structurally similar and predominantly coupled to the **Gsα signaling pathway**.
    - There is minimal overlap in hormone binding (e.g., TSH binds with high specificity to the TSH receptor, minimally to LH or FSH receptors).
    - However, subtle physiologic consequences of hormone cross-reactivity can occur; for example, very high levels of hCG during pregnancy can stimulate the TSH receptor and increase thyroid hormone levels.
- **Insulin/IGF Family**:
    - IGF1 and IGF2 have structural similarities, especially in their precursor forms.
    - There is moderate **cross-talk** among members, unlike the high specificity seen with glycoprotein hormones.
    - High concentrations of an IGF2 precursor produced by certain tumors (e.g., sarcomas) can cause **hypoglycemia**, partly due to binding to insulin and IGF1 receptors.
    - High concentrations of insulin can also bind to the IGF1 receptor, potentially contributing to clinical manifestations in conditions with chronic hyperinsulinemia.
- **PTH and Parathyroid Hormone–Related Peptide (PTHrP)**:
    - PTH is produced by parathyroid glands, while PTHrP is expressed at high levels during development and by various tumors.
    - These hormones have amino acid sequence similarity, particularly in their amino-terminal regions.
    - Both hormones bind to the **PTH1R receptor**, which is expressed in bone and kidney.
    - Excessive production of either hormone can result in hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia, making differentiation difficult solely based on serum chemistries. Sensitive and specific assays now allow for better distinction.
- **Nuclear Receptor Family**:
    - Subdivided based on specificities for DNA-binding sites:
        - **Type 1 receptors**: glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor; they bind steroids.
        - **Type 2 receptors**: thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptor, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor; they bind thyroid hormone, vitamin D, retinoic acid, or lipid derivatives.
    - Functional domains like the **zinc finger DNA-binding domains are highly conserved**.
    - Selective amino acid differences within this domain confer DNA sequence specificity.
    - Hormone-binding domains are more variable, allowing for diverse small molecule binding to different nuclear receptors.
    - **Hormone binding is generally highly specific** for a single type of nuclear receptor, with few exceptions.
    - **Exceptions to Nuclear Receptor Specificity**:
        - **Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors**: The mineralocorticoid receptor binds glucocorticoids with high affinity. An enzyme, **11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase**, in renal tubular cells inactivates glucocorticoids, allowing selective responses to mineralocorticoids like aldosterone. However, in very high glucocorticoid concentrations (e.g., Cushing’s syndrome), this degradation pathway saturates, leading to excessive cortisol binding to mineralocorticoid receptors, causing sodium retention and potassium wasting (pronounced in ectopic ACTH syndromes).
        - **Estrogen receptor**: Can bind an array of compounds, some with little apparent structural similarity to its high-affinity ligand estradiol. This includes "environmental estrogens" like resveratrol, octylphenol, and many aromatic hydrocarbons. This characteristic allows for the synthesis of clinically useful antagonists (e.g., tamoxifen) and selective estrogen response modulators (SERMs) like raloxifene. These compounds generate distinct estrogen receptor conformations, altering receptor interactions with transcription machinery and conferring unique actions.

# Hormone Synthesis and Processing

- The synthesis of peptide hormones and their receptors follows a **classic pathway of gene expression**: transcription → mRNA → protein → posttranslational protein processing → intracellular sorting, followed by membrane integration or secretion.
- Many hormones are embedded within **larger precursor polypeptides** that are proteolytically processed to yield the biologically active hormone. Examples include proopiomelanocortin (POMC) → ACTH; proglucagon → glucagon; proinsulin → insulin; and pro-PTH → PTH.
- These precursors can generate **multiple biologically active peptides** (e.g., proglucagon generates glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)).
- Precursors are typically **inactive**, adding an additional level of control through peptide processing.
- Prohormone conversion also occurs for certain steroids (testosterone → dihydrotestosterone) and thyroid hormone (T4 → T3).
- **Peptide precursor processing** is linked to intracellular sorting pathways that transport proteins to appropriate vesicles and enzymes for specific cleavage steps, protein folding, and translocation to secretory vesicles.
    - Hormones destined for secretion are translocated across the endoplasmic reticulum, guided by an amino-terminal signal sequence that is subsequently cleaved.
    - Cell-surface receptors are inserted into the membrane via hydrophobic amino acid segments.
    - During translocation, hormones and receptors undergo **posttranslational modifications** (e.g., glycosylation, phosphorylation), which can alter protein conformation, circulating half-life, and biologic activity.
- **Steroid hormone synthesis** is based on modifications of the precursor, **cholesterol**.
    - Multiple regulated enzymatic steps are required for the synthesis of testosterone, estradiol, cortisol, and vitamin D.
    - This large number of synthetic steps predisposes to numerous genetic and acquired disorders of steroidogenesis.
- **Endocrine gene regulation**:
    - Endocrine genes contain regulatory DNA elements similar to other genes, but their exquisite control by hormones reflects the presence of specific **hormone response elements**.
    - TSH genes, for instance, are directly repressed by thyroid hormones acting through the thyroid hormone receptor (TR).
    - Steroidogenic enzyme gene expression requires specific **transcription factors** (e.g., steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1)) in conjunction with signals from trophic hormones (e.g., ACTH or LH).
    - Once activated, **SF1** acts as a **master regulator**, inducing a large array of genes necessary for steroidogenic and metabolic pathways.
    - For some hormones, substantial regulation occurs at the level of **translational efficiency**; insulin biosynthesis, for example, is primarily regulated at the translational and secretory levels in response to glucose or amino acid levels.

# Hormone Secretion, Transport, and Degradation

- The circulating level of a hormone is determined by its **rate of secretion and its half-life**.
- **Peptide hormones** (e.g., GnRH, insulin, growth hormone (GH)):
    - Stored in **secretory granules** after protein processing.
    - Stimulus for release is typically a releasing factor or neural signal, inducing rapid changes in voltage-gated channel activity or intracellular calcium, leading to granule fusion with the plasma membrane and release into circulation.
- **Steroid hormones**:
    - Diffuse into the circulation as they are synthesized, so their secretory rates are closely aligned with synthesis rates.
    - ACTH and LH stimulate steroidogenesis by activating the **steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein**(transports cholesterol into the mitochondrion) and other rate-limiting steps (e.g., cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, CYP11A1).
- **Hormone transport and degradation** dictate how rapidly a hormonal signal decays.
    - **Short half-lives**: Some hormone signals are evanescent (e.g., somatostatin). Most protein hormones (e.g., ACTH, GH, prolactin (PRL), PTH, LH) have relatively short half-lives (<20 min).
        - A short half-life allows local control (somatostatin).
        - Rapid hormone decay is useful in clinical settings, e.g., intraoperative PTH levels to confirm parathyroid adenoma removal.
    - **Longer half-lives**: TSH has a prolonged half-life, generating relatively constant serum levels despite discrete pulses. T4 has a circulating half-life of 7 days, requiring over a month to reach a new steady state and allowing single daily doses. T3 has a half-life of 1 day, leading to more dynamic serum levels and requiring administration two to three times per day. Synthetic glucocorticoids vary widely in half-lives, with longer ones (e.g., dexamethasone) causing greater suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
- **Accurate profiling of pulsatile hormones** requires frequent blood sampling (every 10 min or less over 8–24 h), which is impractical clinically. Alternatives include pooling 3-4 blood samples (30-min intervals) or interpreting results within a wide normal range.
- **Serum-binding proteins**:
    - Many hormones circulate in association with these proteins.
    - **Examples**:
        - T4 and T3 bind to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), albumin, and thyroxine-binding prealbumin (TBPA).
        - Cortisol binds to cortisol-binding globulin (CBG).
        - Androgen and estrogen bind to sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG).
        - IGF1 and IGF2 bind to multiple IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs).
        - GH interacts with GH-binding protein (GHBP).
        - Activin binds to follistatin.
    - **Functions**: Provide a hormone reservoir, prevent rapid degradation, restrict hormone access to certain sites, and modulate "free" (unbound) hormone concentrations.
    - Most identified binding protein abnormalities have little clinical consequence beyond diagnostic problems (e.g., TBG deficiency reduces total thyroid hormone, but free levels remain normal).
    - Liver disease and certain medications can influence binding protein levels (e.g., estrogen increases TBG) or displace hormones from them (e.g., salsalate displaces T4 from TBG).
    - Generally, only **unbound hormone is available to interact with receptors** and elicit a biologic response. Short-term binding protein perturbations induce compensatory adaptations through feedback.
    - **SHBG changes in women** are an exception: decreased SHBG due to insulin resistance or androgen excess increases unbound testosterone, potentially contributing to hirsutism in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), without adequate compensatory feedback because estrogen, not testosterone, primarily regulates the reproductive axis.
    - **Megalin**, a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family member, serves as an endocytotic receptor for thyroglobulin, carrier-bound vitamins A and D, and SHBG-bound androgens and estrogens. After internalization, carrier proteins are degraded, releasing ligands intracellularly. Other membrane transporters for thyroid hormones also exist.
- **Hormone degradation** can be an important mechanism for regulating concentrations locally.
    - **11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase** inactivates glucocorticoids in renal tubular cells, preventing actions through the mineralocorticoid receptor.
    - **Thyroid hormone deiodinases** convert T4 to T3 and can inactivate T3.
    - **Cyp26b1** degrades retinoic acid during development, preventing male primordial germ cells from entering meiosis.

# Hormone Action Through Receptors

- Receptors for hormones are divided into two major classes: **membrane** and **nuclear**.
- **Membrane receptors** primarily bind peptide hormones and catecholamines.
- **Nuclear receptors** bind small molecules that can diffuse across the cell membrane, such as steroids and vitamin D.
- **General principles of hormone-receptor interactions**:
    - Hormones bind to receptors with **specificity and affinity** that generally coincides with the dynamic range of circulating hormone concentrations (typically **10⁻¹² to 10⁻⁹ M**).
    - Hormones rapidly associate and dissociate from receptors in a bimolecular reaction, making receptor occupancy a function of hormone concentration and receptor affinity.
    - **Receptor numbers vary greatly in different target tissues**, providing a major determinant of tissue-specific responses.
        - **Tissue-specific distribution**: ACTH receptors are almost exclusively in the adrenal cortex, LH receptors predominantly in the gonads.
        - **Wide distribution**: Insulin and TRs are widely distributed, reflecting metabolic response needs in all tissues.

### Membrane Receptors

- Membrane receptors for hormones can be divided into several major groups:
    1. **Seven transmembrane GPCRs**.
    2. **Tyrosine kinase receptors**.
    3. **Cytokine receptors**.
    4. **Serine kinase receptors**.
- **Seven Transmembrane GPCRs**:
    - Bind a vast array of hormones, including large proteins (e.g., LH, PTH), small peptides (e.g., TRH, somatostatin), catecholamines (epinephrine, dopamine), and minerals (e.g., calcium).
    - The **extracellular domains** vary widely in size and are the major binding site for large hormones.
    - **Transmembrane-spanning regions** consist of hydrophobic α-helical domains that traverse the lipid bilayer, forming a hydrophobic pocket for small ligands.
    - **Hormone binding** induces conformational changes that transduce structural changes to the intracellular domain, which serves as a docking site for G proteins.
    - **G proteins**:
        - Bind guanine nucleotides (GTP, GDP) and form a **heterotrimeric complex** composed of α and βγ subunits.
        - The **α subunit** contains the guanine nucleotide–binding site and an intrinsic GTPase that hydrolyzes GTP to GDP. The βγ subunits are tightly associated and modulate α subunit activity, also mediating their own effector signaling pathways.
        - **Regulation**: G protein activity is regulated by a cycle involving GTP hydrolysis and dynamic interactions between the α and βγ subunits.
        - **Activation**: Hormone binding to the receptor induces GDP dissociation, allowing Gα to bind GTP and dissociate from the βγ complex. The activated Gα subunit mediates signal transduction through various enzymes (e.g., adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C).
        - **Deactivation**: GTP hydrolysis to GDP allows reassociation with the βγ subunits, restoring the inactive state.
        - G proteins interact with other cellular proteins, including kinases, channels, G protein–coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), and arrestins, which mediate signaling as well as receptor desensitization and recycling.
        - **Constitutive activation**: Mutations in Gsα that eliminate GTPase activity result in constitutive activation because GTP-bound Gsα cannot be converted to its inactive GDP-bound state.
    - **Endocrinopathies Resulting from GPCR Mutations**:
        - ![[gpcrmutation.png]]
        - **Loss-of-function mutations** are generally recessive and inactivate hormone signaling, leading to presentations resembling glandular failure syndromes (e.g., mutations in LH-R, FSH-R, TSH-R).
        - **Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations** induce conformational changes in the GPCR that mimic the activated state induced by hormone binding, resulting in constitutively active G protein coupling to cell signaling pathways (most commonly via cAMP and protein kinase A).
            - **Germline GOF mutations** are heritable and present in early life (e.g., LH-R, TSH-R).
            - **Sporadic, somatic mutations** can cause clonal expansion of hyperfunctioning cells.
        - **TSH-R Mutations**:
            - **Recessive inactivating mutations** cause congenital hypothyroidism with thyroid gland hypoplasia and resistance to TSH, clinically resembling primary hypothyroidism (low T4, high TSH).
            - **Germline activating mutations** cause congenital hyperthyroidism, an autosomal dominant disorder where one activating TSH-R allele is sufficient to induce cellular hyperfunction and disease. This presents in infancy and causes hyperplastic growth and hyperfunction resembling Graves’ disease.
            - **Somatic activating TSH-R mutation** occurring later in life leads to clonal expansion of the thyrocyte and an autonomous hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule.
        - **Gsα Mutations**:
            - Similar to somatic TSH-R mutations, somatic Gsα mutations (inactivating GTPase) can also cause an autonomous hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule by mimicking chronic TSH stimulation. Approximately one-third of hyperfunctioning "hot" thyroid nodules harbor sporadic mutations in either the TSH-R or Gsα (TSH-R mutations are more common).
            - Gsα mutations in pituitary somatotropes can mimic activation of the growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) pathway, leading to **GH-producing adenomas and acromegaly**.
            - Gsα mutations occurring early in development (typically mosaic) cause **McCune-Albright syndrome**, where activated G protein pathways mimic the actions of various hormones (PTH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), TSH, GHRH) in different tissues.
            - Germline inactivating Gsα mutations cause a range of disorders (e.g., Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO), pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP), pseudohypoparathyroidism types 1b, 1c, and 2) due to complex transmission and expression related to imprinting.
- **Tyrosine Kinase Receptors**:
    - Transduce signals for insulin and various growth factors (e.g., IGF1, epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factors).
    - **Cysteine-rich extracellular domains** contain ligand binding sites.
    - After ligand binding, these receptors undergo **autophosphorylation**, inducing interactions with intracellular adaptor proteins (e.g., Shc, insulin receptor substrates (IRS)).
    - The insulin receptor activates multiple kinases, including the Raf-Ras-MAPK and the Akt/protein kinase B pathways.
    - Tyrosine kinase receptors play a prominent role in **cell growth and differentiation** as well as intermediary metabolism.
- **Cytokine Receptors**:
    - The GH and PRL receptors belong to this family.
    - Ligand binding induces receptor interaction with **Janus kinases (JAKs)**, which phosphorylate members of the **signal transduction and activators of transcription (STAT) family**, as well as other signaling pathways (Ras, PI3-K, MAPK).
    - Activated STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus and stimulate target gene expression.
- **Serine Kinase Receptors**:
    - Mediate the actions of activins, transforming growth factor β, müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS; also known as anti-müllerian hormone (AMH)), and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs).
    - This family consists of type I and type II subunits.
    - They signal through proteins called **smads**, which serve a dual role of transducing the receptor signal and acting as transcription factors.
    - The pleomorphic actions of these growth factors mean they act primarily in a **local (paracrine or autocrine) manner**.
    - Binding proteins like **follistatin** (which binds activin and other family members) inactivate growth factors and restrict their distribution.
- **Disease-causing mutations** also occur in these receptor classes:
    - Insulin receptor mutations cause an extreme form of insulin resistance.
    - GH receptor mutations cause Laron-type dwarfism (characterized by low IGF1 and high GH).
    - AMH receptor mutations cause persistent müllerian duct syndrome.
    - These are **autosomal recessive** and relatively uncommon hormone resistance syndromes.
    - Activating mutations are unusual, with an exception being the **RET tyrosine kinase receptor**, which causes the autosomal dominant disorder MEN type 2 (MEN2).

### Nuclear Receptors

- The nuclear receptor family has grown to nearly 100 members, many of which are "orphan receptors" whose ligands remain unidentified.
- Most nuclear receptors are classified based on their ligands.
- All nuclear receptors ultimately act to **increase or decrease gene transcription**.
- **Location**: Some (e.g., glucocorticoid receptor) reside primarily in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus after ligand binding, while others (e.g., TR) are located in the nucleus.
- Evidence suggests certain nuclear receptors (e.g., glucocorticoid, estrogen) can also act at the membrane or in the cytoplasm to activate or repress signal transduction pathways, providing a mechanism for **cross-talk between membrane and nuclear receptors**.
- **Structure**:
    - The **DNA-binding domain**, consisting of two zinc fingers, contacts specific DNA recognition sequences in target genes.
    - Most nuclear receptors bind to DNA as **dimers**, with each monomer recognizing an individual DNA motif or "half-site".
    - **Steroid receptors** (glucocorticoid, estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors) bind to DNA as **homodimers** and have palindromic DNA recognition half-sites.
    - **Thyroid, retinoid, peroxisome proliferator activated, and vitamin D receptors** preferentially bind to DNA as **heterodimers** in combination with **retinoid X receptors (RXRs)**; their DNA half-sites are typically arranged as direct repeats.
- **Transcriptional Control**:
    - The **carboxy-terminal hormone-binding domains** mediate transcriptional control.
    - For **Type II receptors** (e.g., TR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)), co-repressor proteins bind to the receptor in the absence of ligand and silence gene transcription. Hormone binding induces conformational changes, triggering co-repressor release and recruitment of **coactivators** that stimulate transcription.
    - Disease states can be associated with defective regulation (e.g., in promyelocytic leukemia, fusion of RARα causes aberrant gene silencing; retinoic acid treatment reverses this).
    - Most **Type 1 steroid receptors** interact weakly with co-repressors, but ligand binding still induces interactions with various coactivators.
    - **SERMs** induce distinct estrogen receptor conformations, leading to tissue-specific responses (breast, bone, uterus) by altering interactions with coactivators.
    - The **receptor-coactivator complex stimulates gene transcription** by:
        1. Recruitment of enzymes (histone acetyl transferases) that modify chromatin structure.
        2. Interactions with additional transcription factors on the target gene.
        3. Direct interactions with components of the general transcription apparatus to enhance RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription.
    - Nuclear receptor–mediated transcription involves relatively **rapid (e.g., 30–60 min) cycling of transcription complexes** on target genes.
- **Nuclear Receptor Mutations**:
    - An important cause of endocrine disease.
    - **Androgen receptor mutations** cause **androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)**.
        - Located on the X chromosome, making phenotypic expression more common.
        - Affected individuals are XY phenotypic females with retained testes and male-range testosterone levels.
        - Tissue insensitivity varies with mutation severity.
        - Müllerian structures are absent because Sertoli cells of the testis produce AMH during development.
        - Female carriers are phenotypically normal.
    - Recessive mutations of the estrogen, glucocorticoid, and vitamin D receptors occur but are rare.
    - **Thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ) mutations** have unusual pathophysiology.
        - They are **autosomal dominant** and function via a "**dominant negative" mechanism** to cause **resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH)**.
        - Mutations occur in selected regions of the TRβ hormone-binding domain, preserving the mutant receptor's ability to heterodimerize with RXR, interact with co-repressors, and bind to DNA.
        - Mutant receptors act as antagonists of receptors from the normal TRβ gene copy.
        - Affected patients have high T4 and T3 and inappropriately elevated (unsuppressed) TSH, reflecting impaired feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.
        - Organ systems show variable resistance based on the relative expression of TRβ and TRα.
        - Mutations in TRα and PPARγ genes can also cause disease via an analogous dominant negative manner.

# Functions of Hormones

- Most biologic responses require the **integration of several different hormone pathways**.
- The physiologic functions of hormones can be divided into **three general types**:
    1. **Growth and differentiation**.
    2. **Maintenance of homeostasis**.
    3. **Reproduction**.

## Growth

- Multiple hormones and nutritional factors mediate the complex phenomenon of growth.
- **Causes of short stature**: GH deficiency, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, precocious puberty, malnutrition, chronic illness, or genetic abnormalities affecting epiphyseal growth plates (e.g., FGFR3 and SHOX mutations).
- **Hormones that stimulate growth**: GH, IGF1, thyroid hormones.
- **Hormones that lead to epiphyseal closure**: Sex steroids.
- Understanding hormonal interactions is important for diagnosis and management of growth disorders (e.g., delaying exposure to high sex steroids may enhance GH treatment efficacy).

## Maintenance of Homeostasis

- While virtually all hormones affect homeostasis, the most important include:
    - **Thyroid hormone**: Controls ~25% of basal metabolism in most tissues.
    - **Cortisol**: Exerts a permissive action for many hormones in addition to its direct effects.
    - **PTH**: Regulates calcium and phosphorus levels.
    - **Vasopressin**: Regulates serum osmolality by controlling renal free-water clearance.
    - **Mineralocorticoids**: Control vascular volume and serum electrolyte (Na⁺, K⁺) concentrations.
    - **Insulin**: Maintains euglycemia in the fed and fasted states.
- **Defense against hypoglycemia** is an impressive example of integrated hormone action:
    - In response to fasting and falling blood glucose, insulin secretion is suppressed, leading to decreased glucose uptake and enhanced glycogenolysis, lipolysis, proteolysis, and gluconeogenesis to mobilize fuel sources.
    - If hypoglycemia develops (often from insulin or sulfonylureas), an orchestrated counterregulatory response occurs: glucagon and epinephrine rapidly stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, while GH and cortisol act over several hours to raise glucose levels and antagonize insulin action.
- **Free-water clearance** is primarily controlled by vasopressin, but cortisol and thyroid hormone are also important for facilitating renal tubular responses to vasopressin.
- **Calcium metabolism**: PTH and vitamin D function interdependently to control calcium metabolism.
    - PTH stimulates renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
    - 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D increases calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and enhances PTH action in bone.
    - Increased calcium, along with vitamin D, feeds back to suppress PTH, thus maintaining calcium balance.
- **Stress Response**:
    - Multiple endocrine and cytokine pathways are activated depending on the severity and nature of stress (acute or chronic).
    - In severe acute stress (e.g., trauma or shock), the **sympathetic nervous system is activated**, releasing catecholamines, leading to increased cardiac output, a primed musculoskeletal system, increased mean blood pressure, and stimulated glucose production.
    - Stress-induced pathways converge on the **hypothalamus**, stimulating vasopressin and CRH.
    - These hormones, along with cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL) 2, IL-6), increase ACTH and GH production.
    - ACTH stimulates the adrenal gland, increasing cortisol, which helps sustain blood pressure and dampen the inflammatory response. Increased vasopressin acts to conserve free water.

## Reproduction

- The stages of reproduction include:
    1. **Sex determination** during fetal development.
    2. **Sexual maturation** during puberty.
    3. **Conception, pregnancy, lactation, and child rearing**.
    4. **Cessation of reproductive capability** at menopause.
- Each stage involves an **orchestrated interplay of multiple hormones**.
- **Menstrual Cycle Example**:
    - In the early follicular phase, pulsatile secretion of LH and FSH stimulates progressive maturation of the ovarian follicle.
    - This results in gradually increasing estrogen and progesterone levels, enhancing pituitary sensitivity to GnRH.
    - Combined with accelerated GnRH secretion, this triggers the **LH surge** and rupture of the mature follicle.
    - **Inhibin**, a protein produced by granulosa cells, enhances follicular growth and selectively suppresses FSH at the pituitary without affecting LH.
    - Growth factors like EGF and IGF1 modulate follicular responsiveness to gonadotropins.
    - Vascular endothelial growth factor and prostaglandins play a role in follicle vascularization and rupture.
- **Pregnancy and Lactation**:
    - Increased PRL production combined with placentally derived steroids (estrogen and progesterone) prepares the breast for lactation.
    - Estrogens induce progesterone receptor production, increasing responsiveness to progesterone.
    - The nervous system and oxytocin mediate the suckling response and milk release.

# Hormonal Feedback Regulatory Systems

- **Feedback control**, both negative and positive, is a fundamental feature of endocrine systems.
- **Negative Feedback**:
    - Governs each of the major hypothalamic-pituitary-hormone axes, maintaining hormone levels within a relatively narrow range.
    - **Examples of Hypothalamic-Pituitary Negative Feedback**:
        - **Thyroid hormones** on the TRH-TSH axis.
        - **Cortisol** on the CRH-ACTH axis.
        - **Gonadal steroids** on the GnRH-LH/FSH axis.
        - **IGF1** on the GHRH-GH axis.
    - These regulatory loops include both positive (e.g., TRH, TSH) and negative (e.g., T4, T3) components for exquisite control.
    - For example, a small reduction of thyroid hormone triggers a rapid increase of TRH and TSH secretion, stimulating the thyroid gland and increasing thyroid hormone production. Once normal levels are reached, thyroid hormone feeds back to suppress TRH and TSH, attaining a new steady state.
    - Feedback regulation also occurs for endocrine systems not involving the pituitary gland (e.g., calcium feedback on PTH, glucose inhibition of insulin secretion, leptin feedback on the hypothalamus).
- **Positive Feedback Control**:
    - Occurs but is not well understood.
    - The primary example is **estrogen-mediated stimulation of the midcycle LH surge**.
    - While chronic low estrogen levels are inhibitory, gradually rising estrogen levels stimulate LH secretion.
    - This involves activation of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator and enhanced pituitary gonadotrope sensitivity to GnRH, leading to amplification of LH release.

## Paracrine and Autocrine Control

- Local regulatory systems, often involving growth factors, are increasingly recognized.
- **Paracrine regulation**: Factors released by one cell act on an adjacent cell in the same tissue.
    - Example: Somatostatin secretion by pancreatic islet δ cells inhibits insulin secretion from nearby β cells.
- **Autocrine regulation**: Describes the action of a factor on the same cell from which it is produced.
    - Example: IGF1 acts on many cells that produce it, including chondrocytes, breast epithelium, and gonadal cells.
- These local controls are difficult to document because local growth factor concentrations cannot be readily measured.
- **Anatomic relationships of glandular systems** also significantly influence hormonal exposure:
    - The physical organization of islet cells enhances their intercellular communication.
    - The portal vasculature of the hypothalamic-pituitary system exposes the pituitary to high concentrations of hypothalamic releasing factors.
    - Testicular seminiferous tubules are exposed to high testosterone levels produced by interdigitated Leydig cells.
    - The pancreas receives nutrient information and local exposure to peptide hormones (incretins) from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - The liver is the proximal target of insulin action due to portal drainage from the pancreas.

## Hormonal Rhythms

- Feedback regulatory systems are superimposed on **hormonal rhythms** that aid adaptation to the environment.
- Rhythms are affected by seasonal changes, the daily light-dark cycle, sleep, meals, and stress.
- The **menstrual cycle** repeats on average every 28 days, reflecting the time needed for follicular maturation, ovulation, and potential implantation.
- Essentially all **pituitary hormone rhythms** are entrained to sleep and the circadian cycle, generating reproducible patterns that repeat approximately every 24 hours.
    - The **HPA axis**, for example, exhibits characteristic peaks of ACTH and cortisol production in the early morning, with a nadir during the night.
    - Recognition of these rhythms is important for endocrine testing and treatment.
    - Patients with Cushing’s syndrome show increased midnight cortisol levels compared to normal individuals, while morning cortisol levels can be similar.
    - The HPA axis is more susceptible to suppression by glucocorticoids administered at night as they blunt the early-morning ACTH rise.
    - Understanding these rhythms allows for glucocorticoid replacement that mimics diurnal production by administering larger doses in the morning than in the afternoon.
    - Disrupted sleep rhythms can alter hormonal regulation (e.g., sleep deprivation causes mild insulin resistance, food craving, and hypertension, which are reversible).
    - Emerging evidence indicates that **circadian clock pathways** regulate sleep-wake cycles and play important roles in virtually every cell type, with tissue-specific deletion of clock genes altering rhythms and levels of gene expression, as well as metabolic responses.
- Other endocrine rhythms occur on a **more rapid time scale**.
    - Many peptide hormones are secreted in discrete bursts every few hours.
    - LH and FSH secretion are exquisitely sensitive to **GnRH pulse frequency**.
    - Intermittent GnRH pulses are required to maintain pituitary sensitivity, whereas continuous exposure to GnRH causes pituitary gonadotrope desensitization. This feature forms the basis for using long-acting GnRH agonists to treat central precocious puberty or decrease testosterone in prostate cancer management.
- It is important to be aware of the **pulsatile nature of hormone secretion** and rhythmic patterns when relating serum hormone measurements to normal values.
- **Integrated markers** have been developed to circumvent hormonal fluctuations for some hormones:
    - 24-hour urine collections for cortisol.
    - Measurement of IGF1 as a biologic marker of GH action.
    - HbA1c as an index of long-term (weeks to months) blood glucose control.
- Endocrine data must often be interpreted **in the context of other hormones**.
    - **PTH levels** are typically assessed with serum calcium concentrations: high serum calcium with elevated PTH suggests hyperparathyroidism, while suppressed PTH with hypercalcemia suggests hypercalcemia of malignancy or other causes.
    - When **T4 and T3 concentrations are low**, TSH should be elevated (due to reduced feedback inhibition). If not, secondary hypothyroidism (a pituitary defect) should be considered.

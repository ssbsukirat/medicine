## ANATOMY AND DEVELOPMENT

- The **thyroid gland** produces two hormones: **thyroxine (T4)** and **triiodothyronine (T3)**.
- These hormones act through **thyroid hormone receptors (TR) α and β**.
- They are critical for **cell differentiation** and **organogenesis** during development.
- They help maintain **thermogenic and metabolic homeostasis** in adults.
- **Autoimmune disorders** of the thyroid can cause **thyrotoxicosis** (overproduction) or **hypothyroidism** (deficiency).
- **Benign nodules** and **thyroid cancer** are common and detectable.
- **T4** contains **four iodine atoms**; deiodination produces **potent T3** or **inactive reverse T3**.
- The thyroid consists of **two lobes** connected by an **isthmus**.
- It is located **anterior to the trachea** between the cricoid cartilage and suprasternal notch.
- Normal thyroid is **12–20 g** in size, highly vascular, and soft.
- **Four parathyroid glands** are located posterior to the thyroid poles.
- **Recurrent laryngeal nerves** traverse the lateral borders and must be identified during surgery.
- The thyroid gland develops from the **floor of the primitive pharynx** during the third week of gestation.
- It migrates along the **thyroglossal duct**, explaining rare **ectopic lingual thyroid** or **thyroglossal duct cysts**.
- Thyroid hormone synthesis begins around **11 weeks’ gestation**.
- **Neural crest derivatives** form thyroid **medullary C cells**, which produce **calcitonin** (a calcium-lowering hormone).
- C cells are important for **medullary thyroid cancer**.
- Thyroid development is regulated by **developmental transcription factors** like **TTF-1, TTF-2, NKX2-1, and PAX-8**.
- These factors dictate thyroid cell development and induce thyroid-specific genes such as **thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), sodium iodide symporter (NIS), and TSH receptor (TSH-R)**.
- **Mutations** in these factors are rare causes of **thyroid agenesis or dyshormonogenesis**.
- **Congenital hypothyroidism** occurs in ~1 in 4000 newborns, leading to **neonatal screening** in industrialized countries.
- **Transplacental passage of maternal thyroid hormone** supports the fetus before fetal gland function.
- **Early thyroid hormone replacement** prevents severe developmental abnormalities in newborns.
- The thyroid consists of **spherical follicles** composed of follicular cells surrounding **colloid**.
- Colloid is a proteinaceous fluid containing large amounts of **thyroglobulin (Tg)**, the hormone precursor.
- Follicular cells are **polarized**, with a basolateral surface to the bloodstream and an apical surface to the lumen.
- **TSH** regulates demand for thyroid hormone by binding to its receptor on the basolateral surface.
- TSH binding leads to **Tg reabsorption** from the lumen, **proteolysis** within the cytoplasm, and release of hormones into the bloodstream.

## REGULATION OF THE THYROID AXIS

- **TSH** is secreted by **thyrotrope cells** of the anterior pituitary.
- It is a **pivotal control** for the thyroid axis and the most useful physiologic marker of thyroid hormone action.
- TSH is a **31-kDa hormone** composed of α and β subunits; the β subunit is unique to TSH.
- The thyroid axis is a **classic endocrine feedback loop**.
- **Hypothalamic TRH** stimulates pituitary TSH production.
- **TSH** stimulates thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion.
- **Thyroid hormones** (T4, T3) provide **negative feedback** (predominantly via **TRβ2**) to inhibit TRH and TSH production.
- The **“set point”** in this axis is established by TSH.
- **TRH** is the major **positive regulator** of TSH synthesis and secretion.
- **Reduced thyroid hormone levels** increase basal TSH production and enhance TRH-mediated stimulation.
- **High thyroid hormone levels** rapidly suppress TSH gene expression and inhibit TRH stimulation.
- TSH is released **pulsatile** and exhibits a **diurnal rhythm** (highest at night).
- Due to TSH's **relatively long plasma half-life (50 min)**, single measurements are adequate.
- TSH is measured using **highly sensitive and specific immunoradiometric assays**.
- These assays distinguish normal from suppressed TSH, aiding diagnosis of **primary hyperthyroidism (low TSH)**or **primary hypothyroidism (high TSH)**.

## THYROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS, METABOLISM, AND ACTION

### THYROID HORMONE SYNTHESIS

- Thyroid hormones are derived from **Tg (thyroglobulin)**, a large iodinated glycoprotein.
- Tg is iodinated on tyrosine residues and then coupled via an ether linkage.
- **Reuptake of Tg** into the follicular cell allows proteolysis and release of T4 and T3.

#### Iodine Metabolism and Transport

- **Iodide uptake** is a critical first step.
- The thyroid gland extracts iodine from circulation **highly efficiently** (e.g., 10–25% tracer uptake normally, 70–90% in Graves’ disease).
- Uptake is mediated by **NIS (sodium iodide symporter)**, expressed at the basolateral membrane of follicular cells.
- NIS is most highly expressed in the thyroid, with low levels in salivary glands, lactating breast, and placenta.
- Iodide transport is **highly regulated**: low iodine increases NIS, high iodine suppresses NIS.
- NIS's selective expression allows **isotopic scanning, hyperthyroidism treatment, and thyroid cancer ablation**with radioisotopes of iodine.
- **Mutation of the NIS gene** is a rare cause of congenital hypothyroidism.
- **Pendrin**, another iodine transporter on the apical surface, mediates iodine efflux.
- **Mutation of the pendrin gene** causes **Pendred syndrome**: defective iodine organification, goiter, and sensorineural deafness.
- **Iodine deficiency** is prevalent globally (e.g., central Africa, northern Asia, Europe mildly deficient, falling intake in US/Australia).
- The WHO estimates **2 billion people are iodine-deficient**.
- Severe deficiency causes **goiter, hypothyroidism, and cretinism**.
- **Cretinism** is characterized by **intellectual disability and growth retardation**.
- **Iodine supplementation** of salt/food has markedly reduced cretinism.
- Iodine deficiency remains the most common cause of **preventable intellectual disability**.
- Mild deficiency can lead to **subtle reduction of IQ**.
- **Oversupply of iodine** is associated with increased autoimmune thyroid disease.
- **Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)**: 220 μg/day for pregnant women, 290 μg/day for breastfeeding women.
- American Thyroid Association recommends all pregnant/breastfeeding US/Canada women take a prenatal multivitamin with **150 μg iodine/day**.
- Adequate iodine intake in school-age children corresponds to median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) values in the range **100-299 μg/L**.
- Urinary iodine is >100 μg/L in iodine-sufficient populations.

#### Organification, Coupling, Storage, and Release

- Trapped iodide is oxidized in an **organification reaction** involving **TPO** and **hydrogen peroxide** at the apical membrane.
- Reactive iodine is added to **tyrosyl residues within Tg**.
- Iodotyrosines in Tg are then **coupled via an ether linkage**, also catalyzed by TPO, to produce T4 or T3.
- Tg is then taken back into the thyroid cell and processed in **lysosomes** to release T4 and T3.
- Uncoupled mono- and diiodotyrosines (MIT, DIT) can be **deiodinated by dehalogenase** to recycle iodide.
- **Disorders of thyroid hormone synthesis** are rare causes of congenital hypothyroidism, mostly due to recessive mutations in TPO or Tg.
- Biosynthetic defects lead to **increased TSH and a large goiter**.

#### TSH Action

- TSH regulates thyroid function through the **TSH-R**, a **G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR)**.
- TSH-R activates **adenylyl cyclase**, leading to increased **cAMP**, and stimulates **phosphatidylinositol turnover**.
- **Recessive loss-of-function TSH-R mutations** cause thyroid hypoplasia and congenital hypothyroidism.
- **Dominant gain-of-function mutations** cause sporadic/familial hyperthyroidism with goiter and autonomous function.
- Activating mutations mimic conformational changes induced by TSH binding or **thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs)** in Graves’ disease.
- **Somatic activating TSH-R mutations** can lead to autonomously functioning thyroid nodules.

#### Other Factors That Influence Hormone Synthesis and Release

- **Growth factors** (e.g., **IGF-1, epidermal growth factor, TGF-β, endothelins, cytokines**) produced locally also influence thyroid hormone synthesis.
- In **acromegaly**, increased growth hormone and IGF-1 are associated with **goiter** and predisposition to **multinodular goiter (MNG)**.
- Certain **cytokines/interleukins** from autoimmune thyroid disease induce thyroid growth, while others cause apoptosis.
- **Iodine deficiency** increases thyroid blood flow and upregulates NIS.
- **Excess iodide** transiently inhibits iodide organification (the **Wolff-Chaikoff effect**).
- In normal individuals, the gland escapes this inhibition; however, it may persist in patients with underlying autoimmune thyroid disease.

## THYROID FUNCTION IN PREGNANCY

- **Five factors alter thyroid function in pregnancy**: transient increase in hCG, estrogen-induced rise in TBG, immune system alterations, increased placental type III deiodinase metabolism, and increased urinary iodide excretion.
- Women with **precarious iodine intake (<50 μg/d)** are most at risk of developing goiter or giving birth to an infant with goiter and hypothyroidism.
- The **WHO recommends 250 μg iodine/day** during pregnancy and lactation, and prenatal vitamins should contain 150 μg per tablet.
- The **rise in circulating hCG levels** during the first trimester causes a **reciprocal fall in TSH** that persists into mid-pregnancy.
- This can result in **transient gestational hyperthyroidism**, sometimes associated with **hyperemesis gravidarum**.
- **Antithyroid drugs are not indicated** for transient gestational hyperthyroidism unless Graves’ disease is suspected.
- **Normative values for thyroid function tests differ during pregnancy**; trimester-specific reference ranges should be used.
- **TSH levels decrease** at the end of the first trimester and then rise, allowing nonpregnant ranges from mid-gestation.
- **Total T4 and T3 levels are ~1.5x higher** throughout pregnancy.
- **Free T4** progressively decreases in the third trimester, often falling below nonpregnant lower reference cutoff.
- **Subclinical hypothyroidism** occurs in 2% of pregnant women, overt in 1 in 500.
- **Universal thyroid disease screening** in pregnancy has not shown benefit in trials.
- **Targeted TSH testing** is recommended for women planning pregnancy with certain risk factors ==(e.g., family history of autoimmune thyroid disease, other autoimmune disorders, infertility, prior preterm delivery, recurrent miscarriage, age >30 years).==
- Thyroid hormone requirements are **increased by up to 45%** during pregnancy in levothyroxine-treated hypothyroid women.

### THYROID HORMONE TRANSPORT AND METABOLISM

#### Serum-Binding Proteins

- **T4 is secreted in ~twentyfold excess over T3**.
- Both hormones are bound to plasma proteins: **thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin (TTR), and albumin**.
- Binding proteins increase the circulating hormone pool, delay clearance, and may modulate delivery.
- **TBG** carries ~**80% of bound hormones** due to its high affinity (T4 > T3).
- **Albumin** binds up to **10% of T4 and 30% of T3** due to its high concentration.
- **TTR** carries ~**10% of T4** but little T3.
- Approximately **99.98% of T4 and 99.7% of T3 are protein-bound**.
- The **unbound or “free” concentrations** of the hormones are considered **biologically available** to tissues.
- ![[t3vst4.png]]
- Homeostatic mechanisms regulate the thyroid axis to maintain **normal concentrations of unbound hormones**.

#### Abnormalities of Thyroid Hormone–Binding Proteins

- **X-linked TBG deficiency** results in very low total T4 and T3, but **normal unbound hormone levels** and euthyroidism.
- **TBG levels are elevated by estrogen** (e.g., pregnancy, oral contraceptives), increasing total T4 and T3 but with **normal unbound levels**. This explains increased L-thyroxine needs in pregnant/estrogen-treated hypothyroid women.
- **Mutations in TBG, TTR, and albumin** can increase binding affinity, causing **euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia** or **familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (FDH)**, where total T4/T3 are increased but **unbound hormone levels are normal**.
- Certain medications (e.g., **salicylates, salsalate**) can **displace thyroid hormones** from binding proteins.
	- increasing free thyroid hormone levels, TSH is suppressed until a new steady state is reached, thereby restoring euthyroidism. Circulating factors associated with acute illness may also displace thyroid hormone from binding proteins

#### Deiodinases

- **T4** is a precursor for the **more potent T3**.
- T4 is converted to T3 by **deiodinase enzymes**.
- **Type I deiodinase** is primarily in the thyroid, liver, and kidneys.
- **Type II deiodinase** is in the pituitary gland, brain, brown fat, and thyroid; it regulates local T3 concentrations. **Hypothyroidism induces type II deiodinase**, enhancing T4 → T3 conversion in tissues like the brain and pituitary.
- T4 → T3 conversion is impaired by **fasting, systemic illness, trauma, oral contrast agents, and certain medications** (e.g., propylthiouracil, propranolol, amiodarone, glucocorticoids).
- **Type III deiodinase inactivates T4 and T3** and is the main source of **reverse T3 (rT3)**, including in sick euthyroid syndrome. It is activated in muscle and liver during sick euthyroid syndrome.
- Massive hemangiomas and other tumors expressing type III deiodinase are a rare cause of consumptive hypothyroidism.

#### THYROID HORMONE ACTION

- Circulating thyroid hormones enter cells via **passive diffusion** and **specific transporters** (e.g., MCT8, MCT10, OATP1C1).
- **MCT8 gene mutations** are linked to X-linked psychomotor retardation and thyroid function abnormalities (low T4, high T3, high TSH).
- Thyroid hormones act primarily through **nuclear receptors**, but also have nongenomic actions.

##### Nuclear Thyroid Hormone Receptors

- Thyroid hormones bind with high affinity to **nuclear TRs α and β**.
- **TRα** is abundant in brain, kidneys, gonads, muscle, and heart.
- **TRβ** expression is high in the pituitary and liver.
- The **TRβ2 isoform** is selectively expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary, playing a role in feedback control.
- TRs contain a **DNA-binding domain** and a **ligand-binding domain**.
- They bind to **thyroid response elements (TREs)** in target genes as homodimers or, more commonly, **heterodimers with retinoic acid X receptors (RXRs)**.
- Activated receptors can **stimulate or inhibit gene transcription**.
- In the **absence of hormone**, TRs bind **co-repressor (CoR) proteins** that silence gene expression.
- **T3 binding dissociates CoR** and allows recruitment of **co-activators (CoA)**, altering gene expression.
- **T3 binds with 10–15 times greater affinity than T4**, explaining its increased potency.

##### Thyroid Hormone Resistance

- **Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH)** is an autosomal dominant disorder with **elevated thyroid hormone levels**and **inappropriately normal or elevated TSH**.
- Patients generally **do not show typical hypothyroidism signs** due to partial resistance compensated by higher hormone levels.
- Clinical features can include **goiter, attention deficit disorder, mild IQ reduction, delayed skeletal maturation, tachycardia, and impaired metabolic responses**.
- **Classical RTH** is caused by mutations in the **TRβ gene**, leading to loss of receptor function.
- These mutant receptors act as **antagonists** to normal TRs (dominant negative activity).
- Diagnosis is suspected by **increased unbound thyroid hormone levels without TSH suppression**.
- **DNA sequence analysis of the TRβ gene** provides definitive diagnosis.
- In most cases, **no treatment is indicated**; diagnosis helps avoid inappropriate treatment and for genetic counseling.
- A distinct form of RTH is caused by mutations in the **TRα gene**, presenting with **congenital hypothyroidism features** like growth retardation and severe constipation.
- TRα mutations show **normal TSH, low or normal T4, and normal or elevated T3**.
- **Thyroxine treatment** may alleviate some clinical manifestations for TRα mutations.

## PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

- The examination includes the **thyroid itself** and a search for **signs of abnormal thyroid function**, including extrathyroidal features like ophthalmopathy and dermopathy.
- Inspection of the neck notes surgical scars, masses, or distended veins.
- The thyroid is **palpated with both hands** from behind or while facing the patient.
- Thyroid size (normally **12–20 g**), consistency, nodularity, tenderness, and fixation should be noted.
- **Ultrasound imaging** provides the most accurate measurement of thyroid volume and nodularity, but is **not indicated if the physical exam is normal**.
- A **bruit or thrill** over the gland indicates **increased vascularity**, as seen in hyperthyroidism.
- If lower borders are not felt, a **retrosternal goiter** may be present, which can cause venous distention and difficulty breathing (**Pemberton’s sign**).
- **Thyroglossal cysts** move upward when the tongue is extended.
- Assessment for **lymphadenopathy** in the supraclavicular and cervical regions is essential.

## LABORATORY EVALUATION

### Measurement of Thyroid Hormones

- **TSH assays** have greatly improved thyroid function assessment due to their enhanced sensitivity and specificity.
- A **normal TSH level generally excludes primary thyroid dysfunction**.
- **Immunochemiluminometric assays (ICMAs)** for TSH are sensitive enough to discriminate suppressed values.
- **Biotin supplements** can interfere with TSH measurement, leading to **falsely low TSH** and **falsely high T4 or T3**; patients should stop biotin for at least 2 days before testing.
- An **abnormal TSH** requires measurement of **circulating thyroid hormone levels** to confirm diagnosis.
- Measuring **free, or unbound, hormone levels** is useful as they represent the biologically available hormone pool.
- **Direct methods** for unbound hormones include competition assays and physical separation (ultracentrifugation, equilibrium dialysis).
- **Total thyroid hormone levels** are influenced by factors like **estrogen** (increasing TBG and total levels) and **androgens** (decreasing TBG and total levels).
- Drugs like **salicylates** can displace thyroid hormones from binding proteins.
- **Assays that measure unbound hormone are preferable** as they reflect the euthyroid state in these circumstances.
- **Unbound T4** is usually sufficient, but **unbound T3** should be measured if TSH is suppressed but unbound T4 is normal (T3 toxicosis).
- **TSH screening may be misleading** in severe nonthyroidal illness, TSH-secreting pituitary tumors, thyroid hormone resistance, and secondary hypothyroidism.
- **Suppressed TSH (<0.01 mIU/L) usually indicates thyrotoxicosis**, but subnormal levels (0.01-0.1 mIU/L) can be seen in first trimester pregnancy (hCG effect), after hyperthyroidism treatment, or due to certain medications (glucocorticoids, dopamine).
- TSH should **not be used as an isolated test** in patients with suspected or known hypothalamic or pituitary disease.
- Tests for end-organ effects (e.g., basal metabolic rate, tendon reflex relaxation, serum cholesterol) are insensitive and not useful clinical determinants.

### Tests to Determine the Etiology of Thyroid Dysfunction

- **Autoimmune thyroid disease** is detected by measuring antibodies against **TPO and Tg**.
- **TPO antibodies** are found in almost all patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism and up to 80% of Graves’ disease patients.
- **TSIs (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins)** stimulate the TSH-R in Graves’ disease and are measured by **TRAb (TSH receptor antibody) assays**.
- TRAb assay predicts **fetal and neonatal thyrotoxicosis** due to transplacental passage of high maternal TRAb/TSI levels.
- **Serum Tg levels** are increased in most types of thyrotoxicosis (except factitia) and particularly in **thyroiditis**.
- The main role of Tg measurement is in **follow-up of thyroid cancer patients**; levels <0.2 ng/mL indicate complete ablation.

### Radioiodine Uptake and Thyroid Scanning

- The thyroid gland selectively transports **radioisotopes of iodine** and **99mTc pertechnetate**, allowing imaging and quantitation of uptake.
- **Graves’ disease** shows an enlarged gland with **increased, homogeneously distributed tracer uptake**.
- **Toxic adenomas** appear as focal areas of increased uptake with suppressed uptake in the rest of the gland.
- **Toxic MNG** shows multiple areas of increased or decreased uptake.
- **Thyroiditis** (subacute, viral, postpartum) and **thyrotoxicosis factitia** are associated with **very low uptake**.
- **Thyroid scintigraphy is not routine for nodules** but is performed if **serum TSH is subnormal** to check for functioning nodules.
- **Functioning ("hot") nodules are almost never malignant** and do not require fine-needle aspiration (FNA).
- **Non-functioning ("cold") nodules** are more likely to be malignant (~5–10%).
- **Whole-body and thyroid scanning (WBS)** is used in thyroid cancer treatment and surveillance.

### Thyroid Ultrasound

- **Ultrasonography is the most valuable tool** for diagnosis and evaluation of nodular thyroid disease.
- Guidelines recommend it for all patients suspected of thyroid nodules.
- It allows characterization of nodules and cysts >3mm with excellent resolution.
- **Sonographic patterns highly suggestive of malignancy** include hypoechoic solid nodules with infiltrative borders and microcalcifications (>90% cancer risk).
- **Patterns suggesting benignity** include spongiform nodules or simple cysts (<3% cancer risk).
- These patterns are incorporated into **validated risk stratification systems (RSSs)** like ACR TI-RADS.
- These systems reduce unnecessary FNAs by recommending **no FNA for spongiform nodules**.
- Ultrasound is useful for **monitoring nodule size** and **ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy**, which lowers inadequate sampling and false-negative rates.
- **Ultrasonography of cervical lymph nodes** is indispensable for evaluating thyroid cancer patients.

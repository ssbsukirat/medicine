Here are notes from the provided chapter:

# Thyrotoxicosis

- **Thyrotoxicosis** is defined as the state of **thyroid hormone excess**.
- It is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism, which results from excessive thyroid function.
- Major etiologies include hyperthyroidism caused by **Graves’ disease**, toxic multinodular goiter (MNG), and toxic adenomas.
- Other causes are listed in Table 384-1.

# Graves’ Disease

## Epidemiology

- Accounts for **60–80% of thyrotoxicosis**.
- Prevalence varies, reflecting genetic factors and iodine intake (high iodine intake increases prevalence).
- Occurs in up to **2% of women** but is one-tenth as frequent in men.
- Rarely begins before adolescence, typically occurs between **20 and 50 years of age**, and also in the elderly.

## Pathogenesis

- A combination of **environmental and genetic factors** contributes to susceptibility.
    - **Genetic factors** include polymorphisms in HLA-DR, immunoregulatory genes (CTLA-4, CD25, PTPN22, FCRL3, CD226), and the TSH receptor (TSH-R) gene.
    - Concordance is **20–30% in monozygotic twins** vs. <5% in dizygotic twins.
    - **Environmental factors** include stress, smoking (major risk for ophthalmopathy), sudden increases in iodine intake, and a threefold increase in the postpartum period.
    - May occur during immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), alemtuzumab, or immune checkpoint inhibitors.
- The hyperthyroidism is caused by **thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs)**, synthesized by lymphocytes in the thyroid gland, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.
- **TSH receptor antibody (TRAb)** immunoassays detect antibodies that displace TSH or monoclonal TSH receptor antibody from the TSH receptor.
    - TRAb presence implies TSI and is useful for **monitoring pregnant Graves’ patients** as high TSI levels can cross the placenta and cause neonatal thyrotoxicosis.
- Other thyroid autoimmune responses, like TPO and Tg antibodies, occur in up to 80% of cases.
- There is no direct correlation between TSI levels and thyroid hormone levels due to coexisting thyroiditis.
- **Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy**:
    - **Cytokines** (IFN-γ, TNF, IL-1) play a major role, leading to fibroblast activation and increased glycosaminoglycan synthesis that traps water, causing muscle swelling.
    - Activated T cells infiltrate extraocular muscles.
    - Late in the disease, there is **irreversible fibrosis** of the muscles.
    - Increased fat also contributes to retrobulbar tissue expansion.
    - Increased intraorbital pressure can lead to **proptosis, diplopia, and optic neuropathy**.
    - TSH-R is a thyroid autoantigen expressed in orbital tissues.
    - Aberrant signaling via insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors (IGF-1R) on orbital fibroblasts is implicated.
    - These mechanisms are the basis for new monoclonal antibody treatments (e.g., **teprotumumab**).

## Clinical Manifestations

- Include features common to any cause of thyrotoxicosis and those specific to Graves’ disease.
- Presentation depends on severity, duration, individual susceptibility, and patient age.
- In the elderly, features may be subtle or masked, primarily presenting as fatigue and weight loss, known as **apathetic thyrotoxicosis**.
- **Signs and Symptoms of Thyrotoxicosis (Descending Order of Frequency)**:
    - **Unexplained weight loss** despite enhanced appetite (due to increased metabolic rate); weight gain in 5%.
    - **Hyperactivity, nervousness, and irritability**, leading to easy fatigability.
    - Insomnia and impaired concentration are common; apathetic thyrotoxicosis may be mistaken for depression in the elderly.
    - **Fine tremor** is frequent.
    - Neurologic manifestations: hyperreflexia, muscle wasting, proximal myopathy (without fasciculation); chorea is rare.
    - Sometimes associated with **hypokalemic periodic paralysis**, particularly common in Asian males.
- **Cardiovascular manifestations**:
    - Most common is **sinus tachycardia**, often with palpitations, occasionally supraventricular tachycardia.
    - High cardiac output produces a bounding pulse, widened pulse pressure, and an aortic systolic murmur.
    - Can lead to worsening of angina or heart failure in the elderly or those with preexisting heart disease.
    - **Atrial fibrillation** is more common in patients >50 years of age.
    - Treatment of thyrotoxicosis alone converts atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm in about half of patients.
- **Skin, Hair, GI, Reproductive, Bone**:
    - Skin is usually **warm and moist**; patient may complain of sweating and heat intolerance.
    - **Palmar erythema, onycholysis**, and less commonly pruritus, urticaria, and diffuse hyperpigmentation may be evident.
    - Hair texture may become fine; **diffuse alopecia** occurs in up to 40%.
    - Decreased gastrointestinal transit time leads to increased stool frequency, often with diarrhea and occasionally mild steatorrhea.
    - Women frequently experience **oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea**; men may have impaired sexual function and, rarely, gynecomastia.
    - Direct effect of thyroid hormones on bone resorption leads to **osteopenia** in long-standing thyrotoxicosis.
    - Mild **hypercalcemia** in up to 20%; hypercalciuria more common.
    - Small increase in fracture rate with previous thyrotoxicosis.
- **Graves’ Disease specific features**:
    - **Thyroid** is usually **diffusely enlarged** (2–3 times normal size), firm but not nodular.
    - May have a **thrill or bruit** due to increased vascularity and hyperdynamic circulation.
    - **Lid retraction** (staring appearance) can occur in any thyrotoxicosis due to sympathetic overactivity.
    - **Graves’ ophthalmopathy (thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy)**:
        - Specific eye signs that occur in 10% of patients in the absence of hyperthyroidism (euthyroid ophthalmopathy).
        - Most such individuals have autoimmune hypothyroidism or thyroid antibodies.
        - Onset typically within one year before or after thyrotoxicosis diagnosis in 75%.
        - About **one-third of patients** have clinical evidence of ophthalmopathy.
        - Enlarged extraocular muscles detectable by ultrasound or CT imaging in most.
        - Unilateral signs found in up to 10%.
        - Earliest manifestations: sensation of **grittiness, eye discomfort, and excess tearing**.
        - About one-third have **proptosis** (sclera visible between lower iris and lower eyelid).
        - Severe proptosis may cause corneal exposure and damage.
        - **Periorbital edema, scleral injection, and chemosis** are frequent.
        - **Diplopia** in 5–10% due to muscle swelling.
        - Most serious manifestation: **compression of the optic nerve**, leading to papilledema, peripheral field defects, and permanent vision loss if untreated.
        - The **“NO SPECS” scoring system** for ophthalmopathy describes changes: No signs or symptoms (0), Only signs (1), Soft tissue involvement (2), Proptosis (>22 mm) (3), Extraocular muscle involvement (4), Corneal involvement (5), Sight loss (6).
        - NO SPECS is a mnemonic but inadequate for full description; alternative systems like EUGOGO are preferable for monitoring and treatment.
        - Active and severe Graves’ eye disease requires referral to an ophthalmologist and objective measurements.
    - **Thyroid dermopathy** occurs in **<5%** of Graves’ patients, almost always with moderate or severe ophthalmopathy.
        - Most frequent over anterior and lateral aspects of the lower leg (**pretibial myxedema**).
        - Typical lesion: **noninflamed, indurated plaque** with deep pink/purple color and an “orange skin” appearance.
        - Can rarely extend over the whole lower leg and foot, mimicking elephantiasis.
    - **Thyroid acropachy** (a form of clubbing) found in **<1%** of patients, strongly associated with thyroid dermopathy.
    - Incidence of ophthalmopathy, dermopathy, and acropachy has declined, likely due to better recognition and prompt treatment of thyroid disease.

## Laboratory Evaluation

- **TSH level is suppressed**, and total and unbound thyroid hormone levels are increased.
- In 2–5% of patients (more in borderline iodine intake areas), only T3 is increased (**T3 toxicosis**).
- T4 toxicosis (elevated total and unbound T4, normal T3) is occasionally seen when hyperthyroidism is induced by excess iodine.
- Measurement of TPO antibodies or TRAb may be useful if diagnosis is unclear, but not routinely needed.
- Associated abnormalities that may cause diagnostic confusion include elevation of bilirubin, liver enzymes, and ferritin.
- Microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia may occur.

## Differential Diagnosis

- Diagnosis is straightforward in a patient with biochemically confirmed thyrotoxicosis, diffuse goiter, ophthalmopathy, and a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders.
- For patients lacking these features, diagnosis can be established by a **radionuclide (99mTc, 123I, or 131I) scan and uptake of the thyroid**.
    - This distinguishes the diffuse, high uptake of Graves’ disease from destructive thyroiditis, ectopic thyroid tissue, and factitious thyrotoxicosis, and diagnoses toxic adenoma or toxic MNG.
- **TRAb measurement** is increasingly used instead of radionuclide scanning to confirm diagnosis.
- **Color-flow Doppler ultrasonography** may distinguish between hyperthyroidism (increased blood flow) and destructive thyroiditis.
- **Secondary hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting pituitary tumor** presents with diffuse goiter, nonsuppressed TSH, and a pituitary tumor on CT or MRI scan.
- Clinical features of thyrotoxicosis can mimic panic attacks, mania, pheochromocytoma, and malignancy-associated weight loss.
- Thyrotoxicosis is excluded if TSH and unbound T4 and T3 levels are normal.
- A normal TSH also excludes Graves’ disease as a cause of diffuse goiter.

## Clinical Course

- Clinical features generally **worsen without treatment**; mortality was 10–30% before satisfactory therapy.
- Some patients with mild Graves’ disease experience spontaneous relapses and remissions.
- Rarely, fluctuation between hypo- and hyperthyroidism due to changes in functional activity of TSH-R antibodies.
- About **15% of patients who enter remission** after treatment develop hypothyroidism 10–15 years later.
- The clinical course of ophthalmopathy does not follow that of the thyroid disease, though thyroid dysfunction can worsen eye signs.
- Ophthalmopathy typically worsens over the initial 3–6 months, plateaus for 12–18 months, then shows some spontaneous improvement.
- Course is more **fulminant in up to 5%** of patients, requiring intervention for optic nerve compression or corneal ulceration.
- Diplopia may appear late due to fibrosis of extraocular muscles.
- **Radioiodine treatment worsens eye disease** in a small proportion of patients (especially smokers).
- Antithyroid drugs and surgery have no adverse effects on ophthalmopathy.
- Thyroid dermopathy usually appears 1–2 years after Graves’ hyperthyroidism; may improve spontaneously.

## Treatment

- Hyperthyroidism is treated by reducing thyroid hormone synthesis (antithyroid drug) or reducing thyroid tissue (radioiodine or thyroidectomy).
- **Antithyroid drugs** are predominant in Europe, Latin America, Japan; **radioiodine** is more often first-line in North America.
- No single optimal approach; patients may require multiple treatments.
- **Antithyroid Drugs (Thionamides)**:
    - Main drugs: **propylthiouracil, carbimazole, and methimazole**.
    - All inhibit thyroid peroxidase (TPO) function, reducing oxidation and organification of iodide.
    - Also reduce thyroid antibody levels and enhance spontaneous remission rates.
    - Propylthiouracil inhibits T4 → T3 deiodination (minor benefit except in severe thyrotoxicosis); has a shorter half-life.
    - **Propylthiouracil use is limited by FDA due to hepatotoxicity**: first trimester of pregnancy, thyroid storm, and patients with minor adverse reactions to methimazole.
    - Monitoring liver function tests is recommended with propylthiouracil.
    - **Regimens**:
        - Initial dose of carbimazole or methimazole is 10–20 mg every 8 or 12 h; once-daily dosing possible after euthyroidism.
        - Propylthiouracil is 100–200 mg every 6–8 h in divided doses.
        - Lower doses may suffice in areas of low iodine intake.
        - **Titration regimen**: gradual reduction of starting dose as thyrotoxicosis improves; preferred to minimize dose and provide index of treatment response.
        - **Block-replace regimen**: high doses combined with levothyroxine (LT4) supplementation to avoid drug-induced hypothyroidism; initial antithyroid drug dose is constant, LT4 adjusted.
    - Thyroid function tests and clinical manifestations are reviewed **4–6 weeks after starting treatment**.
    - Euthyroidism usually achieved in 6–8 weeks. TSH levels often remain suppressed for months, not a sensitive index of response.
    - Usual daily maintenance doses: 2.5–10 mg carbimazole/methimazole; 50–100 mg propylthiouracil.
    - **Maximum remission rates (up to 30–60%)** achieved by 12–18 months for titration regimen (6 months for block-replace). Higher remission rates when TRAb levels are undetectable.
    - Relapse risk: younger patients, males, smokers, history of allergy, severe hyperthyroidism, large goiters.
    - Patients should be followed closely for relapse during the first year after treatment and annually thereafter.
    - **Side Effects**:
        - Common minor (1–5%): rash, urticaria, fever, arthralgia (may resolve spontaneously or with alternative drug).
        - Rare but major: **hepatitis** (especially propylthiouracil, avoid in children), **cholestasis**(methimazole/carbimazole), vasculitis, and **agranulocytosis (<1%)**.
        - Antithyroid drugs **must be stopped** and not restarted if major side effects develop.
        - Provide written instructions for agranulocytosis symptoms (sore throat, fever, mouth ulcers) and need for urgent complete blood count.
        - Prospective monitoring of blood counts is not useful.
- **Symptomatic Control (Beta Blockers)**:
    - **Propranolol** (20–40 mg every 6 h) or longer-acting selective β1 receptor blockers (atenolol) help control adrenergic symptoms, especially in early stages.
    - Useful in thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.
    - Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation should be considered (spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm often occurs with hyperthyroidism control).
    - Decreased warfarin doses are required when thyrotoxic; increased digoxin doses are often needed.
- **Radioiodine (131I)**:
    - Causes **progressive destruction of thyroid cells**; used as initial treatment or for relapses.
    - Small risk of thyrotoxic crisis (minimized by pretreatment with antithyroid drugs for at least a month).
    - Antithyroid drugs (carbimazole/methimazole) stopped 2–3 days before radioiodine; restarted 3–7 days after. Propylthiouracil stopped longer.
    - Optimal dose to achieve euthyroidism without high relapse/hypothyroidism incidence has not been successful.
    - A practical strategy is a **fixed dose based on clinical features** (severity of thyrotoxicosis, goiter size, radioiodine uptake).
    - Dosage generally ranges between 370 MBq (10 mCi) and 555 MBq (15 mCi).
    - Most authorities favor thyroid ablation (vs. euthyroidism) as LT4 replacement is straightforward and most patients eventually become hypothyroid.
    - **Radiation safety precautions** are necessary in the first few days: avoid close, prolonged contact with children and pregnant women for 5–7 days.
    - Mild pain due to radiation thyroiditis may occur 1–2 weeks after treatment.
    - Hyperthyroidism can persist for 2–3 months before full effect; β-adrenergic blockers or antithyroid drugs can control symptoms during this time.
    - Persistent hyperthyroidism can be treated with a second dose (usually 6 months after first).
    - **Risk of hypothyroidism** after radioiodine is at least 10–20% in the first year and 5% per year thereafter.
    - Patients require close follow-up and annual thyroid function testing.
    - **Contraindications/Cautions**:
        - **Absolute contraindications: pregnancy and breast-feeding** (patients can conceive safely 6 months after treatment).
        - Requires caution with ophthalmopathy, especially in smokers.
        - Prednisone at the time of treatment may prevent exacerbation of ophthalmopathy, but generally avoid radioiodine in active moderate to severe eye disease.
        - Some physicians avoid radioiodine in children and adolescents due to potential malignancy risks, though a recent study found a modest increased lifetime risk of solid cancers.
- **Thyroidectomy (Total or Near-Total)**:
    - An option for patients who relapse after antithyroid drugs and prefer surgery.
    - Recommended in young individuals with very large goiter.
    - Prior to surgery, careful control of thyrotoxicosis with antithyroid drugs, followed by potassium iodide, is needed to avoid thyrotoxic crisis and reduce gland vascularity.
    - Major complications (bleeding, laryngeal edema, hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve damage) are unusual with experienced surgeons.
    - Recurrence rates <2%; hypothyroidism rate similar to radioiodine.
- **Graves’ Disease in Pregnancy**:
    - **Antithyroid drugs** should be used.
    - Maternal antithyroid dose titration should target serum free or total T4 levels at or just above the pregnancy reference range to prevent fetal hypothyroidism/goiter.
    - **Propylthiouracil (PTU)** used until 14–16 weeks’ gestation due to rare methimazole/carbimazole embryopathy (aplasia cutis, choanal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistulae).
    - Recent recommendations suggest discontinuing antithyroid medication in newly pregnant euthyroid women on low doses after evaluating history, goiter size, duration of therapy, and TRAb.
    - If discontinuing is high risk, continued therapy with PTU in the first trimester is necessary.
    - Convert from PTU to methimazole (or carbimazole) after the first trimester due to PTU's rare association with hepatotoxicity.
    - Treatment can often be stopped in the last trimester as TSIs tend to decline.
    - **Fetal or neonatal thyrotoxicosis** is rare but can occur from transplacental transfer of TSIs (if levels are three times normative range).
        - Signs include poor intrauterine growth, fetal heart rate >160 beats/min, advanced bone age, fetal goiter, and high maternal TSI after 26 weeks’ gestation.
        - Treated by antithyroid drugs given to the mother; may be needed for the baby 1–3 months after delivery.
    - The **postpartum period is a time of major risk for relapse** of Graves’ disease.
    - **Breast-feeding is safe with low doses of antithyroid drugs**.
- **Graves’ Disease in Children**:
    - Usually managed initially with **methimazole or carbimazole** (avoid propylthiouracil) via a prolonged titration regimen.
    - Surgery or radioiodine may be indicated for severe or relapsing disease.
- **Thyrotoxic Crisis (Thyroid Storm)**:
    - Rare, life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism, accompanied by **fever, delirium, seizures, coma, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice**.
    - **Mortality rate is as high as 30%** (due to cardiac failure, arrhythmia, or hyperthermia).
    - Usually precipitated by acute illness, surgery, or radioiodine treatment of partially treated or untreated hyperthyroidism.
    - **Management**: intensive monitoring, supportive care, identification/treatment of precipitating cause, and measures to reduce thyroid hormone synthesis.
        - **Propylthiouracil (PTU)**: Large doses (500–1000 mg loading, 250 mg every 4 h) are the drug of choice due to its inhibitory action on T4 → T3 conversion.
        - If PTU unavailable, methimazole (20 mg every 6 h) can be used.
        - One hour after first PTU dose, **stable iodide** (5 drops SSKI every 6 h) is given to block thyroid hormone synthesis.
        - **Propranolol** (60–80 mg PO every 4 h, or 2 mg IV every 4 h) to reduce tachycardia and adrenergic manifestations; high doses decrease T4 → T3 conversion.
        - **Glucocorticoids** (e.g., hydrocortisone 300 mg IV bolus, then 100 mg every 8 h).
        - Additional measures: antibiotics (if infection), cholestyramine, cooling, oxygen, IV fluids.
- **Ophthalmopathy Treatment**:
    - Mild or moderate ophthalmopathy usually requires no active treatment and shows spontaneous improvement.
    - General measures: meticulous control of thyroid hormone levels, cessation of smoking, explanation of natural history.
    - Discomfort relieved with artificial tears, eye ointment, dark glasses.
    - Periorbital edema may respond to upright sleeping position or a diuretic.
    - Corneal exposure avoided by patches or taping eyelids shut.
    - Minor diplopia improves with prisms. Some advocate selenium.
    - **Severe ophthalmopathy** (optic nerve involvement, corneal damage) is an emergency requiring joint management with an ophthalmologist.
    - **Pulse IV methylprednisolone** is preferred for moderately active disease.
    - If glucocorticoids are ineffective, **orbital decompression surgery** can be performed.
    - External beam radiotherapy has unclear efficacy and is reserved for those who failed or are not candidates for glucocorticoids.
    - **Teprotumumab**, a human monoclonal antibody, was FDA approved in 2020 for active thyroid eye disease, showing rapid effects on proptosis, diplopia, and quality of life.
- **Thyroid Dermopathy Treatment**:
    - Does not usually require treatment; surgical removal is not indicated.
    - If necessary, treatment consists of topical, high-potency glucocorticoid ointment under an occlusive dressing.
    - Octreotide may be beneficial.

# Other Causes of Thyrotoxicosis

- **Destructive thyroiditis (subacute or silent thyroiditis)**: typically presents with a short thyrotoxic phase due to release of preformed thyroid hormones and catabolism of Tg.
    - True hyperthyroidism is absent, demonstrated by **low radionuclide uptake**.
    - Circulating Tg levels are typically increased.
- **Other causes with low or absent thyroid radionuclide uptake**:
    - **Thyrotoxicosis factitia**.
    - **Iodine excess**.
    - Rarely, **ectopic thyroid tissue**, particularly teratomas of the ovary (struma ovarii) and functional metastatic follicular carcinoma.
    - Whole-body radionuclide studies can demonstrate ectopic thyroid tissue.
    - Thyrotoxicosis factitia can be distinguished from destructive thyroiditis by clinical features and low levels of Tg.
    - **Amiodarone treatment** is associated with thyrotoxicosis in up to 10% of patients.
- **TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma**:
    - Rare cause of thyrotoxicosis.
    - Characterized by inappropriately normal or increased TSH level with hyperthyroidism, diffuse goiter, and elevated T4 and T3.
    - Elevated levels of the α subunit of TSH support diagnosis.
    - Confirmed by demonstrating pituitary tumor on MRI or CT scan.
    - Treatment: combination of transsphenoidal surgery, sella irradiation, and octreotide may be required.
    - Radioiodine or antithyroid drugs can control thyrotoxicosis.
- Thyrotoxicosis caused by toxic MNG and hyperfunctioning solitary nodules is discussed elsewhere.

# Thyroiditis

- Several classification systems exist based on onset/duration or presence/absence of pain.

## Acute Thyroiditis

- Rare, due to **suppurative infection of the thyroid**.
- Most common cause in children/young adults is a **piriform sinus** (remnant of fourth branchial pouch).
- Risk factors in elderly: long-standing goiter and degeneration in thyroid malignancy.
- Presents with **thyroid pain** (often referred to throat or ears), and a small, tender goiter (may be asymmetric).
- Common: fever, dysphagia, erythema over thyroid, systemic febrile illness, lymphadenopathy.
- Differential diagnosis includes subacute or chronic thyroiditis, hemorrhage into a cyst, malignancy, amiodarone-induced thyroiditis, and amyloidosis.
- Abrupt presentation and clinical features rarely cause confusion.
- **Laboratory**: ESR and white cell count usually increased; **thyroid function is normal**.
- **FNA biopsy** shows infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes; culture identifies organism.
- Caution in immunocompromised patients (fungal, mycobacterial, Pneumocystis thyroiditis).
- Treatment: antibiotic guided by Gram stain and cultures.
- Surgery may be needed to drain an abscess.
- Complications (tracheal obstruction, septicemia) are uncommon with prompt antibiotics.

## Subacute Thyroiditis

- Also termed **de Quervain’s thyroiditis, granulomatous thyroiditis, or viral thyroiditis**.
- Many viruses implicated (mumps, coxsackie, influenza, adenoviruses, echoviruses, SARS-CoV-2).
- Diagnosis often overlooked (symptoms can mimic pharyngitis).
- Peak incidence at 30–50 years; **women affected three times more frequently** than men.

### Pathophysiology

- Thyroid shows a characteristic **patchy inflammatory infiltrate** with disruption of thyroid follicles and multinucleated giant cells.
- Follicular changes progress to granulomas accompanied by fibrosis.
- Thyroid returns to normal, usually several months after onset.
- **Initial phase**: follicular destruction releases Tg and thyroid hormones, leading to increased circulating T4 and T3 and **suppression of TSH**. Radioactive iodine uptake is low or undetectable.
- **Hypothyroid phase**: after several weeks, thyroid depleted of stored hormone, low unbound T4 (and sometimes T3) and moderately increased TSH levels. Radioactive iodine uptake returns to normal or is even increased.
- **Recovery phase**: thyroid hormone and TSH levels return to normal as disease subsides.

### Clinical Manifestations

- Patient usually presents with a **painful and enlarged thyroid**, sometimes with fever.
- May have features of thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism depending on phase.
- Malaise and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms may precede thyroid features.
- Onset can be acute, severe, and without obvious antecedent.
- Complains of a sore throat; examination reveals an **exquisitely tender small goiter**.
- Pain often referred to the jaw or ear.
- **Complete resolution is the usual outcome**.
- Late-onset permanent hypothyroidism occurs in 15% of cases.
- A prolonged course with relapses occurs in a small percentage of patients.

### Laboratory Evaluation

- Thyroid function tests evolve through three distinct phases over about 6 months: (1) thyrotoxic phase, (2) hypothyroid phase, and (3) recovery phase.
- In the **thyrotoxic phase**: T4 and T3 levels are increased, TSH is suppressed. T4/T3 ratio is greater than in Graves’ disease.
- Diagnosis confirmed by a **high ESR** and **low uptake of radioiodine (<5%)** or 99mTc pertechnetate.
- White blood cell count may be increased; **thyroid antibodies are negative**.
- FNA biopsy may be useful to distinguish unilateral involvement from bleeding into a cyst or neoplasm.

### Treatment

- Relatively large doses of **aspirin or NSAIDs** are sufficient to control symptoms in many cases.
- If inadequate, or for marked symptoms, **glucocorticoids** (prednisone 15–40 mg) tapered over 6–8 weeks are given.
- If relapse occurs during glucocorticoid withdrawal, increase dosage and withdraw more gradually.
- Thyroid function monitored every 2–4 weeks.
- Thyrotoxicosis symptoms improve spontaneously; may be ameliorated by β-adrenergic blockers; **antithyroid drugs play no role**.
- LT4 replacement may be needed if hypothyroid phase is prolonged, but doses should be low enough to allow TSH-mediated recovery.

## Silent Thyroiditis

- Also known as **painless thyroiditis**.
- Occurs in patients with **underlying autoimmune thyroid disease** and has a clinical course similar to subacute thyroiditis.
- **Postpartum thyroiditis**: occurs in up to 5% of women 3–6 months after pregnancy.
- Typically: brief phase of thyrotoxicosis (2–4 weeks), followed by hypothyroidism (4–12 weeks), then resolution; often only one phase is apparent.
- Associated with the presence of **TPO antibodies antepartum**; three times more common in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
- Uptake of 99mTc pertechnetate or radioactive iodine is initially suppressed.
- Distinguished from subacute thyroiditis by a **painless goiter, normal ESR, and the presence of TPO antibodies**.
- **Glucocorticoid treatment is not indicated**.
- Severe thyrotoxic symptoms can be managed with a brief course of **propranolol**.
- Thyroxine replacement may be needed for the hypothyroid phase but should be withdrawn after 6–9 months as recovery is the rule.
- Annual follow-up recommended as a proportion develop permanent hypothyroidism.
- The condition may recur in subsequent pregnancies.

## Drug-Induced Thyroiditis

- Patients receiving cytokines (IFN-α), tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors may develop painless thyroiditis.
- IFN-α causes thyroid dysfunction in up to 5% of treated patients and has been associated with painless thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, and Graves’ disease.
- Most common in women with TPO antibodies prior to treatment with IFN-α.
- Amiodarone effects on thyroid function are discussed elsewhere.

## Chronic Thyroiditis

- **Focal thyroiditis**: present in 20–40% of euthyroid autopsy cases, associated with serologic evidence of autoimmunity (TPO antibodies).
- **Hashimoto’s thyroiditis**: most common clinically apparent cause of chronic thyroiditis; an autoimmune disorder presenting as a firm or hard goiter.
- **Riedel’s thyroiditis**: rare, typically occurs in middle-aged women.
    - Presents with an insidious, painless goiter with local symptoms due to compression of esophagus, trachea, neck veins, or recurrent laryngeal nerves.
    - Dense fibrosis disrupts normal gland architecture and can extend outside the thyroid capsule.
    - Thyroid dysfunction is uncommon despite extensive histologic changes.
    - Goiter is hard, nontender, often asymmetric, and fixed, leading to suspicion of malignancy.
    - Diagnosis requires **open biopsy** as FNA biopsy is usually inadequate.
    - Treatment is directed to surgical relief of compressive symptoms. Tamoxifen may also be beneficial.
    - Associated with IgG4-related disease causing idiopathic fibrosis at other sites.

# Sick Euthyroid Syndrome (Nonthyroidal Illness)

- Any acute, severe illness can cause **abnormalities of circulating TSH or thyroid hormone levels** in the absence of underlying thyroid disease.
- Major cause of these hormonal changes is the **release of cytokines** such as IL-6.
- Routine testing of thyroid function should be avoided in acutely ill patients unless a thyroid disorder is strongly suspected.
- Most common hormone pattern: **decrease in total and unbound T3 levels (low T3 syndrome)** with normal T4 and TSH.
    - Magnitude of T3 fall correlates with illness severity.
    - T4 conversion to T3 via peripheral 5′ deiodination is impaired, leading to increased reverse T3 (rT3).
    - Decreased clearance rather than increased production is the major basis for increased rT3.
    - T4 is also metabolized to hormonally inactive T3 sulfate.
    - Low T3 state is generally assumed to be adaptive, potentially limiting catabolism.
- **Very sick patients** may exhibit a dramatic fall in total T4 and T3 levels (**low T4 syndrome**), which has a poor prognosis.
    - Decreased tissue perfusion leads to accelerated T4 and T3 metabolism.
    - Altered binding to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a key factor in T4 fall.
    - Free T4 assays can underestimate true free T4 with low serum binding proteins.
- TSH levels may fluctuate from <0.1 mIU/L (in very ill patients, with dopamine or glucocorticoid therapy) to >20 mIU/L during recovery.
- Certain disorders exhibit distinctive patterns:
    - **Acute liver disease**: initial rise in total T3 and T4 (due to TBG release); subnormal with liver failure progression.
    - **Acutely ill psychiatric patients**: transient increase in total and unbound T4 (5–30%), usually normal T3. TSH can be low, normal, or high.
    - **Early HIV infection**: T3 and T4 levels rise; T3 levels fall with progression to AIDS, but TSH usually remains normal.
    - **Renal disease**: often low T3 concentrations, but with normal rather than increased rT3 levels.
- Diagnosis of Nonthyroidal Illness (NTI) is challenging; often presumptive.
- Treatment of NTI with thyroid hormone is controversial; most authorities recommend monitoring during recovery without administering thyroid hormone unless hypothyroidism is suspected.

# Amiodarone Effects on Thyroid Function

- **Amiodarone** is a commonly used type III antiarrhythmic agent, containing **39% iodine by weight**.
- Typical doses lead to very high iodine intake, persisting for >6 months after discontinuation due to storage in adipose tissue.
- Amiodarone inhibits deiodinase activity, and its metabolites act as weak antagonists of thyroid hormone action.
- **Effects on thyroid function**:
    1. Acute, transient suppression of thyroid function.
    2. Inhibition of T4 to T3 conversion, causing euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia or increased LT4 dosage requirement in hypothyroid patients.
    3. Hypothyroidism in patients susceptible to high iodine load inhibitory effects.
    4. Thyrotoxicosis, which may be caused by a **Jod-Basedow effect** or a thyroiditis-like condition.
- Initiation of amiodarone is associated with a transient decrease in T4, then most individuals escape iodide-dependent suppression (**Wolff-Chaikoff effect**).
- This leads to increased T4, decreased T3, increased rT3, and a transient TSH increase (up to 20 mIU/L); TSH levels normalize or are slightly suppressed within 1–3 months.
- **Amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism**:
    - Incidence varies geographically (up to 13% in iodine-replete countries, <6% in lower iodine intake areas).
    - Pathogenesis involves inability of the thyroid to escape the Wolff-Chaikoff effect in autoimmune thyroiditis.
    - More common in women and individuals with positive TPO antibodies.
    - Usually unnecessary to discontinue amiodarone as LT4 can normalize thyroid function.
- **Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT)**:
    - Complicated by different causes and exacerbation of underlying cardiac issues.
    - Occurs in 10% of patients in low iodine intake areas and 2% in high iodine intake areas.
    - Two major forms:
        1. **Type 1 AIT**: associated with underlying thyroid abnormality (preclinical Graves’ disease or nodular goiter); excessive thyroid hormone synthesis due to iodine exposure (**Jod-Basedow phenomenon**). Color-flow Doppler shows **increased vascularity**.
        2. **Type 2 AIT**: occurs in individuals with no intrinsic thyroid abnormalities; results from drug-induced lysosomal activation leading to **destructive thyroiditis**. Incidence rises with cumulative dosage. Color-flow Doppler shows **decreased vascularity**.
    - Thyroid scintiscans are difficult to interpret due to high endogenous iodine.
- **Management of AIT**:
    - Stop amiodarone if possible (often impractical). Discontinuation will not have acute effect due to prolonged half-life.
    - For **Type 1 AIT**: high doses of antithyroid drugs (often ineffective); potassium perchlorate has been used.
    - For **Type 2 AIT**: glucocorticoids (prednisone 40 mg PO daily) have modest benefit.
    - Lithium blocks thyroid hormone release and can provide some benefit.
    - **Near-total thyroidectomy** may be the most effective long-term solution if safely performed.

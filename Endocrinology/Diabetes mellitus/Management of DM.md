# Goals of therapy
* T1DM or T2DM
	* eliminate symptoms related to hyperglycemia 
	* reduce or eliminate the long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM
	* allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible
* Symptoms usually resolve when RBS <200mg/dl <11.1 mmol/L
# Ongoing aspects of *Comprehensive Diabetes Care*
* Comprehensive Diabetes Care
	* INtensive insulin therapy 
	* INtensive glycemic control
	* "Tight control "
* optimal diabetes therapy involves more than glucose management and medications 
* patient-centered and individualized as advocated by the American Diabetes Association (ADA).
* Detect and manage DM specific complications 
* Modify risk factors for DM related diseases
* Can reduce mortality and morbidity
* Individualized treatment goals
* prevent and treat hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL)

## Lifestyle Management 
###  Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES)
* improve the patient’s knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for diabetes self-care
* emphasize psychosocial issues and emotional well-being. 
* Patient education is a continuing process with regular visits for reinforcement; it is not a process completed after one or two visits.
* Important at
	* Diagnosis
	* Annually
	* when goals are not met 
	* transition in life or medical care 
* delivered by a diabetes educator who is a health care professional (nurse, dietician, or pharmacist) with specialized patient-education skills and who is certified in diabetes education (e.g., Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists).
* Includes
	* self- monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and/or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) 
	* urine or blood ketone monitoring (type 1 DM)
	* insulin administration 
	* guidelines for diabetes management during illnesses 
	* prevention and management of hypoglycemia 
	* foot and skin care
	* diabetes management before, during, and after exercise 
	* risk factor–modifying activities.

### Medical Nutrition therapy 
* #Defined as ***optimal coordination of caloric intake with other aspects of diabetes therapy (insulin, exercise, and weight loss)***
* Aims to
	* preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 DM in high-risk individuals (obese or with prediabetes) by promoting weight reduction 
	* improving glycemic control through limiting carbohydrate intake and avoiding simple sugars and fructose
	* managing diabetes- related complications (cardiovascular disease, nephropathy)
* high-quality, nutrient-dense with limits on carbohydrate intake required for glycemic control and weight management 
* *glycemic index* an estimate of the postprandial rise in the blood glucose when a certain amount of that food is consumed, may reduce postprandial glucose excursions and improve glycemic control.
* T1-DM
	* Goals 
		* coordinate and match the carbohydrate intake, both temporally and quantitatively, with the appropriate amount of insulin.
	* informed by SMBG and/or CGM
	* patient’s estimate of the carbohydrate content of a meal, an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio determines the bolus insulin dose for a meal or snack.
	* flexible enough to allow for exercise, and the insulin regimen must allow for variations in caloric intake 
	* minimize the weight gain often associated with intensive insulin therapy 
	* best achieved by placing limits on carbohydrate intake
* T2-DM
	* focus on weight loss
	* address the greatly increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity) and disease in this population.
	* emphasize modest caloric reduction, increased physical activity, and weight loss ***(goal of at least 5–10% loss)***
* Weight loss and exercise each independently improve insulin sensitivity.
* Fasting in DM
	* Under International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines on fasting during Ramadan, individuals are risk-stratified as those who can safely fast with medical evaluation and supervision and those in whom fasting is not advised. Thus, patient education and regular glucose monitoring are critical.

### Physical Activity 
* Benefits
	* cardiovascular risk reduction, 
	* reduced blood pressure, 
	* maintenance of muscle mass, 
	* reduction in body fat, 
	* weight loss
	* useful for lowering plasma glucose (during and following exercise) 
	* increasing insulin sensitivity.
* Recommendations
	* 150 mins / week
	* distributed over atleast 3 days
	* no gaps longer than 2 days
	* Moderate aerobic physical exercise 
	* Resistance, flexibility balance reduced sedentary behaviour
* Normally insulin falls and glucagon rises in exercise 
* DM patient lacks normal gluco-regulatory mechanisms
* Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements.
* DM patient during exercise  may develop 
	* Hyperglycemia or Ketoacidosis 
		* insulin level is too low, the delivery of lactate to the liver and rise in catecholamines may increase the plasma glucose excessively, promote ketone body formation, and possibly lead to ketoacidosis.
	* Hypoglycemia 
		* circulating insulin level is excessive, this relative hyperinsulinemia may reduce hepatic glucose production (decreased glycogenolysis, decreased gluconeogenesis) and increase glucose entry into muscle 
* Avoid hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia 
	* monitor blood glucose before, during, and after exercise 
	* delay exercise if blood glucose is >14 mmol/L (250 mg/ dL) and ketones are present; 
	* if the blood glucose is <5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/dL), ingest carbohydrate before exercising;
	* monitor glucose during exercise and ingest carbohydrate as needed to prevent hypoglycemia
	* decrease insulin doses (based on previous experience) before and after exercise and inject insulin into a nonexercising area
	* learn individual glucose responses to different types of exercise.
* in T2-DM exercise-related hypoglycemia is less common but can occur in individuals taking either insulin or insulin secretagogues
* Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise 
	* may lead to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment

### Psychosocial Care 
* Important part of DM care 
* Diabetes Distress
	* “...negative psychological reactions related to emotional burdens...in having to manage a chronic disease like diabetes"
* Stress may provoke a change in behaviour making adherence to plan difficult
* Eating disorders, including binge eating disorders, bulimia, and anorexia nervosa, appear to occur more frequently in individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM.
## Monitoring of glycemic control 
* the patient’s measurements provide a picture of short-term glycemic control 
* HbA1c reflects average glycemic control over the previous 2–3 months 
* Most measurements should be performed prior to a meal and supplemented with postprandial measurements to assist in reaching glucose targets

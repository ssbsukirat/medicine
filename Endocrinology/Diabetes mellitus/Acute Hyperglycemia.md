- If RBS >250 assess for stability, mentation, hydration
- may have few symptoms
- Ketones measured in type 1 if 
	- RBS>250 
	- Concurrent illness
	- Nausea vomiting or abdominal pain
- Beta hydroxybutyrate measurement better than urine nitroprusside tests 
- Both DKA AND HHS associated with 
	- Absolute to relative insulin deficiency
	- Volume depletion 
	- Acid base abnormalities
	- Continuum of Hyperglycemia

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis
## Clinical features
- ![[Dkafeautures.png]]
- Nausea vomiting common and if ***present in Diabetic must evaluate for DKA***
- Thirst polydipsia 
- Abdominal pain severe and may resemble rupture viscus 
- Shortness of breath
- Develop over 24 hours 
- Hyperglycemia causes 
	- glucosuria, 
	- volume depletion and 
	- tachycardia
- Hypotension
	- Volume depletion
	- Peripheral vasodilation
- Kussmaul respiration with fruity odour (secondary to metabolic acidosis and acetone) classical 
- Lethargy and CNS depression
	- May occur
	- May evolve to coma in severe DKA
	- If ***present must also evaluate for other causes*** like infection hypoxemia
- Cerebral edema more in children
- Look for signs of infection even in absence of fever 
## Pathophysiology
- relative to absolute insulin deficiency
- Counter-regulatory hormonal excess 
	- Glucagon
	- Catecholamines
	- Cortisol
	- Growth hormone
- Glucagon excess necessary for DKA
	- promotes gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and ketone body formation
	- Increased substrate delivery from fat and muscle  (FFAs)
- Ketosis
	- Marked increase in FFAs from liver 
	- Shift to ketosis in liver 
- Inflammatory markers (CRP, cytokines) elevated in both DKA and HHS

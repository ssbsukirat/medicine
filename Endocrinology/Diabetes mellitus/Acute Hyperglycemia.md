- If RBS >250 assess for stability, mentation, hydration
- may have few symptoms
- Ketones measured in type 1 if 
	- RBS>250 
	- Concurrent illness
	- Nausea vomiting or abdominal pain
- Beta hydroxybutyrate measurement better than urine nitroprusside tests 
- Both DKA AND HHS associated with 
	- Absolute to relative insulin deficiency
	- Volume depletion 
	- Acid base abnormalities
	- Continuum of Hyperglycemia

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis
## Clinical features
- ![[Dkafeautures.png]]
- Nausea vomiting common and if ***present in Diabetic must evaluate for DKA***
- Thirst polydipsia 
- Abdominal pain severe and may resemble rupture viscus 
- Shortness of breath
- Develop over 24 hours 
- Hyperglycemia causes 
	- glucosuria, 
	- volume depletion and 
	- tachycardia
- Hypotension
	- Volume depletion
	- Peripheral vasodilation
- Kussmaul respiration with fruity odour (secondary to metabolic acidosis and acetone) classical 
- Lethargy and CNS depression
	- May occur
	- May evolve to coma in severe DKA
	- If ***present must also evaluate for other causes*** like infection hypoxemia
- Cerebral edema more in children
- Look for signs of infection even in absence of fever 
## Pathophysiology
- relative to absolute insulin deficiency
- Counter-regulatory hormonal excess 
	- Glucagon
	- Catecholamines
	- Cortisol
	- Growth hormone
- Glucagon excess necessary for DKA
	- promotes gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis and ketone body formation
	- Increased substrate delivery from fat and muscle  (FFAs)
- Ketosis
	- Marked increase in FFAs from liver 
	- Shift to ketosis in liver 
- Inflammatory markers (CRP, cytokines) elevated in both DKA and HHS
## Labs 
- RBS>250 
	- Maybe only mildly elevated
	- Maybe normal in euglycemic DKA (sglt2 inhibitors)
- Ketosis 
- metabolic Acidosis
	- Bicarbonate<15-18
	- with high anion gap
	- 6.8-7.3  
- potassium
	- Total body deficit 
	- Maybe normal or slightly higher
		- Acidosis
		- Volume depletion
- Sodium, chloride, phosphate, magnesium reduced but not accurate as hypovolemia and hyperglycemia
- BUN and creatinine reflect volume depletion
- Leukocytosis, TGs raised, hyperlipoproteinemia 
- Lipase maybe increased
	- May suspect pancreatitis
	- But amylase of salivary origin
	- Lipase to be sure of pancreatitis 
- Sodium
	- Reduced body stores 
	- Falsely low value due to Hyperglycemia
	- 1.6 meq fall for 100mg/dL rise in RBS
	- If normal sodium reflects high sodium loss 
- Ketones 
	- Beta hydroxybutyrate is 3x as acetoacetate
	- But acetoacetate measured easier by nitroprusside tests 
	- Usually positive at 1:8 dilution
	- Captopril or penicillamine may give false positive on nitroprusside
	- Serum or plasma beta hydroxybutyrate better
- Differential
	- Starvation ketosis 
	- Alcohol Ketoacidosis (bicarbonate >15) 
	- HAGMA causes 
## Treatment
- ![[Dkamanagement.png]]
- Start IV fluids, insulin then focus on cause of DKA and evaluate
- Careful monitoring and frequent reassessment 
- After initial bolus of NS or RL, correct fluid and sodium deficit over 24 hours 
- Usual fluid deficit is 3-5 L 
- When hemodynamic stable and urine output maintained, switch to 0.45 Saline of RL as it reduces hyperchloremia in DKA
- Insulin
	- 0.1 U/Kg as bolus 
	- Continuous levels via infusion usually IV 0.1U/Kg/hour in severe or complicated
	- Mild to moderate uncomplicated can give short acting SC 
	- IV insulin till acidosis resolve and metabolic stability
	- As acidosis resolve and insulin resistance decreased, reduces IV infusion to 0.02-0.1U/kg/hour 
	- Long acting and short acting SC combination as soon as patient is eating to reduce length of stay 
	- If inadequate insulin may relapse DKA 
	- Euglycemic DKA due to SGLT2 inhibitors may have 10-14 days of effect 
- Hyperglycemia reduces by 50-100 mg/dL per hour
	- Insulin mediated disposal 
	- Reduced Hepatic glucose release
	- Rehydration
		- Reduces catecholamines
		- Urinary glucose loss 
		- Expand intravascular volume
	- May fall rapidly in 1st hour due to volume expansion
	- Add glucose to 0.45 Saline when RBS 200-250 
	- ***Maintain RBS at 150-200 with low rate insulin infusion to inhibit ketogenesis*** 
	- Rapid correction of glucose may cause cerebral edema
- Ketoacidosis
	- Resolve with insulin
	- Insulin reduces lipolysis
	- Increased peripheral ketone use 
	- Lower hepatic ketosis 
	- bicarbonate regeneration by insulin
	- Resolve slower than Hyperglycemia 
	- Anion gap may resolve before bicarb increase due to rise in chloride
- Potassium
	- Depleted (3-5meq/kg deficit)
	- Mechanism of hypokalemia
		- Insulin mediated transport into cells 
		- Resolution of acidosis
		- Urinary potassium loss 
	- Begin replacement as soon as urine output and normal serum potassium documented 
	- Delay replacement if hyperkalemia initially
	- Add 20-40 meq for every litre of IV fluids 
	- Potassium phosphate or acetate to reduce chloride administration
	- Maintain K at >3.5 
- Bicarbonate
	- Not usually replaced 
		- Impaired cardiac function
		- Reduced tissue oxygenation
		- Promotes hypokalemia 
		- Increased risk of cerebral edema
	- If pH<7.0 may replace
		- 50 mmol in 200ml of sterile water with 10meq/L KCl per hour for 2 hours till pH>7.0 
- Hypophosphatemia
	- Increased glucose usage
	- No need to replace
	- If phosphate <1mg/dL then replace and monitor serum calcium 
- Hypomagnesemia may require replacement
- Low mortality (<1%) with appropriate management
- Complications
	- Venous thromboembolism
	- Upper GI bleed
	- ARDS 
	- Cerebral edema
# Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS)

- elderly individual with T2DM with several weeks history of polyuria, weight loss and diminished oral intake culminating in mental confusion, lethargy or coma 
- Profound dehydration and hyperosmolar state 
- Hypotension tachycardia and altered mental status 
- Absent 
	- Nausea vomiting
	- Abdominal pain
	- Kussmaul respiration
- Precipitate by concurrent illness like MI or stroke, pneumonia, sepsis 
- Reduced water intake situation may contribute to development
## Pathophysiology
- Relative insulin deficiency and inadequate fluid intake 
- Insulin deficiency 
	- Hepatic glucose production 
	- Impaired glucose uptake by muscle 
- Hyperglycemia causes osmotic diuresis

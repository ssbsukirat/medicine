- Microvascular complications are diabetes- specific, whereas macrovascular complications have additional pathophysiologic features that are shared with the general population 
# Glycemic control & complications 
- microvascular complications of both type 1 and type 2 DM result from chronic hyperglycemia 
- The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)--  definitive proof that reduction in chronic hyperglycemia can prevent many complications of type 1 DM
- continuous relationship between hba1c and development of complications
- Strict HTN control benefits both micro and macro vascular complications 
- BP control more beneficial than hba1c control on UKPDS study 
- American Heart association recommended
	- 130/80 target in high CVS risk 
	- 140/90 in low risk 
- Metabolic memory
	- Early intense control is beneficial long-term even if later control is poor 
# Mechanism
- Unknown
- Chronic Hyperglycemia 
	- may lead to epigenetic changes even though it's multifactorial
	- Advanced Glycolated end products (AGEs) like pentosidine, glucosepane, carboxymethyl lysine 
	- Non-enzymatic glycosylation of intra and extracellular protein
- growth factors
	- Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) locally in diabetic retinopathy which reduces after photocoagulation and is targeted by intravitreal injections 
- Reactive oxygen species by Hyperglycemia
- Macrovascular complications
	- Both Hyperglycemia and risk factors like dyslipidemia, hypertension and insulin resistance
# Ophthalmological complications
- Leading cause of blindness in USA 
- Severe vision loss due to progressive diabetic retinopathy which causes macular edema and angiogenesis 
- Non proliferative and proliferative 
- Non proliferative
	- Late 1st decade or early second decade of Diagnosis
	- Retinal microaneurysms 
	- Blot hemorrhage
	- Cotton wool spots 
	- ![[Diabeticretinopathy.png]]
- Proliferative
	- Neovascularisation in response to chronic hypoxemia 
	- Appears near optic nerve or macula and rupture easily 
	- Vitreous hemorrhage, fibrosis and retinal detachment
	- More severe the non-proliferative, higher chance of progress to proliferative 
- Early detection plays role 
- Macular edema may be detected by fluorescein angiography and OCT (optical coherence tomography) which has 25% chance of causing moderate visual loss in 3 years 
- Best predictors are duration of DM and degree of glycemic control 
- Other risk factors
	- Hypertension
	- Nephropathy
	- Dyslipidemia
- Treatment
	- Most effective is prevention
	- May worsen in 6-12 months initially of glycemic control but it's paradoxical and reverses with time 
	- Preventive photocoagulation
		- Known retinopathy before starting intensive control 
		- Prior to pancreatic or islet cell transplantation

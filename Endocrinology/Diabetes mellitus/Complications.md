- Microvascular complications are diabetes- specific, whereas macrovascular complications have additional pathophysiologic features that are shared with the general population 
# Glycemic control & complications 
- microvascular complications of both type 1 and type 2 DM result from chronic hyperglycemia 
- The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)--  definitive proof that reduction in chronic hyperglycemia can prevent many complications of type 1 DM
- continuous relationship between hba1c and development of complications
- Strict HTN control benefits both micro and macro vascular complications 
- BP control more beneficial than hba1c control on UKPDS study 
- American Heart association recommended
	- 130/80 target in high CVS risk 
	- 140/90 in low risk 
- Metabolic memory
	- Early intense control is beneficial long-term even if later control is poor 
# Mechanism
- Unknown
- Chronic Hyperglycemia 
	- may lead to epigenetic changes even though it's multifactorial
	- Advanced Glycolated end products (AGEs) like pentosidine, glucosepane, carboxymethyl lysine 
	- Non-enzymatic glycosylation of intra and extracellular protein
- growth factors
	- Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) locally in diabetic retinopathy which reduces after photocoagulation and is targeted by intravitreal injections 
- Reactive oxygen species by Hyperglycemia
- Macrovascular complications
	- Both Hyperglycemia and risk factors like dyslipidemia, hypertension and insulin resistance
# Ophthalmological complications
- Leading cause of blindness in USA 
- Severe vision loss due to progressive diabetic retinopathy which causes macular edema and angiogenesis 
- Non proliferative and proliferative 
- Non proliferative
	- Late 1st decade or early second decade of Diagnosis
	- Retinal microaneurysms 
	- Blot hemorrhage
	- Cotton wool spots 
	- ![[Diabeticretinopathy.png]]
- Proliferative
	- Neovascularisation in response to chronic hypoxemia 
	- Appears near optic nerve or macula and rupture easily 
	- Vitreous hemorrhage, fibrosis and retinal detachment
	- More severe the non-proliferative, higher chance of progress to proliferative 
- Early detection plays role 
- Macular edema may be detected by fluorescein angiography and OCT (optical coherence tomography) which has 25% chance of causing moderate visual loss in 3 years 
- Best predictors are duration of DM and degree of glycemic control 
- Other risk factors
	- Hypertension
	- Nephropathy
	- Dyslipidemia
- Treatment
	- Most effective is prevention
	- May worsen in 6-12 months initially of glycemic control but it's paradoxical and reverses with time 
	- Preventive photocoagulation
		- Known retinopathy before starting intensive control 
		- Prior to pancreatic or islet cell transplantation 
	- Lowering triglycerides with fenofibrate will reduce progress
	- Regular comprehensive eye exams 
	- Dilated eye exams needed to diagnose properly
	- Laser photocoagulation or anti-VEGF therapy is successful
	- No role of aspirin is clear 
	- Antiplatelet and anticoagulant maybe continued with intravitreal injections also 
	- Severe proliferative DR with vitreous hemorrhage and/or traction may need surgical vitrectomy 
# Renal 
- Leading cause of CKD and ESRD
- Increased risk of CVS mortality
- Diabetic nephropathy usually have retinopathy
- Chronic Hyperglycemia implicated
	- Soluble factors (growth factors, angiotensin 2, AGEs)
	- Hemodynamic changes in renal circulation (renal hyperperfusion or hyperfiltration and increased glomerular capillary pressure)
	- Structural glomerular change (increased extracellular matrix, basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion)
- Smoking worsens 
- Genetics and family history important
- Natural history
	- 1st 5 years -- mesangial expansion, glomerular thickening as GFR returns to normal 
	- 5-10 years -- microalbuminuria (albuminuria is urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio more than 30mg/g) 
	- albuminuria may better with glycemic control or bp control with ACE/ARB blocker or SGLT2 inhibitors
	- Diabetic Kidney Disease is albuminuria with GFR<60 
	- Once marked albuminuria and reduced creatinine, pathology is mostly irreversible 
- Type 2 DM may have albuminuria at Diagnosis (unlike T1-DM) and maybe secondary to other factors like Hypertension, CHF prostate or infection
- Assessment must have urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and eGFR 5 years after T1-DM Diagnosis and at time of t2-dm Diagnosis
- Type IV RTA (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism) may occur in both 1/2 DM
	- Hyperkalemia
	- Acidemia 
	- Exacerbated by ACE ARB And mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist 
- DM patients predisposed to contrast induced nephropathy so prehydrate and monitor creatinine for 24-48 hours and hold metformin till confirmation of kidney function 
- Treatment
	- Slow progress 
		- by control of sugar 
		- Strict HTN control
		- ACE or ARB 
		- SGLT2 inhibitor in t2-dm 
	- 10-years of normoglycemia resulting from pancreas transplantation may lead to regression of mesangial glomerular lesions
	- Late phase may have reduced insulin requirement 
	- sulfonylurea and metformin contraindicated in advanced renal insufficiency while glinides and DPP-4 inhibitors need dose reduce 
	- ACE or ARB 
		- reduce albuminuria and decline in GFR 
		- equivalent 
		- ARBs if ACE inhibitors cause cough or angioedema 
		- monitor urinary albumin and increase dose 
		- no benefit of combination or use prior to albuminuria 
		- if need additional agent 
			- diuretic 
			- CCBs (nondihydropyridine class)
			- beta blocker (avoid if risk of hypoglycemia ) 
			- Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists but monitor serum K 
		- SGLT2  reduce decline in GFR and albuminuria 
			- risk of euglycemic DKA 
			- avoid in T1 or insuline deficient T2 
	- protein 0.8g/kg/day 
- nephrology consultation at 
	- GFR <30ml 
	- Atypical feature 
		- hematuria 
		- rapidly declining renal function 
		- albuminuria >3g/day 
- refer for transplant at 20ml GFR 
- preemptive kidney transplant (living donor) or simultaneously pancreatic-kidney transplant from deceased more useful than waiting for renal alone 
- dialysis has more complications in DM like hypotension , difficult IV access and accelerated progression of retinopathy 
# Neuropathy 
- 50% 
- diffuse neuropathy (DSPN, autonomic)
- mononeuropathy 
- radiculopathy/polyradiculopathy 
- correlation with duration and control of DM 
- other 
	- BMI 
	- Smoking 
	- CVD 
	- TGs 
	- Hypertension 
- both myelinated and unmyelinated 
- diagnosis of exclusion 
## Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy 
- most common 
- distal sensory loss and pain 
- asymptomatic in 50% 
- symptoms 
	- numbness 
	- tingling 
	- sharpness 
	- burning 
	- begins in feet and spreads proximal 
- Acute (<12m or chronic )
- Acute usually due to improved glycemic control and settles over time but some motor or sensory deficits may remain 
- examination 
	- sensory loss to 10g monofilament or vibration 
	- loss of ankle DTRs 
	- abnormal position sense 
	- muscle atrophy 
	- foot drop 
- Annual screening (5years after T1 diagnosis and at T2 diagnosis ) which is aimed at detecting LOPS (loss of protective sensation )
## Autonomic 
- parasympathetic (cholinergic) and sympathetic (adrenergic) systems 
- cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (GI), genitourinary, sudomotor, and metabolic systems 
- CVS 
	- decreased heart rate variability, 
	- resting tachycardia, and
	- orthostatic hypotension, -- late and unusual , but also in DPN and parasympathetic dysfunction 
	- is associated with an increase in CVD
	- sudden death due to disposition to hypoglycemia which may prolong QTc interval 
- Gastroparesis and bladder-emptying abnormalities 
- sympathetic dysfunction causes Hyperhidrosis of the upper extremities and anhidrosis of the lower extremities (promotes cracking and ulcers)
## Mononeuropathy and/or Radiculopathy/Polyradiculopathy 
- pain and motor weakness in distribution in single nerve 
- carpal tunnel (entrapment) or noncompressive 
- 3rd CN most common starts with diplopia -- ptosis and ophthalmoplegia with normal pupils to light 
- 4,6,7 nerves maybe involved sometimes 
- Peripheral mononeuropathies or simultaneous involvement of more than one nerve (mononeuropathy multiplex) may also occur. 
- radiculopathy or polyradiculopathy characterized by severe disabling pain in the distribution of one or more nerve roots +/- motor weakness 
	- self-limited and resolved in 6-12 months 
##  Treatment 
- glycemic control 
- Lifestyle modifications (exercise, diet) in DSPN in type 2 DM and 
- hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia treated 
- avoid neurotoxins (including alcohol) and smoking,
- supplementation with vitamins for possible deficiencies (B12, folate 
- check their feet daily and take precautions (footwear) aimed at preventing calluses or ulcerations 
- duloxetine and pregabalin, or gabapentin is usually initially used for pain approved by FDA 
- may respond to tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine, carbamazepine, tramadol, or topical capsaicin products. 
- 8% capsaicin patch requires application by a health care pro- vider. Tapentadol, a centrally acting opioid, is also approved

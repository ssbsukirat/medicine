- Microvascular complications are diabetes- specific, whereas macrovascular complications have additional pathophysiologic features that are shared with the general population 
# Glycemic control & complications 
- microvascular complications of both type 1 and type 2 DM result from chronic hyperglycemia 
- The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)--  definitive proof that reduction in chronic hyperglycemia can prevent many complications of type 1 DM
- continuous relationship between hba1c and development of complications
- Strict HTN control benefits both micro and macro vascular complications 
- BP control more beneficial than hba1c control on UKPDS study 
- American Heart association recommended
	- 130/80 target in high CVS risk 
	- 140/90 in low risk 
- Metabolic memory
	- Early intense control is beneficial long-term even if later control is poor 
# Mechanism
- Unknown
- Chronic Hyperglycemia 
	- may lead to epigenetic changes even though it's multifactorial
	- Advanced Glycolated end products (AGEs) like pentosidine, glucosepane, carboxymethyl lysine 
	- Non-enzymatic glycosylation of intra and extracellular protein
- growth factors
	- Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) locally in diabetic retinopathy which reduces after photocoagulation and is targeted by intravitreal injections 
- Reactive oxygen species by Hyperglycemia
- Macrovascular complications
	- Both Hyperglycemia and risk factors like

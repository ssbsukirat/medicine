# epidemiology 
- Conns is aldosterone producing adrenal adenoma 
- 5-12% of all hypertension is mineralocorticoid excess 
- higher in hypokalemic hypertension 
# Etiology 
- PRIMARY is most common (increase production of aldosterone by zona glomerulosa )
- Bilateral hyperplasia (micronodules > large nodules)  > Unilateral adenoma 
- ![[mineralocorticoidexcesscauses.png]]
- Consider Carcinom in young and if size >2cm 
## Glucocorticoid Remediable Aldosteronism 
- rare cause 
- crossover of CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 genes yielding chimeric gene 
- causes CYP11B2 (mineralocorticoid gene) under ACTH control (rather than renin) 
- family history of hypertension ++ 
- early onset hypertension and stroke 
- glucocorticoid suppression can reduce mineralocorticoid production 
## Syndrome of Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess 
- SAME 
- activation of MR by a steroid other than aldosterone 
	- Cortisol if it escapes deactivation by 11B-HSD2 (inactivating mutations)
- ***severe hypokalemic hypertension in childhood***
- type 2 SAME -- milder mutation causing normokalemic hypertension in adults 
- Inhibition of 11B-HSD2 by licorice also causes 
- excess cortisol in cushings may cause 
- Progesterone may cause hypokalemic hypertension rarely in MR mutation which activates by progesterone 
- DOC (deoxycorticosterone) 
	- DOC also binds and activates the MR and can cause hypertension if its circulating concentrations are increased. 
	- autonomous DOC secretion by an ACC, 
	- also when DOC accumulates as a consequence of an adrenal enzymatic block, as seen in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to CYP11B1 (11β-hydroxylase) or CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase) deficiency
## Liddle 
- excess mineralocorticoid activity can be caused by mutations in the β or γ subunits of the ENaC, disrupting its interaction with Nedd4
- decreasing receptor internalization and degradation 
- drives hypokalemic hypertension 
- Autosomal Dominant 
# Clinical 
- potassium depletion + sodium retention

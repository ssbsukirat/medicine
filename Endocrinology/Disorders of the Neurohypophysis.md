# Disorders of the Neurohypophysis

- The neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary) is composed of **large neuronal axons** originating in cell bodies in the **supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus**.
- These axons project through the diaphragm sella and terminate as bulbous enlargements on a capillary plexus.
- Some neurons produce **arginine vasopressin (AVP)**, also known as antidiuretic hormone; others produce **oxytocin**.
- **AVP** acts on renal tubules to **reduce water loss by concentrating urine**.
- **Oxytocin** stimulates **postpartum milk letdown** in response to suckling.
- A **deficiency of AVP secretion or action** causes a syndrome with **large amounts of dilute urine**.
- **Excessive or inappropriate AVP production** impairs urinary water excretion and predisposes to **hyponatremia** if water intake is not reduced.

# VASOPRESSIN

## SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION

- AVP is a **nonapeptide**.
- Synthesized via a **polypeptide precursor** that includes AVP, neurophysin, and copeptin, all encoded by a **single gene on chromosome 20**.
- The precursor is packaged in neurosecretory vesicles, transported down the axon, processed, stored, and released by **exocytosis**.
- AVP secretion is primarily regulated by **"effective" osmotic pressure**, determined largely by plasma sodium and its anions.
- This regulation is mediated by **osmoreceptors** in the **anteromedial hypothalamus**, which are extremely sensitive to small changes in plasma sodium and anions but insensitive to urea and glucose.
- The osmoregulatory system acts as a **threshold, or set point, control system**.
    - **Below threshold**: plasma AVP is suppressed, permitting maximum water diuresis.
    - **Above threshold**: plasma AVP rises steeply, quickly reaching levels for maximum antidiuresis.
    - Average threshold for AVP release: **∼275 mosmol/L plasma osmolarity** and **135 meq/L plasma sodium**.
- The osmostat set point decreases **∼1% during the luteal phase** and **∼3% during pregnancy**.
- It is also reduced by **decreased blood pressure or >10–20% volume loss**, mediated by neuronal afferents from transmural pressure receptors.
- AVP secretion can be stimulated by **nausea (extremely potent, 50- to 100-fold increases)**, acute hypoglycemia, glucocorticoid deficiency, smoking, and possibly hyperangiotensinemia.
- Emetic stimuli act via the **emetic center in the medulla** and can be blocked by antiemetics.
- Pain or other noxious stresses do not affect AVP unless they elicit a vasovagal reaction with nausea and hypotension.

## ACTION

- The most important physiologic action of AVP is to **reduce water excretion by promoting urine concentration (antidiuretic effect)**.
- This effect is achieved by **increasing the hydroosmotic permeability of principal cells** in the distal tubule and medullary collecting ducts of the kidney.
- AVP binds to **V2 receptors** on the basal surface of principal cells, causing **aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels** to be inserted into the apical surface.
    - These channels allow water to flow passively from the lumen through the cell down the osmotic gradient in the renal medulla.
    - V2 receptors are encoded by a gene on chromosome Xq28, and AQP2 by a gene on chromosome 12q13.
- In the absence of AVP, these cells are impermeable to water, leading to a high urine output (up to 0.2 mL/kg/min) and low osmolarity (∼50 mosmol/L).
- Maximum antidiuresis in healthy humans occurs at **plasma AVP levels of 1 to 3 pg/mL**, resulting in urine osmolarity as high as **1200 mosmol/L** and output as low as 0.35 mL/min.
- Maximum concentrating capacity varies based on renal medulla hypertonicity, influenced by AVPR2-stimulated urea reabsorption.
- High basal fluid intake can temporarily diminish renal concentrating capacity.
- At **high concentrations**, AVP also causes:
    - **Contraction of smooth muscle** in blood vessels of the skin and gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Glycogenolysis in the liver**.
    - **Potentiation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release** by corticotropin-releasing factor.
- These non-antidiuretic effects are mediated by **V1a or V1b receptors** coupled to phospholipase C.
- Their role in human physiology/pathophysiology **remains to be determined**.

## METABOLISM

- AVP distributes rapidly into a space roughly equal to the extracellular fluid volume.
- It is cleared irreversibly with a **half-life (t1/2) of 10–30 min**.
- Most AVP clearance is due to **degradation in the liver and kidneys**.
- During pregnancy, the metabolic clearance of AVP increases **three- to fourfold** due to placental production of an N-terminal peptidase.

# THIRST

- A mechanism for ensuring adequate water intake is essential for preventing dehydration, as AVP cannot reduce water loss below a minimum. This function is performed by the **thirst mechanism**.
- Like AVP, thirst and fluid intake are regulated primarily by an **osmostat in the anteromedial hypothalamus**.
- The thirst osmostat is "set" **about 3% higher than the AVP osmostat**. This ensures thirst and polydipsia occur only when plasma osmolarity/sodium exceeds the antidiuretic mechanism's capacity.
- Defects in this mechanism result in hypodipsia, AVP secretion abnormalities, and water balance disorders.
- The gastrointestinal tract has a mechanism that detects fluid intake and **transiently inhibits thirst and AVP secretion** before plasma osmolarity/sodium is reduced. Its role in clinical disorders is not determined.

# OXYTOCIN

- Oxytocin is a nonapeptide, differing from AVP only at positions 3 and 8.
- It has **relatively little antidiuretic effect**.
- It mainly acts on **mammary ducts to facilitate milk letdown during nursing**.
- It may help initiate or facilitate labor by stimulating uterine smooth muscle contraction, but its physiological necessity for normal delivery is unclear.

# DEFICIENCIES OF AVP SECRETION AND ACTION

## DIABETES INSIPIDUS (DI)

### Clinical Characteristics

- DI is a syndrome characterized by the excretion of **abnormally large volumes of dilute urine**.
- Diagnostic criteria: **24-h urine volume > 40 mL/kg body weight** and **24-h urine osmolarity < 280 mosm/L**.
- Polyuria causes symptoms like **urinary frequency, enuresis, and/or nocturia**.
- It also causes a slight rise in plasma osmolarity/sodium, which stimulates **thirst and a compensatory increase in fluid intake (polydipsia)**.
- Clinical symptoms and signs of dehydration are **uncommon** unless thirst and/or water intake are also impaired.

### Etiology

- harrison table 
- DI is divided into **four types based on etiology**:
    1. **Primary deficiency of AVP secretion (Neurohypophyseal, Neurogenic, Pituitary, Cranial, or Central DI)**.
        - Can be caused by congenital, acquired, or genetic disorders, but is **often idiopathic**.
        - **Genetic forms**:
            - Most common: **autosomal dominant**, caused by mutations in one allele of the **AVP–neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene**. These mutations alter amino acids critical for prohormone processing/folding, interfering with trafficking and eventually destroying magnocellular neurons. AVP deficiency develops gradually and is usually permanent.
            - Rare **autosomal recessive forms**: due to inactivating AVP gene mutations (biologically inactive AVP), large AVP gene deletions, or **WFS1 gene mutations (Wolfram’s syndrome - DIDMOAD)**.
            - An **X-linked recessive form** (Xq28) has been reported.
            - Mutations in the **PCSK1 gene** are associated with severe early malabsorptive diarrhea and polyuria-polydipsia.
    2. **Suppression of AVP secretion by excessive fluid intake (Primary Polydipsia)**.
        - Subdivided into:
            - **Dipsogenic DI**: caused by **inappropriate thirst**, can follow head trauma or multifocal brain diseases (e.g., neurosarcoid), often idiopathic.
            - **Psychogenic polydipsia**: not associated with thirst, a feature of psychosis or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
            - **Iatrogenic polydipsia**: increased water intake due to belief in health benefits.
    3. **Increased AVP degradation by placental N-terminal aminopeptidase (Gestational DI)**.
        - Manifests during pregnancy and usually remits several weeks after delivery.
    4. **Renal insensitivity to AVP (Nephrogenic DI)**.
        - Can be caused by drugs (e.g., **lithium**), disorders (e.g., **hypokalemia**), or genetic mutations.
        - **Genetic forms**:
            - Most common: **semirecessive X-linked**, due to mutations in the **V2 receptor gene on chromosome Xq28**.
            - Autosomal recessive or dominant forms: caused by mutations of the **aquaporin-2 water channels gene on chromosome 20**.

### Pathophysiology

- In **pituitary and nephrogenic DI**:
    - Defect in urine concentration leads to a **rise in water excretion**, a small (1–2%) decrease in body water, and a **commensurate increase in plasma osmolarity/sodium**.
    - This stimulates thirst and a compensatory increase in water intake.
    - The antidiuretic defect varies; even with partial defects, maximum urine osmolarity is usually less than normal because prior AVP deficiency temporarily diminishes renal concentrating capacity.
    - The underlying cause can be determined by analyzing the relationship of urine osmolarity to plasma AVP and plasma AVP to plasma osmolarity/sodium (Figure 381-3).
- The pathophysiology of **primary polydipsia** is the reverse:
    - Increased fluid intake **reduces plasma osmolarity/sodium and AVP secretion**.
    - The resultant urinary dilution produces a compensatory increase in urinary free-water excretion, which usually stabilizes plasma osmolarity/sodium at a level below basal.
    - **Hyponatremia is uncommon** unless polydipsia is severe or the compensatory water diuresis is impaired.
    - Fluid deprivation or hypertonic saline infusion produces a **normal rise in plasma AVP**.
    - However, the resultant increase in urine concentration is usually subnormal because the kidney's concentrating capacity is temporarily diminished by the prior lack of AVP stimulation.
    - Unlike other DI types, the relationships of the rise in plasma AVP to the rise in plasma and urine osmolarity are **both normal** in primary polydipsia (Figure 381-3).

### Differential Diagnosis

- If symptoms of urinary frequency, enuresis, nocturia, and/or persistent thirst are present **without glucosuria**, DI should be evaluated.
- A **24-h urine collection on unrestricted fluid intake** is performed: if osmolarity is <280 mosm/L and volume >50 mL/kg/day, DI is confirmed.
- **Traditional approach (if basal plasma osmolarity/sodium are normal)**:
    - **Fluid deprivation for 4–6 h**, closely monitoring body weight, plasma osmolarity/sodium, and urine osmolarity.
    - If plasma osmolarity and sodium rise above normal **without concentrating the urine**, primary polydipsia is excluded, and AVP or desmopressin injection determines if it's severe pituitary or severe nephrogenic DI.
    - If urine concentrates, AVP or desmopressin injection **does not reliably distinguish** between partial pituitary DI, partial nephrogenic DI, and primary polydipsia due to temporary diminution of renal concentrating capacity.
- **Ambiguities can be avoided by measuring plasma AVP before and during 4–6 h of fluid deprivation**, relating values to concurrent plasma and urine osmolarity (Figure 381-3).
    - This reliably distinguishes between pituitary and nephrogenic DI (even partial).
    - It differentiates partial pituitary DI from primary polydipsia if plasma osmolarity and sodium rise above the normal range; often requires a **short infusion of 3% saline** to achieve this level of dehydration.
- A **simpler, less stressful method** is to measure **basal plasma AVP and urine osmolarity on unrestricted fluid intake** (Figure 381-4).
    - If **AVP is normal or elevated (>1 pg/mL) and urine osmolarity is low (<280 mosm/L)**, the patient likely has **nephrogenic DI**.
    - If **basal plasma AVP is low or undetectable (<1 pg/mL)**, nephrogenic DI is unlikely, and a **brain MRI** can differentiate pituitary DI from primary polydipsia.
        - The **hyperintense signal (bright spot) of the posterior pituitary on T1-weighted images** is a function of AVP stores.
        - It is almost always **present in primary polydipsia** but is **abnormally small or absent in pituitary DI**.
        - The bright spot is also faint or absent in nephrogenic DI (due to chronic AVP secretion stimulus depleting stores).
        - Therefore, MRI **does not differentiate between pituitary and nephrogenic DI** unless other pathology is found.
        - The bright spot is also absent in empty sella and sometimes present in infants with familial pituitary DI in early stages.
- If MRI and AVP assays are unavailable/impractical, a **properly dosed and monitored trial of desmopressin therapy** can be used.
    - In **nephrogenic DI**: **no effect** on urine output, fluid intake, or plasma osmolarity/sodium.
    - In **pituitary DI**: **abolishes polyuria and polydipsia**, reducing plasma osmolarity/sodium by 1–2%.
    - In **primary polydipsia**: **eliminates polyuria but not polydipsia**, invariably producing **moderate to severe hyponatremia within 8–24 h**.
- The measurement of **plasma copeptin** has been advocated but its relationship to plasma and urine osmolarity is not diagnostic, and diagnoses obtained by this method **do not correlate well with MRI findings or response to antidiuretic therapy**.

# TREATMENT

## Diabetes Insipidus

- **Pituitary DI**:
    - Treated with **desmopressin (DDAVP)**, a synthetic AVP analogue.
    - DDAVP acts selectively at **V2 receptors** to increase urine concentration and decrease flow in a dose-dependent manner.
    - It is more resistant to degradation and has a **three- to fourfold longer duration of action** than AVP.
    - Administration: IV, SC injection, nasal inhalation, or oral tablet/melt.
    - Treatment rapidly reduces fluid intake and urine output to normal, with only a slight increase in body water and a **1–2% decrease in plasma osmolarity/sodium**, eliminating thirst and polydipsia (Figure 381-5).
    - **Hyponatremia rarely develops** unless urine volume is reduced below 10 mL/kg/day or fluid intake is excessive due to an associated thirst or cognition abnormality. Patients should be taught to drink only when truly thirsty.
- **Primary Polydipsia**:
    - **Cannot be treated safely with DDAVP** or other antidiuretic drugs.
    - Eliminating polyuria does not eliminate the urge to drink, invariably leading to **hyponatremia and/or water intoxication**.
    - There is no consistently effective way to correct dipsogenic or psychogenic polydipsia; the iatrogenic form may respond to patient education.
    - Patients should be warned about other drugs (e.g., thiazide diuretics, carbamazepine) that can impair urinary free-water excretion.
- **Nephrogenic DI**:
    - Polyuria and polydipsia are **not affected by standard doses of DDAVP**.
    - Treatment with **conventional doses of a thiazide diuretic and/or amiloride**, in conjunction with a **low-sodium diet** and a **prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (e.g., indomethacin)**, usually reduces polyuria and polydipsia by 30–70%.
    - Side effects can be minimized with amiloride or potassium supplements.

# HYPODIPSIC HYPERNATREMIA

- An increase in plasma osmolarity/sodium above the normal range (hypertonic hypernatremia) can be due to a **decrease in total body water or an increase in total body sodium**.
- This chapter focuses on hypodipsic hypernatremia, which is due to a **primary defect in the thirst mechanism**.

## Clinical Characteristics

- A syndrome of **chronic or recurrent hypertonic dehydration**.
- Hypernatremia varies in severity and is often associated with signs of **hypovolemia** (e.g., tachycardia, postural hypotension, azotemia, hyperuricemia, hypokalemia due to secondary hyperaldosteronism).
- Other symptoms: muscle weakness, pain, rhabdomyolysis, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and acute renal failure. Obtundation or coma may be present.
- Plasma AVP is usually subnormal relative to the hypernatremia, but still adequate to prevent DI.
- DI may develop during rehydration as blood volume, blood pressure, and plasma osmolarity/sodium return toward normal.

## Etiology

- Usually due to **hypogenesis or destruction of osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus** that regulate thirst.
- Causes include:
    - **Congenital malformations of midline brain structures**.
    - **Acquired diseases**: surgery or aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery, primary or metastatic hypothalamic tumors, head trauma, granulomatous diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis), AIDS, and cytomegalovirus encephalitis.
    - **Adipsic hypernatremia without demonstrable hypothalamic lesions** has been associated with autoantibodies against the subfornical organ.
    - Transient episodes linked to depression or other psychological disorders suggest reversible neurochemical defects.

## Pathophysiology

- A **deficiency in osmotically induced thirst** leads to a failure to drink enough water to replenish obligatory losses, causing plasma osmolarity and sodium to rise.
- In most cases, plasma AVP is subnormal but still adequate to prevent DI.
- During rehydration, plasma AVP sometimes falls to levels that result in DI before full correction (Figure 381-6).
- In other cases, plasma AVP does not decline even with overhydration, leading to a hyponatremic syndrome resembling inappropriate antidiuresis, suggesting AVP osmoreceptors provide both inhibitory and stimulatory input.
- AVP secretion responds normally to nonosmotic stimuli, indicating an intact neurohypophysis.
- Rarely, the neurohypophysis is also destroyed, resulting in a **combination of chronic pituitary DI and hypodipsia**, which is life-threatening and difficult to manage.
- Very rarely, AVP regulation is completely normal, suggesting a defect in post-osmoreceptor neural pathways.
- Figure 381-6 illustrates the **heterogeneity of osmoregulatory dysfunction**, showing how plasma AVP can respond differently to changes in plasma osmolarity in various conditions, including partial or total deficiencies in osmoregulation of thirst and AVP.

## Differential Diagnosis

- Usually distinguished from other causes of inadequate fluid intake by **clinical history and setting**.
- **Previous episodes, denial of thirst, and failure to drink spontaneously** when conscious and hypernatremic are virtually diagnostic.
- Hypernatremia from excessive sodium retention/intake is distinguished by the **presence of thirst and signs of hypervolemia** instead of hypovolemia.

## TREATMENT

- Hypodipsic hypernatremia is corrected by **administering water orally** (if alert) or by **infusing hypotonic fluids**(e.g., 0.45% saline or 5% dextrose and water).
- The amount of free water required can be estimated by the formula: **ΔFW = 0.5BW × ([SNa – 140]/140)**. If serum glucose is elevated, corrected SNa* = SNa + ([SGlu – 90]/36).
- This amount, plus an allowance for ongoing losses, should be given over **24–48 h**.
- **Close monitoring of serum sodium, fluid intake, and urinary output is essential**.
- Some patients may develop AVP-deficient DI (requiring DDAVP), while others may develop hyponatremia and a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD)-like picture if overhydrated.
- Insulin and/or potassium supplements may be needed if hyperglycemia/hypokalemia are present.
- Plasma urea/creatinine should be monitored for signs of acute renal failure.
- After rehydration, a **brain MRI and tests of anterior pituitary function** should be performed to identify the cause and collateral defects.
- A **long-term management plan** should include a practical method to regulate fluid intake, preferably based on **body weight or serum sodium home monitoring**, rather than a fixed fluid intake which is often problematic.

# INAPPROPRIATE ANTIDIURESIS (SIAD)

## Clinical Characteristics

- SIAD is characterized by **hypo-osmolemic hyponatremia** and **impaired urinary dilution**.
- It occurs in the **absence of hypovolemia, hypotension, or other nonosmotic stimuli to AVP secretion**.
- Gradual/long-standing hyponatremia may be asymptomatic.
- Severe/acute hyponatremia can cause symptoms ranging from headache, confusion, and anorexia to nausea, vomiting, coma, and convulsions.
- SIAD occurs in many diverse clinical settings (Table 381-2).
- ![[Endocrinology/SIADHcauses.png]]

## Etiology

- The cause of SIAD is a **failure to maximally dilute the urine and mount a water diuresis** when total water intake exceeds urinary and insensible water loss.
- Most cases are due to an **abnormality in AVP secretion (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone - SIADH)**.
    - The defect can take several forms (Figure 381-6).
    - Most common: AVP secretion responds normally, but the **set point/threshold of the system is lower than normal**.
    - Others: AVP secretion appears **fixed or totally erratic**.
- In ∼10% of cases, there is **no demonstrable defect in AVP osmoregulation**, and impaired urinary dilution is due to a **kidney abnormality (Nephrogenic SIAD - NSIAD)**.
    - Some NSIAD cases are traced to a **constitutive activating mutation of the V2 receptor gene or the stimulatory G alpha protein GNAS** (familial NSIAD).

## Pathophysiology

- Failure to mount a water diuresis leads to a **slight expansion of total body water**.
- This is followed by a **modest increase in urinary sodium excretion** (due to suppressed plasma renin activity and aldosterone).
- Extracellular volume expansion is minimal, and **clinically detectable edema does not develop**.
- Intracellular volume increases, especially in the brain, causing increased pressure and symptoms.
- After several days, symptoms may subside due to inactivation of intracellular solutes.

## Differential Diagnosis

- SIADH and NSIAD must be differentiated from other types of hypo-osmolemic hyponatremia with impaired urinary dilution, typically by history, physical examination, and basic laboratory findings (Table 381-3).
- **Hypervolemic hyponatremia (type I)**: generalized edema (e.g., CHF, cirrhosis), elevated plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone.
- **Hypovolemic hyponatremia (type II)**: sodium/water loss (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, adrenal insufficiency), often with hypotension and elevated PRA.
- **Euvolemic hyponatremia (type III)**:
    - Caused by severe deficiency in **cortisol or thyroxine** (managed accordingly).
    - **SIADH and NSIAD**: absence of edema or history/signs of sodium/water loss, urinary sodium may be slightly elevated, PRA often low.
    - **Plasma AVP measurement is usually of little diagnostic value** except to differentiate SIADH from NSIAD in children/families with multiple affected members. If AVP is undetectable, AVPR2 gene sequencing is indicated.

# TREATMENT

## Inappropriate Antidiuresis

- Management differs based on type, severity, and duration of symptoms.
- **Hypervolemic hyponatremia**:
    - Objective: **reduce total body sodium and water**.
    - Mild/asymptomatic: **restrict daily fluid intake**.
    - Severe/symptomatic: **AVP antagonist (e.g., tolvaptan or conivaptan)** to increase urinary water excretion. Use limited to 30 days due to liver risks.
    - **Hypertonic saline infusion is absolutely contraindicated** (worsens edema, precipitates cardiovascular decompensation).
- **Hypovolemic hyponatremia**:
    - **Fluid restriction and AVP inhibitors are absolutely contraindicated** (aggravate hypovolemia).
    - Stop sodium/water loss and **replace deficits orally or with isotonic/hypertonic saline infusion**.
    - **Caution**: plasma sodium should not increase too rapidly or too far to prevent **osmotic demyelination** in the brain.
- **Euvolemic hyponatremia**:
    - If due to cortisol/thyroxine deficiency, **gradual replacement** suffices.
    - **In SIADH**:
        - Mild/asymptomatic: **restrict total water intake** (~30 mL/kg/day less than urine output).
        - Severe/symptomatic: **partially correct with intravenous hypertonic (3%) saline infusion or AVP antagonist (tolvaptan or conivaptan)** [43, Fig. 381-7].
            - 3% saline raises serum sodium by ~1–2 meq/L per hour.
            - Vaptans increase urine output. Tolvaptan: 15 mg PO qd, up to 60 mg. Conivaptan: 20 mg loading dose, then 20 mg IV over 24 h.
            - Fluid intake should be monitored and restricted to under-replace urine output.
            - **Monitor plasma osmolarity/sodium every 1–2 h**; adjust treatment to keep rise at **∼1% an hour until values reach ∼270 mosm/L or 130 meq/L**, then discontinue.
            - **Raising plasma sodium faster or farther increases the risk of central pontine myelinolysis**.
- In **SIAD due to an activating mutation of the V2 receptor**, V2 antagonists may not be effective. An **osmotic diuretic such as urea** is reported effective for long-term prevention/correction of hyponatremia.

# GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES

- Fluid and electrolyte disorders differ in tropical/nonindustrialized countries.
- **Hyponatremia is more common** and often due to **infectious diseases** (e.g., cholera, shigellosis, diarrheal disorders), likely from gastrointestinal salt and water losses (hypovolemia type II).
- Causes of DI are similar worldwide, except that **malaria and venoms from snake or insect bites are much more common** in some tropical climates.

* Systemic disease abdominal pain 
* by S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi serotypes A, B, and C
* initially called ***typhoid*** fever because of  similarity to typhus. In the early 1800s, typhoid fever was defined pathologically as a unique illness association with enlarged Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. In 1869, the term enteric fever was proposed as an alternative.
# Epidemiology
## Spread 
* food-borne or waterborne transmission  from fecal contamination by ill or asymptomatic chronic carriers. 
* Sexual transmission between male partners 
* Health care workers  acquire enteric fever after exposure to infected patients or during processing of clinical specimens and cultures.
## Seen more in 
* mixing of drinking water with human sewage.
* In endemic regions, more common in poor neighborhoods in large cities than rural areas 
* young children and adolescents than among other age groups.
##  Risk factors
* fecally contaminated drinking water or ice, 
* flooding,
* food and drinks purchased from street vendors, 
* raw fruits and vegetables grown in fields fertilized with sewage, 
* ill household contacts, 
* lack of hand washing and toilet access 
* prior Helicobacter pylori infection 
1:4 paratyphi to typhi but increasing in india 
## Drug Resistance
* strains contain ***plasmids*** encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim 
* MDR strains with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (DSC; minimal inhibitory concentration ≥0.125 μg/mL) or ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC, ≥1 μg/mL) emerged on the Indian subcontinent 
* clone ***H58***, which increasingly has been associated with clinical treatment failure of fluoroquinolones

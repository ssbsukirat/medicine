* Systemic disease abdominal pain 
* by S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi serotypes A, B, and C
* initially called ***typhoid*** fever because of  similarity to typhus. In the early 1800s, typhoid fever was defined pathologically as a unique illness association with enlarged Peyer’s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. In 1869, the term enteric fever was proposed as an alternative.
# Epidemiology
## Spread 
* food-borne or waterborne transmission  from fecal contamination by ill or asymptomatic chronic carriers. 
* Sexual transmission between male partners 
* Health care workers  acquire enteric fever after exposure to infected patients or during processing of clinical specimens and cultures.
## Seen more in 
* mixing of drinking water with human sewage.
* In endemic regions, more common in poor neighborhoods in large cities than rural areas 
* young children and adolescents than among other age groups.
##  Risk factors
* fecally contaminated drinking water or ice, 
* flooding,
* food and drinks purchased from street vendors, 
* raw fruits and vegetables grown in fields fertilized with sewage, 
* ill household contacts, 
* lack of hand washing and toilet access 
* prior Helicobacter pylori infection 
1:4 paratyphi to typhi but increasing in india 
## Drug Resistance
* strains contain ***plasmids*** encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim 
* MDR strains with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (DSC; minimal inhibitory concentration ≥0.125 μg/mL) or ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC, ≥1 μg/mL) emerged on the Indian subcontinent 
* clone ***H58***, which increasingly has been associated with clinical treatment failure of fluoroquinolones
* Testing of isolates for resistance to the first-generation quinolone nalidixic acid no longer recommended 

# Clinical course
* Misnomer as fever and abdominal pain are variable
* IP mean 10-14 days but overall 5-21 days
* most prominent symptom is prolonged fever (38.8°–40.5°C /101.8°–104.9°F), continue for up to 4 weeks if untreated
* typhi vs paratyphi  clinically indistinguishable
* Symptoms
	* headache (80%)
	* chills (35–45%)
	* cough (30%)
	* sweating (20–25%)
	* myalgias (20%)
	* malaise (10%)
	* arthralgia (2–4%)
* GI symptoms 
	* anorexia (55%)
	* abdominal pain (30–40%)
	* nausea (18–24%)
	* vomiting(18%)
	* diarrhea (22–28%)
	* constipation (13–16%).
* Physical findings
	* coated tongue (51–56%)
	* splenomegaly (5–6%)
	* abdominal tenderness (4–5%).
	* rash (“rose spots”; 30%)
		* faint, salmon-colored, blanching, maculopapular rash located primarily on the trunk and chest.
		* at the end of the first week and resolves without a trace after 2–5 days.
		* two or three crops of lesions,
		* Salmonella can be cultured from punch biopsies of these lesions.
		* The faintness of the rash makes it difficult to detect in highly pigmented patients.
	* hepatosplenomegaly (3–6%), 
	* epistaxis 
	* relative bradycardia at the peak of high fever (<50%).
* Complications (27% of hospitalised)
	* GI bleed (6%) and perforation (1%) in 3rd and 4th weeks 
	* due to hyperplasia, ulceration and necrosis of ileocecal peyer patches 
	* life-threatening and require immediate fluid resuscitation and surgical intervention, with broadened antibiotic coverage for polymicrobial peritonitis
* Neuro manifestations
	* 2-40% patients 
	* include
		* meningitis 
		* GBS
		* ***Neuropsychiatric symptoms (muttering delirium or coma vigil) with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects***
* Uncommon complications 
	* DIC 
	* hematophagocytic syndrome 
	* pancreatitis 
	* HEPATIC /splenic abcess/ granuloma 
	* Endo-/ Peri-/ Myocarditis 
	* orchitis
	* hepatitis
	* Glomerulonephritis
	* pyelonephritis
	* HUS 
	* Pneumonia severe 
	* arthritis
	* osteomyelitis
	* endophthalmitis
	* parotitis
* Up to 10% of patients develop mild relapse, usually within 2–3 weeks of fever resolution
* Chronic carriage 
	* Up to 10% of untreated patients with typhoid fever excrete S. Typhi in the ***feces for up to 3 months***, and 2–5% develop ***chronic asymptomatic carriage, shedding S. Typhi in either urine or stool for >1 year***.
	* Chronic carriage more common
		* women,
		* infants
		* persons who have biliary abnormalities or concurrent bladder infection with Schistosoma haematobium 
	* adapted to survive in the gallbladder environment by forming ***biofilms*** on gallstones and invading gallbladder epithelial cells.
	* associated with an increased risk of gallbladder cancer

* Obstructive (more common) and central are both sleep related breathing disorder
* Impaired ventilation during sleep 
* Obstructive 
    * More common
    * Daytime sleep and impaired function
    * Hypertension
    * Cardiovascular disease
    * Behavioral problems in children
* Central
    * Less common
    * Alone or with OSA
    * Primary or secondary
        * High altitude
        * Heart failure
        * Medication like opioid
    * Increase risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation
# obstructive sleep apnea
## definition
* On the basis of nocturnal daytime symptoms and sleep study
* Diagnosis
    * Symptoms of nocturnal breathing disturbance or daytime sleepiness or fatigue despite adequate opportunity to sleep and unexplained by medical problems ***and*** 
    * 5 or more episodes of apnea or hypapnea per hour (Apnea-hypopnea index or AHI which is apnea or hypopnea total divided by hours of sleep)
    * In absence of symptoms if AHO >15 every hour
* Hypopnea or apnea 
    * Reduction in breathing for 10s and >_ 3% drop in saturation or brain cortex arousal
* Severity graded on 
    * AHI,
    * amount of desaturation, 
    * duration of Apnea-hypopnea 
    * degree of sleep fragmentation 
    * level of daytime sleepiness or impairment
## Pathophysiology
* Negative intraluminal pressure in inspiration creates suction force
* No fixed bone in pharynx so stability depends on pharyngeal dilator muscles (activated in waking but neuromuscular drive reduces in sleep)
* Causes intermittent collapse of airway causing apnea (complete) or hypopnea (partial collapse)
* Episode terminated when ventilatory reflex activated and causes arousal restoring neuromuscular drive
* Site 
    * Soft palate (most common)
    * Tongue base 
    * Lateral pharyngeal wall 
    * Epiglottis
* Most severe during REM sleep and supine position
* Factors 
    * Small pharyngeal lumen (require higher drive)
    * Enlargement of soft tissue (tongue palate uvula) due to fat deposition increase lymphoid tissue or genetics 
    * Craniofacial (mandibular retroposition or micrognathia)
    * Low lung volume in recumbent position
    * High nasal resistance (DNS or polyp)
    * Nasal resistance breaks seal between tongue and palate and tongue falls posteriorly occluding airway
* Pharyngeal muscle factors/ vntilatory control
    * Ventilatory sensitivity
    * Arousal threshold
    * Neuromuscular response to CO2
        * Buildup activates diaphragm and pharyngeal muscle
        * Pharyngeal activation stiffens airways to counteract collapse 
        * But collapse of pharynx can occur if system is overly sensitive to CO2 
        * Increase CO2 arouses CNS and leads to awakening
        * Low arousal threshold preempts pharyngeal compensation and prevents stabilization
        * Higher threshold prevents termination of apnea prolonging it's duration and desaturation
## risk factors and prevalence
* Major
    * Male sex (2x risk than women)
         * Android pattern of obesity
         * Greater pharyngeal length 
         * Women protected by influence of sex hormones on ventilatory drive 
         * Women have lower arousal threshold and lower neuromuscular collapsibility 
    * Obesity (40-60% cases)
        * Due to narrowing by upper airway fat
        * Reduced chest wall compliance and lower lung volume
        * 4x greater risk
    * Older age
    * Mandibular retrognathia and micrognathia
    * Positive family history of OSA (2x in first degree relative)
    * Sedentary lifestyle
    * Genetic syndrome (down's, treacher-collins,)
    * Adenotonsillar hypertrophy (children)
    * Menopause
    * Endocrine (acromegaly, hypothyroidism)
    * Underlying medical conditions
        * DM, HTN AFA
## approach
- consider if symptoms and one or more risk factors
- Screen in symptoms with high risk of comorbidities 
- Symptoms 
    - sleep history from bed partner
    - Snoring most common but absence cannot exclude
    - Gasping or snorting in sleep
    - Dyspnea unusual (OSA vs PND, nocturnal asthma and reflux)
    - Frequent awakening and sleep disruption
    - Excessive daytime sleepiness (most common daytime symptom)
    - Fatigue (more in women)
    - Dry mouth, nocturnal heartburn, diaphoresis, nocturia, morning headache, low concentration, irritability, mood disturbance
    - Insomnia may coexist
- Physical
    - Hypertension and central obesity
    - Oropharynx -- small orifice with crowding
        - large tongue 
        - Low lying soft palate with bulky uvula
        - Large tonsils 
        - High arched palate 
        - Micrognathia retrognathia
    - Nasal 
        - polyps 
        - DNS
        - Allergic rhinitis
        - Obstruction
    - Cardiac examination
        - cor pulmonale suggests comorbid condition
        - ***OSA doesn't cause right heart failure***
    - NeurologicaL
- Laboratory
    - objective measure of breathing in sleep 
    - Gold standard is overnight polysomnogram 
    - If negative rule out OSA
        - false negative if not enough REM sleep or less supine or night to night variability
    - Home tests only record Cardiac and respiratory
    - If high suspicion, negative home study must be followed by PSG
    - Breathing
        - changes in airflow, respiratory excursion
    - Oxygen by saturation
    - Body position
    - Cardiac rhythm
    - Some measure sleep continuity and sleep stages by EEG, chin EMG, EOG and actigraphy leg movement and snoring intensity

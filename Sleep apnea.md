* Obstructive (more common) and central are both sleep related breathing disorder
* Impaired ventilation during sleep 
* Obstructive 
    * More common
    * Daytime sleep and impaired function
    * Hypertension
    * Cardiovascular disease
    * Behavioral problems in children
* Central
    * Less common
    * Alone or with OSA
    * Primary or secondary
        * High altitude
        * Heart failure
        * Medication like opioid
    * Increase risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation
# obstructive sleep apnea
## definition
* On the basis of nocturnal daytime symptoms and sleep study
* Diagnosis
    * Symptoms of nocturnal breathing disturbance or daytime sleepiness or fatigue despite adequate opportunity to sleep and unexplained by medical problems ***and*** 
    * 5 or more episodes of apnea or hypapnea per hour (Apnea-hypopnea index or AHI which is apnea or hypopnea total divided by hours of sleep)
    * In absence of symptoms if AHO >15 every hour
* Hypopnea or apnea 
    * Reduction in breathing for 10s and >_ 3% drop in saturation or brain cortex arousal
* Severity graded on 
    * AHI,
    * amount of desaturation, 
    * duration of Apnea-hypopnea 
    * degree of sleep fragmentation 
    * level of daytime sleepiness or impairment
## Pathophysiology
* Negative intraluminal pressure in inspiration creates suction force
* No fixed bone in pharynx so stability depends on pharyngeal dilator muscles (activated in waking but neuromuscular drive reduces in sleep)
* Causes intermittent collapse of airway causing apnea (complete) or hypopnea (partial collapse)

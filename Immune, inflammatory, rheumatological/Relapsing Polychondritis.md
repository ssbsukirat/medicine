# Relapsing Polychondritis

## General Information

- Relapsing polychondritis is an uncommon disorder of unknown cause.
- Characterized by inflammation of cartilage predominantly affecting the ears, nose, and laryngotracheobronchial tree.
- Multisystem disease occurs commonly and can also involve noncartilaginous tissues and organs.
- Estimated annual incidence is 3.5 per million.
- Peak age of onset is between 40 and 50 years, but can be seen in all ages.
- Both sexes are equally affected.
- Approximately 30% of patients have another rheumatologic disorder, most frequently systemic vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
- Nonrheumatic disorders have also been associated.
- Associated disorders usually antedate relapsing polychondritis by months or years.
- Onset of relapsing polychondritis can sometimes accompany the presentation of associated disorders.

## Pathology and Pathophysiology

- Earliest abnormality in hyaline and elastic cartilage is focal or diffuse loss of basophilic staining.
    - Indicates depletion of proteoglycan from the cartilage matrix.
- Inflammatory infiltrates are found adjacent to involved cartilage.
    - Consist predominantly of mononuclear cells and occasional plasma cells.
    - In acute disease, polymorphonuclear white cells may be present.
- Destruction of cartilage begins at the outer edges and advances centrally.
    - Includes lacunar breakdown and loss of chondrocytes.
- Degenerating cartilage is replaced by granulation tissue, later by fibrosis and focal areas of calcification.
- Small loci of cartilage regeneration may be present.
- Extracellular granular material in degenerating cartilage matrix (seen by electron microscopy) may be enzymes, immunoglobulins, or proteoglycans.
- Available data suggest both humoral and cell-mediated immunity play an important role in pathogenesis.
    - Immunoglobulin and complement deposits are found at sites of inflammation.
    - Antibodies to type II collagen, matrilin-1, and immune complexes are detected in the sera of some patients.
- Immune response to type II collagen may be important in pathogenesis.
    - Supported experimentally by auricular chondritis in rats immunized with type II collagen.
    - These rats have antibodies to type II collagen and immune deposits at sites of ear inflammation.
- Humoral immune responses to type IX and type XI collagen, matrilin-1, and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein demonstrated in some patients.
- Matrilin-1 is a noncollagenous protein in the extracellular matrix in cartilage.
    - Present in high concentrations in the trachea, also in nasal septum, but not articular cartilage.
    - Rats immunized with matrilin-1 developed severe inspiratory stridor and swelling of the nasal septum, without joint or ear cartilage involvement.
    - Rats had severe inflammation with erosions of involved cartilage, characterized by increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
    - All rats had IgG antibodies to matrilin-1.
    - Serum anti-matrilin-1 antibodies found in ~13% of relapsing polychondritis patients; ~70% of these had respiratory symptoms.
- Cell-mediated immunity may cause tissue injury.
    - Lymphocyte transformation can be demonstrated when lymphocytes of patients are exposed to cartilage extracts.
    - T cells specific for type II collagen found in some patients.
    - CD4+ T cells observed at sites of cartilage inflammation.
- Genetic background may play a role.
    - Significantly higher frequency of HLA-DR4 found in patients than healthy individuals, but no predominant subtype allele(s) found.

## Clinical Manifestations

- Onset is frequently abrupt, with one or two sites of cartilaginous inflammation.
- Pattern of cartilaginous involvement and frequency of episodes vary widely.
- Noncartilaginous presentations may occur.
- Systemic inflammatory features (fever, fatigue, weight loss) commonly occur and may precede other signs.
- Relapsing polychondritis may go unrecognized for months/years in patients with intermittent joint pain/swelling, unexplained eye inflammation, hearing loss, valvular heart disease, or pulmonary symptoms.
- Recent studies suggest different subgroups of presentation that vary in time to diagnosis, clinical/radiologic features, and complications.
- Recognition of disease patterns beyond cartilaginous involvement may facilitate diagnosis.
- **Auricular chondritis** (ear inflammation) is the most frequent presenting manifestation.
    - Occurs in 40% of patients at presentation.
    - Eventually affects ~85% of patients.
    - One or both ears involved, sequentially or simultaneously.
    - Sudden onset of pain, tenderness, and swelling of the cartilaginous portion of the ear (pinna).
    - **Sparing of the earlobes** (do not contain cartilage).
    - Overlying skin has a **beefy red or violaceous color**.
    - Prolonged/recurrent episodes lead to cartilage destruction and a droopy ear.
    - Swelling may close off the eustachian tube or external auditory meatus, impairing hearing.
    - Inflammation of internal auditory artery or cochlear branch causes hearing loss, vertigo, ataxia, nausea, vomiting.
    - Vertigo is almost always accompanied by hearing loss.
- **Nasal involvement** occurs in ~61% of patients.
    - 21% have nasal involvement at presentation.
    - Symptoms: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, epistaxis.
    - Bridge of nose and surrounding tissue become red, swollen, tender.
    - May collapse, producing a **saddle nose deformity**.
    - Nasal deformity can develop insidiously without overt inflammation.
    - Saddle nose is more frequent in younger patients, especially women.
- **Joint involvement** is the presenting manifestation in ~one-third of patients.
    - May be present for several months before other features.
    - Eventually, >one-half of patients have arthralgias or arthritis.
    - Arthritis is usually asymmetric and oligo- or polyarticular.
    - Involves both large and small peripheral joints.
    - Episodes last a few days to several weeks and resolve spontaneously.
    - Resolves without joint erosion or deformity.
    - Attacks may not be temporally related to other manifestations.
    - Joint fluid reported as noninflammatory.
    - May involve costochondral, sternomanubrial, and sternoclavicular cartilages.
    - Destruction of these cartilages may result in a pectus excavatum deformity or flail anterior chest wall.
- **Eye manifestations** occur in >one-half of patients.
    - Include conjunctivitis, episcleritis, scleritis, iritis, uveitis, keratitis.
    - Ocular inflammation can be severe and visually threatening.
    - Other manifestations: eyelid and periorbital edema, proptosis, optic neuritis, extraocular muscle palsies, retinal vasculitis, renal vein occlusion.
- **Laryngotracheobronchial involvement** occurs in ~50% of patients and is among the most serious manifestations.
    - Symptoms: hoarseness, nonproductive cough, tenderness over larynx and proximal trachea.
    - Mucosal edema, strictures, and/or collapse of laryngeal or tracheal cartilage may cause **stridor and life-threatening airway obstruction**.
    - May necessitate tracheostomy.
    - Involvement can extend into lower airways resulting in tracheobronchomalacia.
    - Collapse of cartilage in bronchi leads to pneumonia.
    - When extensive, collapse leads to respiratory insufficiency.
- **Cardiac valvular regurgitation** occurs in ~5–10% of patients.
    - Due to progressive dilation of valvular ring or destruction of valve cusps.
    - Aortic regurgitation in ~7%, mitral and other valves less often.
    - Other cardiac manifestations: pericarditis, myocarditis, coronary vasculitis, conduction abnormalities.
    - Aneurysms of proximal, thoracic, or abdominal aorta may occur (even without active chondritis) and occasionally rupture.
- **Renal disease** occurs in ~10% of patients.
    - Most common lesions: mesangial expansion or segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis.
    - Often have small amounts of electron-dense deposits in mesangium with faint deposition of C3 and/or IgG or IgM.
    - Tubulointerstitial disease and IgA nephropathy also reported.
- Approximately 25% of patients have **skin lesions**.
    - Can include purpura, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, angioedema/urticaria, livedo reticularis, panniculitis.
- Features of **vasculitis** seen in up to 25% of patients.
    - Can affect any size vessel.
    - Large vessel vasculitis may present with aortic aneurysms.
    - Medium vessel disease may affect coronary, hepatic, mesenteric, or renal arteries or vessel-supplying nerves.
    - Cutaneous vasculitis can also occur.
    - Variety of primary vasculitides reported in association (e.g., discussed in Chap. 363).
    - **MAGIC syndrome** (mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage) is an overlap.
        - Patients present with features of both relapsing polychondritis and Behçet’s disease (discussed in Chap. 364).
- Associated with **VEXAS syndrome** (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic).
    - Should be considered in male patients with relapsing polychondritis who have: hematologic abnormalities (often myelodysplastic syndrome spectrum), fevers, venous thrombotic events, pulmonary infiltrates, cutaneous lesions, or treatment-resistant disease.
    - Strongly suggested by clinical features and vacuoles within bone marrow precursor cells.
    - Proven by genetic testing for myeloid-restricted somatic missense mutations in UBA1 (major E1 enzyme initiating ubiquitylation).

## Laboratory Findings and Diagnostic Imaging

- **No diagnostic laboratory features** for relapsing polychondritis.
- Mild leukocytosis and normocytic, normochromic anemia are often present.
- Eosinophilia observed in 10%.
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are usually elevated.
- Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody tests are occasionally positive in low titers.
- Complement levels are normal.
- Antibodies to type II collagen are present in one-half of patients and are not specific.
- Circulating immune complexes may be detected, especially in patients with early active disease.
- Elevated levels of γ globulin may be present.
- Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), cytoplasmic (cANCA) or perinuclear (pANCA), found in some patients with active disease.
    - On target antigen–specific testing, only occasional reports of positive myeloperoxidase-ANCA.
    - Proteinase 3-ANCA are very rarely found.
- Upper and lower airways can be evaluated by imaging techniques like CT and MR.
- **Dynamic inspiratory and expiratory CT** useful in assessing airway involvement.
- Bronchoscopy provides direct visualization but can be high-risk in patients with airway compromise.
- Pulmonary function testing with flow-volume loops can show inspiratory and/or expiratory obstruction.
- Imaging useful to detect extracartilaginous disease.
- Arteriography by CT or MR should be pursued if features suggest aortic or other large vessel involvement.
- Electrocardiography and echocardiography useful for evaluating cardiac features.
- Use of positron emission tomography reported, but unclear if useful and for what features.

## Diagnosis

- Diagnosis is based on recognition of the **typical clinical features**.
- Biopsies of involved cartilage (ear, nose, respiratory tract) can confirm diagnosis.
    - Only necessary when clinical features are not typical.
    - May be difficult to obtain.
- Diagnostic criteria suggested by McAdam et al (1976).
    - Included biopsy evidence combined with three of the following:
        1. Recurrent chondritis of both auricles.
        2. Nonerosive inflammatory arthritis.
        3. Chondritis of nasal cartilage.
        4. Inflammation of ocular structures (conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis/episcleritis, uveitis).
        5. Chondritis of laryngeal and/or tracheal cartilages.
        6. Cochlear and/or vestibular damage (neurosensory hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo).
- Damiani and Levine suggested (1979) diagnosis could be made when:
    - One or more of the above features and a positive biopsy were present.
    - Two or more separate sites of cartilage inflammation were present that responded to treatment.
    - Three or more of the above features were present.

## Differential Diagnosis

- Centered around sites of clinical involvement.
- **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: may have saddle nose and tracheal involvement.
    - Distinguished by primary inflammation in mucosa, **absence of auricular involvement**, presence of pulmonary parenchymal disease.
- **Cogan’s syndrome**: interstitial keratitis and vestibular/auditory abnormalities.
    - Does not involve the respiratory tract or ears.
- **Reactive arthritis**: may resemble relapsing polychondritis initially (oligoarticular arthritis, eye involvement).
    - Distinguished by urethritis, typical mucocutaneous lesions, **absence of nose or ear cartilage involvement**.
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: may suggest relapsing polychondritis (arthritis, eye inflammation).
    - Arthritis is erosive and symmetric.
    - Rheumatoid factor titers usually high (low in relapsing polychondritis).
    - Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide usually not seen.
- **Bacterial infection of the pinna**: may be mistaken for relapsing polychondritis.
    - Differs by usually involving **only one ear**, including the earlobe.
- Auricular cartilage may also be damaged by trauma or frostbite.
- **Cocaine use adulterated with levamisole**: can cause nasal destructive disease and auricular abnormalities.
    - Ear involvement differs from relapsing polychondritis by typically manifesting as purpuric plaques with necrosis extending to the earlobe (which lacks cartilage).

## Treatment

- For active chondritis, **prednisone 40–60 mg/d** is often effective.
    - Tapered gradually once disease is controlled.
    - Some patients can stop prednisone, others need low doses (5–10 mg/d) for continued suppression.
- Other immunosuppressive drugs (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine) should be used in patients with:
    - Severe organ-threatening disease.
    - Failure to respond to prednisone.
    - Requirement for high doses to control disease activity.
- Significant interest in biologic agents.
    - Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors most widely examined, benefit suggested from retrospective cases/series.
    - Other agents with published reports include anakinra, rituximab, tocilizumab, abatacept, but reports too few to assess efficacy.
- Dapsone used in selected settings but largely supplanted.
    - Should not be used for severe disease.
- Heart valve replacement or repair of aortic aneurysm may be necessary.
- When airway obstruction is severe, **tracheostomy is required**.
- Stents may be necessary in patients with tracheobronchial collapse.

## Patient Outcome, Prognosis, and Survival

- Course is **highly variable**.
- Some experience inflammatory episodes lasting days to weeks, subsiding spontaneously or with treatment.
    - Attacks may recur at intervals from weeks to months.
- In others, disease has a chronic, smoldering course that may be severe.
- In one study, **5-year estimated survival rate was 74%**.
- **10-year survival rate was 55%**.
- About one-half of deaths attributed to relapsing polychondritis or complications of treatment.
- **Airway complications accounted for 10% of all fatalities** (higher rates reported in other series).
- Patients with more widespread disease generally have a worse prognosis.

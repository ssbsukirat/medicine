# Spondyloarthritis

- Spondyloarthritis (SpA) refers to a group of overlapping disorders.
- These disorders share clinical features, genetic associations, and pathogenic mechanisms.
- Classic designations include: **ankylosing spondylitis (AS)**, reactive arthritis (ReA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), juvenile spondyloarthritis (JSpA), and undifferentiated SpA.
- SpA disorders are broadly classified as predominantly axial SpA (affecting the spine, pelvis, thoracic cage) or predominantly peripheral SpA (affecting the extremities).

# ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS AND AXIAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS

- **Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)** is the current term for the most common inflammatory disorder affecting the axial skeleton.
- AxSpA has variable involvement of peripheral joints and extraarticular structures.
- AxSpA includes patients with significant radiographic damage of the sacroiliac joints, classically termed AS and now considered **radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA)**.
- AxSpA also includes patients with a similar clinical presentation but lacking significant radiographic sacroiliitis.
- Some patients without significant radiographic sacroiliitis eventually develop it, but many do not.
- The concept of axSpA is supported by classification criteria formulated in 2009 (Table 362-1).
	- ![[ASdiagnostic.png]]
- AxSpA patients with sacroiliitis on MRI but without significant damage on x-ray are categorized as having **nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA)**.

## TABLE 362-1 ASAS Criteria for Classification of Axial Spondyloarthritis

- Applied for patients with back pain ≥3 months and age of onset <45 years.

## EPIDEMIOLOGY

- Estimated adult prevalence of AS in 20 countries is ∼0.17% (range 0.02–0.5%).
- Prevalence of ax-SpA is ∼1.3- to 2-fold higher than that of AS.
- AS shows a striking correlation with the **histocompatibility antigen HLA-B27** and occurs worldwide roughly in proportion to the prevalence of B27.
- In North American whites, prevalence of B27 is 6%, whereas it is 80–90% in patients with AS.
- In population surveys, AS is found in 1–6% of adults inheriting B27.
- Prevalence is 10–30% among B27+ adult first-degree relatives of AS probands.
- Concordance rate in identical twins is about 65%.
- Susceptibility to AS is determined largely by **genetic factors**.
- B27 comprises ∼20% of the genetic component.
- Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis identified 115 additional non-HLA alleles contributing another ∼7–8% of genetic susceptibility.
- Prevalence of HLA-B27 in nr-axSpA is somewhat lower than in AS.
- Proportion of females is higher in nr-axSpA.
- Nr-axSpA is genetically more heterogeneous than AS.

## PATHOLOGY

- **Sacroiliitis** is typically an early manifestation of axSpA, whether or not evident radiographically.
- Biopsy/autopsy studies of sacroiliac joints show earliest changes: synovitis and myxoid marrow.
- These are followed by pannus and subchondral granulation tissue.
- Marrow edema, enthesitis, and chondroid differentiation are also found.
- Macrophages, T cells, plasma cells, and osteoclasts are prevalent.
- If process progresses, eroded joint margins are replaced by fibrocartilage regeneration, then ossification.
- In the spine, inflammatory granulation tissue is seen in paravertebral connective tissue at the junction of annulus fibrosus and vertebral bone, or along the outer annulus.
- Outer annular fibers are eroded and eventually replaced by bone, forming an early **syndesmophyte**.
- Syndesmophyte grows by endochondral ossification, ultimately bridging adjacent vertebral bodies (Fig. 362-1F, G).
- Progression can lead to “**bamboo spine**”.
- Other spinal lesions include: osteoporosis (loss of trabecular bone despite periosteal bone accretion), erosion of vertebral bodies at the disk margin, inflammation and destruction of the disk-bone border.
- Inflammatory arthritis of the facet joints is common.
- Erosion of facet joint cartilage by pannus often followed by bony ankylosis.
- This may precede syndesmophyte formation bridging adjacent disks.
- Bone mineral density is diminished in the spine and proximal femur early in the disease course.
- Peripheral synovitis in AS shows marked vascularity, lining layer hyperplasia, lymphoid infiltration, and pannus formation.
- Central cartilaginous erosions from proliferation of subchondral granulation tissue are common.
- Characteristics of peripheral arthritis in AS are shared by other SpA forms and distinct from RA.
- The **enthesis** (fibrocartilaginous region where tendon, ligament, or joint capsule attaches to bone) is implicated as a primary site of pathology in AS and other SpAs.
- Entheses transduce mechanical forces and are widely distributed.
- Enthesitis is associated with prominent edema of adjacent bone marrow.
- It is often characterized by erosive lesions that eventually undergo ossification.
- Subclinical intestinal inflammation is found in the colon or distal ileum in most SpA patients.
- Histology resembles IBD-associated arthritis.

## PATHOGENESIS

- AS is immune-mediated.
- Increasing evidence suggests an **autoinflammatory** rather than antigen-specific autoimmune pathogenesis.
- Uncertainty remains regarding the primary site of disease initiation.
- Dramatic response to therapeutic blockade of **tumor necrosis factor (TNF)** or **IL-17A** indicates their central immunopathogenic role.
- Genes related to TNF pathways associated with AS: TNFRSF1A, TNFAIP3, LTBR, TBKBP1.
- Genes in the IL-23/IL-17 pathway associated with AS: IL23R, PTER4, IL12B, CARD9, IL6R, TYK2, JAK2, STAT3.
- 11 of these 12 genes are also associated with IBD.
- 6 are also associated with psoriasis.
- Serum levels of IL-23 and IL-17 are elevated in AS patients.
- In mice, tissue-resident γ/δ T cells expressing IL-23 receptors are found at entheses, aortic root, and near ciliary body in the eye.
- These cells express abundant IL-17 and IL-22 upon exposure to systemic IL-23.
- This suggests site-specific innate immune cells play a critical role in anatomic specificity.
- IL-23 signals through Janus kinase (Jak) TYK2.
- TYK2 loss of function SNPs are protective against AS.
- Tyk2 inhibition blocks IL-23-dependent immunity and SpA progression in a mouse model.
- High levels of circulating γδ T cells expressing IL-23 receptors and producing IL-17 found in AS patients.
- Human spinal entheses studies identified IL-23-producing CD14+ myeloid cells and IL-17A-producing γδ-T cells.
- One subset of γδ-T cells lacked IL-23 receptors and may produce IL-17A independently of IL-23.
- This may explain therapeutic failure of IL-23 agents in ax-SpA despite response in peripheral SpA and dramatic response to IL-17A agents (Fig. 362-3).
- Other associated genes encode cytokines/receptors (IL1R1, IL1R2, IL7R, IL27).
- Other associated genes encode transcription factors for immune cell differentiation (RUNX3, EOMES, BACH2, NKX2-3, TBX21).
- Other associated genes encode molecules involved in immune/inflammatory responses (FCGR2A, ZMIZ1, NOS2, ICOSLG).
- Inflamed sacroiliac joint is infiltrated with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages.
- It shows high TNF levels, particularly early.
- Abundant transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is found in more advanced lesions.
- Peripheral synovitis in SpA is characterized by neutrophils, CD68/CD163 macrophages, CD4+/CD8+ T cells, and B cells.
- Prominent staining for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, MMP-3, MRP-8, MRP-14.
- **Gut microbiota dysbiosis** is consistently found in SpA patients and animal models.
- Dysbiosis may be influenced by HLA genotype, including HLA-B27.
- Bacteria species with mucolytic properties are expanded in patients.
- Overlapping features with ReA and IBD and involvement of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway support microbiome importance.
- Hypothesized amplification loop: systemic inflammation, dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability drive sustained inflammation.
- **HLA-B27** plays a direct role, precise molecular role unresolved.
- B27 transgenic rats develop arthritis/spondylitis, unaffected by CD8 absence.
- Classical peptide antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells may not be primary mechanism.
- Association with ERAP1/ERAP2 suggests peptide binding to B27 is important.
- CD8+ T cells decreased in peripheral blood, increased in synovial fluid in AS; role unclear.
- B27 heavy chain has unusual tendency to misfold, which can be proinflammatory.
- Genetic/functional studies suggest a role for natural killer (NK) cells, possibly via B27 heavy chain homodimers.
- SpA-prone B27 rats show defective dendritic cell function.
- They share a characteristic “reverse interferon” gene expression signature in antigen-presenting cells with AS patients.
- Recent study found evidence for interaction between HLA-B27 and activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2).
- ALK2 mutations associated with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (uncontrolled bone formation).
- Enthesitis can arise in healthy individuals from repetitive mechanical strain.
- In SpA, the threshold for strain-induced entheseal inflammation is thought to be lowered by genetic factors and/or microbial products.
- This results in widespread, chronic lesions at entheseal sites subjected to normal use.
- TNF transgenic mice develop peripheral enthesitis/arthritis mediated by innate immunity.
- Nonweightbearing reduces inflammation/new bone formation at these sites in mice.
- **New bone formation** in AS appears largely based on enchondral bone formation.
- Occurs only in the periosteal compartment.
- Correlates with lack of regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by inhibitors DKK-1 and sclerostin.
- Indirect evidence/animal data implicate bone morphogenic proteins, hedgehog proteins, prostaglandin E2.
- Patients with high inflammatory markers and inflammation at vertebral corners on MRI are most likely to develop syndesmophytes.
- Early and prolonged anti-TNF therapy may decrease spinal fusion.
- Vertebral inflammatory lesions that undergo metaplasia to fat are preferential sites of subsequent syndesmophyte formation despite anti-TNF.
- Early acute inflammatory lesions resolve.
- This reinforces the importance of early treatment to resolve inflammation.

## CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

- Initial AS symptoms usually first noticed in late adolescence or early adulthood.
- Median age in mid-twenties.
- In 5%, symptoms begin after age 40.
- Initial symptom: pain (sharp or dull), insidious onset, felt deep in lower lumbar or gluteal region.
- Accompanied by low-back morning stiffness up to a few hours.
- Stiffness improves with activity and returns following inactivity.
- Within months, pain usually becomes persistent and bilateral.
- Nocturnal exacerbation often forces patient to rise and move around.
- **Bony tenderness** (enthesitis/osteitis) may accompany back pain/stiffness or be predominant.
- Common sites: costosternal junctions, spinous processes, iliac crests, greater trochanters, ischial tuberosities, tibial tubercles, heels.
- **Hip and shoulder** (“root” joint) arthritis is part of axial disease.
- Hip arthritis occurs in 25–35%.
- Severe isolated hip arthritis or bony chest pain may be presenting complaint.
- Symptomatic hip disease can dominate, especially in juvenile-onset disease.
- **Peripheral arthritis** is usually asymmetric and can occur any point in course.
- Neck pain and stiffness (cervical spine) may be later manifestations, occasionally dominant.
- **Chest pain** is common at any stage of ax-SpA, can be confused with cardiovascular disease.
- In juvenile spondyloarthritis, peripheral arthritis and enthesitis predominate.
- Axial symptoms supervene in late adolescence.
- Initially, axial physical findings mirror inflammation.
- Most specific findings involve **loss of spinal mobility** (lumbar flexion/lateral flexion/extension, chest expansion).
- Limitation often out of proportion to bony ankylosis, may reflect muscle spasm.
- Sacroiliac joint pain elicited by direct pressure or stress.
- Tenderness common upon palpation of posterior spinous processes and other bony tender sites.
- **Modified Schober test** measures lumbar spine flexion.
- Normal mobility shows ≥2 cm increase.
- **Chest expansion** measured at 4th intercostal space or xiphisternum.
- Normal is ≥2.5 cm.
- Lateral bending measures middle finger travel down leg.
- Normal is >10 cm.
- Limitation/pain with motion of hips/shoulders if involved.
- In early, mild, atypical cases, symptoms/physical findings may be subtle/nonspecific.
- Course of ax-SpA is extremely variable.
- Ranges from mild stiffness/normal radiographs to totally fused spine/severe hip/peripheral arthritis/extraarticular manifestations.
- Natural history data predominantly pertain to AS.
- Prevalence of peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, psoriasis, IBD appears similar in nr-axSpA and AS.
- Pain tends to be persistent early, intermittent later, with alternating exacerbations/quiescent periods.
- Severe untreated case with progression to syndesmophyte formation shows characteristic posture changes.
- Posture changes: obliterated lumbar lordosis, buttock atrophy, accentuated thoracic kyphosis.
- May have forward stoop of neck or hip flexion contractures, compensated by knee flexion.
- Disease progression estimated clinically: loss of height, limitation of chest expansion/spinal flexion, increasing occiput-to-wall distance.
- Occasional individuals with advanced deformities deny significant symptoms.
- Factors most predictive of radiographic progression: presence of existing syndesmophytes, high inflammatory markers, smoking.
- Some studies correlate adolescent onset and early hip involvement with worse prognosis.
- In women, AS tends to progress less frequently to total spinal ankylosis.
- Women may have increased prevalence of peripheral arthritis.
- Peripheral arthritis occurs in up to 30%.
- Pregnancy has no consistent effect on AS.
- Those requiring biologic therapy before pregnancy are likely to flare if medication is discontinued in 2nd/3rd trimester.
- Most serious complication of advanced spinal disease: **spinal fracture**.
- Fractures can occur with minor trauma to rigid, osteoporotic spine.
- Lower cervical spine most commonly involved.
- Fractures are often displaced, causing spinal cord injury.
- Lifetime risk of fracture suggested to be >10%.
- Fracture through a diskovertebral junction/adjacent neural arch (pseudoarthrosis) is rare.
- Pseudoarthrosis is most common in thoracolumbar spine.
- Can be unrecognized source of persistent localized pain/neurologic dysfunction.
- Wedging of thoracic vertebrae can lead to accentuated kyphosis.
- Most common extraarticular manifestation: **acute anterior uveitis**.
- Uveitis occurs in up to 50%, can antedate spondylitis.
- Attacks typically unilateral, causing pain, photophobia, pain with accommodation.
- May recur, often in the opposite eye.
- Cataracts and secondary glaucoma may ensue.
- Up to 60% of AS patients have inflammation in colon or ileum.
- Usually asymptomatic, but overt IBD occurs in 5–10% of AS patients.
- About 10% of patients meeting AS criteria have psoriasis.
- Occasional patients with AS associated with skin manifestations seen in SAPHO syndrome (acne fulminans, hidradenitis suppurativa).
- Apparently increased risk of ischemic heart disease.
- Aortic insufficiency occurs in small percentage, usually after longstanding disease.
- Third-degree heart block may occur alone or with aortic insufficiency.
- Association with lesser degrees of heart block described.
- Cauda equina syndrome and upper pulmonary lobe fibrosis are rare late complications.
- Prostatitis reported to have increased prevalence.
- Amyloidosis is rare.
- Validated measures of disease activity/functional outcome used: Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI).
- Assessment of Spondyloarthritis international Society (ASAS) Health Index is SpA-specific tool for assessing function/health impairment.
- Despite disease persistence, most patients remain gainfully employed.
- Some studies suggest AS shortens life span.
- Mortality largely results from spinal trauma, aortic insufficiency, respiratory failure, amyloid nephropathy, complications of therapy (e.g., upper GI hemorrhage).
- Impact of biologic therapy on outcome/mortality not yet known, except for significantly improved work productivity.

## LABORATORY FINDINGS

- **No laboratory test is diagnostic of AS**.
- In most ethnic groups, HLA-B27 present in 75–90% of patients.
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often, but not always, elevated.
- Mild anemia may be present.
- Severe disease may show elevated alkaline phosphatase.
- Elevated serum IgA is common.
- Rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are largely absent unless coexistent disease.
- ANAs may appear with anti-TNF therapy.
- Circulating CD8+ T cell levels tend to be low.
- Serum matrix metalloproteinase 3 levels correlate with disease activity.
- Synovial fluid from peripheral joints is nonspecifically inflammatory.
- Restricted chest wall motion causes decreased vital capacity.
- Ventilatory function usually well maintained.

## RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS (Fig. 362-1)

- Diagnosis of AS associated with **advanced radiographically demonstrable sacroiliitis**, usually symmetric.
- Earliest standard radiography changes: blurring of cortical margins of subchondral bone, followed by erosions and sclerosis.
- Progression of erosions leads to “pseudowidening” of joint space.
- As fibrous then bony ankylosis supervenes, joints may become obliterated.
- In lumbar spine, progression leads to loss of lordosis.
- Osteitis of anterior corners of vertebral bodies with subsequent erosion.
- New bone formation causing “squaring” or “barreling” of vertebral bodies.
- Progressive ossification leads to marginal syndesmophyte formation.
- Syndesmophytes visible on plain films as bony bridges connecting successive vertebral bodies anteriorly and laterally.
- Only a minority of nr-axSpA patients develop radiographic sacroiliitis within a decade or more.
- Even fewer develop spinal changes.
- **MRI is much more useful for timely diagnosis of ax-SpA**.
- Requires appropriate protocol and expertise.
- Routine low back pain MRI protocols have low sensitivity, often false-negative.
- Active sacroiliitis best visualized by dynamic MRI on semicoronal slices with fat saturation (T2-weighted turbo spin-echo or STIR) with high resolution, or T1-weighted with contrast.
- These techniques identify early intraarticular inflammation, cartilage changes, bone marrow edema in sacroiliitis (Fig. 362-1).
- Protocols also sensitive for acute/chronic spinal changes.
- Bone marrow edema alone is not specific for spondyloarthritis.
- Presence of erosions enhances specificity, best detected on conventional T1-weighted images.
- Optimal MRI results require high index of suspicion, appropriate protocol, experienced radiologist, close communication.
- Reduced bone mineral density detected by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of femoral neck/lumbar spine.
- Lateral projection of L3 vertebral body prevents falsely elevated readings from spinal ossification.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Important to recognize ax-SpA before irreversible deformity.
- Challenging because: minority of back pain patients have ax-SpA.
- Early diagnosis relies on clinical grounds and/or appropriate MRI protocol requiring expertise.
- Young individuals with ax-SpA symptoms often do not seek medical care.
- Reliance on definite radiographic sacroiliitis causes early/mild cases to be missed.
- Classification criteria for ax-SpA proposed by ASAS are for research, not strict diagnostic criteria, but an aid.
- Applicable to individuals with ≥3 months back pain, age of onset <45 years.
- Active sacroiliitis on MRI is equivalent to definite radiographic sacroiliitis.
- AxSpA must be differentiated from numerous other causes of low-back pain, some more common.
- Increased specificity when considering pain nature/pattern and patient age.
- Most typical symptom: **inflammatory back pain (IBP)**, present in 70–80% of axSpA patients.
- IBP features in chronic (≥3 months) back pain: age of onset <40 years.
- Insidious onset.
- Improvement with exercise.
- No improvement with rest.
- Pain at night with improvement upon getting up.
- Morning stiffness >30 min.
- Awakening from back pain during only the second half of the night.
- Alternating buttock pain.
- Two or more features should arouse suspicion for IBP; four or more are presumptively diagnostic.
- Most common back pain causes other than SpA are mechanical or degenerative.
- These are less likely to show clustering of SpA features.
- IBP can be present in up to 30% of patients with mechanical back pain.
- Less common causes to differentiate from axSpA: infectious spondylitis, spondylodiskitis, sacroiliitis.
- Primary or metastatic tumor.
- Ochronosis can produce a phenotype similar to AS.
- Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) occurs in middle age+, usually asymptomatic.
- DISH: calcification/ossification of paraspinous ligaments, “flowing wax” on anterior vertebral bodies.
- DISH: intervertebral disk spaces preserved, sacroiliac/facet joints normal, helps differentiate from spondylosis/AS.
- Primary/secondary hyperparathyroidism can cause subchondral bone resorption around SI joints.
- Hyperparathyroidism: bilateral widened/ill-defined SI joints on radiographs, but without joint space narrowing.
- Algorithm for diagnosis/exclusion of ax-SpA in chronic back pain (Fig. 362-2).

## TREATMENT

### Axial Spondyloarthritis

- All management should include an exercise program to maintain posture/range of motion.
- Exercise videos available from Spondylitis Association of America.
- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** are first-line pharmacologic therapy.
- Reduce pain/tenderness, increase mobility in many.
- Continuous high-dose NSAID therapy may slow radiographic progression, especially in high-risk patients.
- Many patients have persistent symptoms despite NSAIDs and may benefit from biologic therapy.
- Patients with AS treated with **anti-TNF agents** show rapid, profound, sustained reductions in clinical/lab measures.
- Anti-TNF agents: infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol.
- Good response: significant improvement in objective/subjective indicators (morning stiffness, pain, mobility, swelling, CRP, ESR, bone mineral density).
- MRI studies show substantial resolution of bone marrow edema, enthesitis, joint effusions.
- Results obtained in large randomized controlled trials and open-label studies.
- About half of patients achieve ≥50% reduction in BASDAI.
- Response tends to persist, symptom remission feasible in a proportion.
- Predictors of best responses: younger age, shorter disease duration, higher baseline inflammatory markers, lower baseline functional disability.
- Some patients with long-standing disease/ankylosis obtain significant benefit.
- Greater chance of slowing syndesmophyte formation with sustained therapy, especially if started early.
- Response of nr-axSpA patients to anti-TNF is generally similar to AS.
- Anti-TNF dosing regimens described for infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol.
- Dosage adjustments considered in selected cases.
- Anti-TNF agents are potent immunosuppressives.
- Patients at increased risk for serious infections, including disseminated TB.
- Hypersensitivity infusion/injection site reactions not uncommon.
- Anti-TNF-induced psoriasis increasingly recognized.
- Rare cases of SLE-related disease reported.
- Hematologic disorders (pancytopenia), demyelinating disorders, exacerbation of congestive heart failure, severe liver disease reported.
- Overall incidence of malignancy not increased, but isolated hematologic malignancy cases occurred shortly after initiation.
- Use restricted to patients with definite diagnosis and active disease inadequately responsive to ≥2 NSAIDs.
- Before anti-TNF, test for latent TB and hepatitis B, treat appropriately.
- Contraindications to TNF inhibitors: active infection or high risk, multiple sclerosis.
- History of hematologic malignancy, SLE, or related autoimmunity.
- Pregnancy and breast-feeding not contraindications if precautions taken.
- Certolizumab pegol label indicates minimal transplacental/breast milk transfer.
- Infants exposed in utero should not receive live vaccines before 6 months.
- Switching to a second anti-TNF may be effective, especially after response loss vs primary failure.
- **Secukinumab (anti-IL-17A)** and **ixekizumab (anti-IL-17A)** are FDA-approved for AS.
- Show efficacy similar to anti-TNF.
- Effective in patients who failed/not tolerated anti-TNF, and naïve patients.
- Both effective in nr-axSpA.
- Recommended doses for secukinumab and ixekizumab described.
- Precautions regarding infection similar to anti-TNF.
- Additional concern: potential exacerbation of underlying IBD, careful monitoring advised.
- Antibodies targeting IL-23 (ustakinumab, risankizumab) failed to show efficacy in AS.
- IL-23 agents show efficacy in psoriatic arthritis (Fig. 362-3).
- Sulfasalazine (2–3 g/d) used for peripheral arthritis.
- Methotrexate not shown beneficial in AS.
- No therapeutic role for oral glucocorticoids documented in AS.
- **Oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors** (tofacitinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib) have shown efficacy in AS trials.
- Show reduction of inflammation on MRI.
- Further clinical trials in progress.
- Precautions regarding infection similar to anti-TNF, additional concern for herpes zoster.
- Most common surgery indication: severe hip joint arthritis.
- Total hip arthroplasty usually relieves pain/stiffness dramatically.
- Rare patients benefit from surgical correction of extreme flexion deformities of spine or atlantoaxial subluxation.
- Uveitis attacks usually managed with local glucocorticoids and mydriatic agents.
- Systemic glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives, or anti-TNF may be required.
- TNF inhibitors may reduce frequency of uveitis attacks.
- New or recurrent uveitis observed with TNF inhibitors, especially etanercept.
- Adalimumab is FDA approved for intermediate, posterior, panuveitis (rare in AS, not unusual in PsA/IBD-associated).
- Anti-IL-17A agents not directly studied for SpA-associated uveitis, but secukinumab trials showed no increased incidence.
- **Spinal manipulation strongly discouraged**, dangerous in osteoporosis/structural lesions.
- Management of axial osteoporosis similar to primary osteoporosis.

# REACTIVE ARTHRITIS

- ReA refers to **acute nonpurulent arthritis complicating an infection elsewhere**.
- Primarily refers to SpA following enteric or urogenital infections.
- Other infection-related arthritis (Lyme, rheumatic fever, poststreptococcal) not associated with B27 and different spectrum.

## HISTORIC BACKGROUND

- Association of acute arthritis with diarrhea/urethritis recognized for centuries.
- High incidence during WWI/WWII focused attention on triad: arthritis, urethritis, conjunctivitis (often with mucocutaneous lesions).
- Known by now historic eponyms.
- Identification of bacterial triggers and association with HLA-B27 led to unifying concept.
- ReA is a clinical syndrome triggered by specific etiologic agents in a genetically susceptible host.
- Characteristic spectrum triggered by: enteric infection (certain Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter).
- Genital infection (Chlamydia trachomatis).
- Many other agents, apparently via nasopharyngeal infection (Chlamydia pneumoniae).
- The “classic triad” represents a small part of spectrum, present in a small minority.
- Term ReA restricted to SpA cases with at least presumptive evidence for a related antecedent infection.

## EPIDEMIOLOGY

- Early reports: 60–85% of Shigella, Yersinia, Chlamydia-triggered ReA patients were HLA-B27-positive.
- Lower B27 prevalence in Salmonella-triggered ReA.
- Little/no B27 association in Campylobacter-induced ReA.
- Recent studies show overall B27 prevalence in ReA <50%.
- Most common age range: 18–40 years.
- Can occur in children and older adults.
- Reported attack rate of postenteric ReA: 1% to ∼30% (depends on study/organism).
- Attack rate of postchlamydial ReA: ∼4–8%.
- Gender ratio following enteric infection is nearly 1:1.
- Venereally acquired ReA occurs mainly in men.
- Overall prevalence/incidence difficult to assess (lack of validated criteria, variable triggers/susceptibility).
- Scandinavia reported annual incidence of 10–28:100,000.
- SpA formerly almost unknown in sub-Saharan Africa.
- ReA and other peripheral SpAs became common in black Africans following AIDS epidemic, without B27 association (rare in these pops).
- In Africans, ReA often first manifestation of HIV, often remits with disease progression.
- Western white patients with HIV and SpA usually B27-positive, arthritis flares as AIDS advances.

## PATHOLOGY

- Synovial histology similar to other SpAs.
- Enthesitis shows increased vascularity, macrophage infiltration of fibrocartilage.
- Microscopic histopathologic evidence of inflammation mimicking IBD routinely shown in colon/ileum of postenteric ReA patients.
- Less common in postvenereal ReA.
- Skin lesions of keratoderma blennorrhagica are histologically indistinguishable from pustular psoriasis.

## ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- **Definite bacterial triggers**: Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Chlamydia trachomatis.
- All are gram-negative bacteria containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
- All Shigella species implicated, S. flexneri and S. sonnei most common.
- Yersinia species in Europe/Scandinavia may have greater arthritogenic potential.
- C. trachomatis appears a common trigger worldwide.
- Ocular serovars of C. trachomatis appear particularly/uniquely arthritogenic.
- Evidence implicating Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter coli, certain toxigenic Escherichia coli, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma genitalium as potential triggers.
- Chlamydia pneumoniae can trigger ReA, but less commonly than C. trachomatis.
- Numerous isolated reports of arthritis following other bacterial, viral, parasitic infections.
- Arthritis following intravesicular bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment for bladder cancer is well documented.
- Common pathogenic mechanism for triggering by all microbes is not known.
- Mechanism not elucidated for any particular trigger.
- Established triggers share capacity to attack mucosal surfaces, invade host cells, survive intracellularly.
- Antigens from Chlamydia, Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella found in synovium/synovial fluid leukocytes long after acute attack.
- Y. enterocolitica-triggered ReA: bacterial LPS and heat-shock protein antigens found in peripheral blood cells years later.
- Yersinia DNA and C. trachomatis DNA/RNA detected in synovial tissue.
- Suggests presence of viable organisms despite failure to culture.
- Specificity unclear as chromosomal bacterial DNA/16S rRNA from wide variety found in synovium in other rheumatic diseases, less frequently.
- Recent work documented high levels of **IL-17 in ReA synovial fluid**, source not identified.
- HLA-B27 seems associated with more severe/chronic ReA, pathogenic role undetermined.
- HLA-B27 significantly prolongs intracellular survival of Y. enterocolitica and S. enteritidis.
- May permit trafficking of infected leukocytes to joints.
- In joints, innate/adaptive immune response to persistent antigens may promote arthritis.
- 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of intestinal microbiota: higher abundance of Erwinia/Pseudomonas species, increased prevalence of typical enteropathogens in ReA patients.
- Correlations found between specific bacteria and disease manifestations.
- HLA correlation with microbiome diversity found.

## CLINICAL FEATURES

- Manifestations range from isolated transient monoarthritis/enthesitis to severe multisystem disease.
- Careful history often elicits evidence of antecedent infection 1–4 weeks before onset, particularly postenteric ReA.
- Sizable minority have no clinical/lab evidence of antecedent infection, particularly postchlamydial ReA.
- Presumed venereally acquired reactive disease often history of recent new sexual partner.
- **Constitutional symptoms** common: fatigue, malaise, fever, weight loss.
- Musculoskeletal symptoms usually acute onset.
- **Arthritis** usually asymmetric and additive, new joints over days to 1–2 weeks.
- Lower extremity joints most commonly involved (knee, ankle, subtalar, metatarsophalangeal, toe interphalangeal).
- Wrist and fingers may be involved.
- Arthritis usually painful, tense joint effusions not uncommon (especially knee).
- **Dactylitis** (“sausage digit”) is a distinctive feature of ReA and PsA.
- Can be seen in polyarticular gout and sarcoidosis.
- **Tendinitis and fasciitis** are characteristic lesions, producing pain at multiple entheses.
- Especially Achilles insertion, plantar fascia, sites along axial skeleton.
- Back and buttock pain common.
- May be caused by insertional inflammation, muscle spasm, acute sacroiliitis, or presumably arthritis in intervertebral joints.
- **Urogenital lesions** may occur throughout course.
- In men, urethritis may be marked or asymptomatic.
- May be accompaniment of triggering infection or result of reactive phase.
- Occurs in both postvenereal and postenteric ReA.
- Prostatitis common.
- In women, cervicitis or salpingitis may be caused by infectious trigger or sterile reactive process.
- **Ocular disease** common.
- Ranges from transient asymptomatic conjunctivitis to aggressive anterior uveitis.
- Uveitis occasionally refractory to treatment, may result in blindness.
- **Mucocutaneous lesions** frequent.
- Oral ulcers tend to be superficial, transient, often asymptomatic.
- Characteristic skin lesion: **keratoderma blennorrhagica**.
- Vesicles/pustules become hyperkeratotic, form a crust before disappearing.
- Most common on palms and soles, may occur elsewhere.
- In HIV patients, these lesions often severe/extensive.
- Lesions on glans penis: **circinate balanitis**.
- Vesicles quickly rupture to form painless superficial erosions.
- In circumcised individuals, can form crusts similar to keratoderma blennorrhagica.
- **Nail changes** common: onycholysis, distal yellowish discoloration, heaped-up hyperkeratosis.
- Less frequent/rare manifestations: cardiac conduction defects, aortic insufficiency, central/peripheral nervous system lesions, pleuropulmonary infiltrates.
- In resolving cases, arthritis typically lasts 3–5 months.
- Chronic joint symptoms persist in about 15% of patients, up to 60% in hospital series.
- Chronic symptoms tend to be less severe than acute stage.
- Work disability or forced change in occupation common.
- Chronic heel pain often particularly distressing.
- Low-back pain, sacroiliitis, or even overt AS are common sequelae.
- Recurrences of acute syndrome may occur.
- HLA-B27–positive patients showed a worse outcome than B27-negative in most studies.
- Patients with Yersinia- or Salmonella-induced arthritis have less chronic disease than those following epidemic shigellosis.

## LABORATORY AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS

- ESR and acute-phase reactants usually elevated during acute phase, often markedly.
- Mild anemia may be present.
- Synovial fluid is nonspecifically inflammatory.
- In most ethnic groups, 30–50% of patients are B27-positive.
- Triggering infection usually does not persist at primary site through onset of reactive disease.
- May be possible to culture organism (Yersinia, Chlamydia).
- Serologic evidence of exposure is nonspecific and of questionable utility.
- PCR for chlamydial DNA in first-voided urine may have high sensitivity acutely, less useful chronically.
- In early/mild disease, radiographic changes may be absent or confined to juxtaarticular osteoporosis.
- Long-standing disease shares radiographic features with PsA.
- Marginal erosions and loss of joint space in affected joints.
- Periostitis with reactive new bone formation is characteristic, as in all SpAs.
- Spurs at plantar fascia insertion are common.
- Sacroiliitis and spondylitis may be seen as late sequelae.
- Sacroiliitis more commonly asymmetric than in AS.
- Spondylitis can begin anywhere along lumbar spine.
- Syndesmophytes described as nonmarginal, coarse, asymmetric, “comma”-shaped.
- Arising from middle of vertebral body, less common pattern in primary AS.
- Progression to spinal fusion is uncommon.

## DIAGNOSIS

- ReA is a clinical diagnosis.
- No definitively diagnostic laboratory test or radiologic finding.
- Diagnosis should be entertained in any patient with acute inflammatory, asymmetric, additive arthritis or tendinitis.
- Evaluation includes thorough questioning regarding possible triggering events.
- Physical exam attention: joint/tendon distribution, extraarticular involvement (eyes, mucous membranes, skin, nails, genitalia).
- Synovial fluid analysis usually necessary to exclude septic or crystal-induced arthritis.
- Culture, serology, molecular methods may help identify trigger, but not reliable.
- Typing for B27 has low negative predictive value in ReA.
- May have prognostic significance (severity, chronicity, propensity for spondylitis/uveitis).
- If positive, helpful diagnostically in atypical cases.
- HIV testing often indicated, may be necessary for therapy selection.
- ReA and disseminated gonococcal disease can be venereally acquired/associated with urethritis.
- Unlike ReA, gonococcal arthritis/tenosynovitis involve upper/lower extremities equally, spare axial skeleton.
- Gonococcal disease associated with characteristic vesicular skin lesions.
- Positive gonococcal culture from urethra/cervix doesn't exclude ReA.
- Culturing gonococci from blood, skin lesion, or synovium establishes disseminated gonococcal disease.
- PCR for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis may be helpful.
- Occasionally, only a therapeutic antibiotic trial distinguishes ReA from disseminated gonococcal disease.
- ReA shares many features with PsA.
- PsA usually gradual onset, arthritis tends to affect upper extremities primarily.
- Usually no associated mouth ulcers, urethritis, or bowel symptoms in PsA.

## TREATMENT

### Reactive Arthritis

- Most patients benefit from high-dose NSAIDs, though acute symptoms rarely completely ameliorated.
- Some patients fail to respond.
- Prompt antibiotic treatment of acute chlamydial urethritis or enteric infection may prevent ReA, not universally successful.
- Data on antibiotic therapy after arthritis onset are conflicting.
- Systematic review/meta-analysis suggested no benefit.
- One trial reported majority of chronic ReA with C. trachomatis/C. pneumoniae benefited from 6-month rifampin + azithromycin/doxycycline.
- This study awaits confirmation.
- Sulfasalazine (up to 3 g/d) may be beneficial for persistent ReA.
- Patients with persistent disease may respond to azathioprine (1–2 mg/kg/d) or methotrexate (up to 20 mg/week).
- These regimens not formally studied.
- Anecdotal evidence supports anti-TNF use in severe chronic cases.
- Isolated reports of responses to anti-IL-17A or anti-IL-6 receptor therapy.
- Tendinitis/enthesitic lesions may benefit from intralesional glucocorticoids.
- Uveitis may require aggressive treatment to prevent serious sequelae.
- Skin lesions ordinarily require only symptomatic topical treatment.
- HIV patients with ReA (many with severe skin lesions): skin lesions respond to antiretroviral therapy.
- Cardiac complications managed conventionally, neurologic symptoms symptomatically.
- Comprehensive management includes counseling to avoid STDs/enteropathogens.
- Appropriate physical therapy, vocational counseling.
- Continued surveillance for long-term complications (AS).
- History of ReA increases risk for recurrent attacks after repeat exposure.
- Azathioprine, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, pamidronate, anti-TNFα, anti-IL-17A, anti-IL-6 receptor agents were not FDA approved for this purpose at publication time.

# PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS

- Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an **inflammatory musculoskeletal disease** with autoimmune/autoinflammatory features.
- Characteristically occurs in individuals with psoriasis.

## HISTORIC BACKGROUND

- Association between arthritis and psoriasis noted in 19th century.
- 1960s: clear that PsA was usually seronegative (unlike RA).
- Often involved DIP joints, spine, sacroiliac joints.
- Had distinctive radiographic features.
- Showed considerable familial aggregation.
- 1970s: PsA included in broader spondyloarthritis category due to similarities with AS/ReA.

## EPIDEMIOLOGY

- Prevalence appears to be increasing.
- Recent data suggest up to 30% of psoriasis patients develop PsA.
- Longer duration and greater severity of psoriasis increase likelihood of PsA.
- White populations: psoriasis prevalence 1–3%.
- Other races: psoriasis/PsA less common without HIV infection.
- Prevalence of PsA in individuals with psoriasis may be less common in other races.
- First-degree relatives of PsA patients have elevated risk for psoriasis, PsA, other SpA forms.
- Up to 30% of psoriasis patients have an affected first-degree relative.
- Monozygotic twins: concordance 35–72% for psoriasis, 10–30% for PsA.
- Variety of HLA associations found.
- HLA-C6 directly associated with psoriasis, particularly familial juvenile-onset (type I).
- HLA-B27 associated with psoriatic spondylitis.
- HLA-DR7, -DQ3, -B57 associated with PsA due to linkage disequilibrium with C6.
- Recent study found additive associations of PsA with haplotypes containing HLA-B8, -C6, -B27, -B38, -B39.
- Correlation between different haplotype combinations and entheseal, synovial, or axial predominant phenotypes.
- Genome-wide analyses identified associations with polymorphisms in IL-23R, TNIP1, TRAF3IP2, TNFAIP3, TYK2, TNF, IL12A, IL12B.
- Specific IL23R SNP associated with PsA distinct from psoriasis without arthritis.
- Overall genetic sharing of AS with psoriasis is 0.28, lower than with IBD.
- Polymorphisms in IL-23A associated with psoriasis and PsA, but not with AS.

## PATHOLOGY

- Inflamed synovium resembles RA, less hyperplasia/cellularity.
- Synovial vascular pattern generally greater/more tortuous than in RA.
- Some studies indicate higher tendency to synovial fibrosis in PsA.
- Unlike RA, PsA shows prominent **enthesitis**, histology similar to other SpA forms.

## PATHOGENESIS

- PsA presumably shares immunopathogenic mechanisms with psoriasis.
- PsA synovium characterized by lining layer hyperplasia, diffuse infiltration with T cells, B cells, macrophages, NK receptor–expressing cells.
- Upregulation of leukocyte homing receptors.
- Neutrophil proliferation with angiogenesis.
- Clonally expanded T-cell subpopulations frequent in synovium and skin.
- Plasmacytoid dendritic cells thought to play key role in psoriasis, some evidence for participation in PsA.
- Interferon γ, TNF, IL-1β, 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17A, MRP (S100A8/A9) found in PsA synovium/synovial fluid.
- **IL-23/17 pathway cytokines** are critical drivers of PsA pathogenesis.
- TH17 cells and type 3 innate lymphocytes (ILC3) identified in dermal extracts of psoriatic lesions and synovial fluid of PsA patients.
- Consistent with extensive bone remodeling, PsA patients have marked increase in osteoclastic precursors in peripheral blood.
- Upregulation of RANKL in synovial lining layer.
- Increased serum levels of TNF, RANKL, leptin, omentin positively correlate with osteoclastic precursors.

## CLINICAL FEATURES

- In 70% of cases, psoriasis precedes joint disease.
- In 15%, manifestations appear within 1 year.
- In about 15%, arthritis precedes psoriasis, can present diagnostic challenge.
- Frequency almost equal in men/women, but pattern frequency differs.
- Disease can begin in childhood or late life, typically in fourth/fifth decade, average age 37.
- Many classification schemes proposed for arthropathy spectrum.
- Wright and Moll described five patterns: (1) DIP joint arthritis.
- (2) Asymmetric oligoarthritis.
- (3) Symmetric polyarthritis similar to RA.
- (4) Axial involvement (spine/sacroiliac).
- (5) Arthritis mutilans (highly destructive).
- These patterns frequently coexist.
- Pattern that persists chronically often differs from initial presentation.
- Simpler scheme: oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, axial arthritis.
- **Nail changes** occur in most PsA patients, compared to minority without arthritis.
- Pustular psoriasis associated with more severe arthritis.
- **Dactylitis** and **enthesitis** common, help distinguish from other disorders.
- Dactylitis occurs in >30%.
- Enthesitis/tenosynovitis probably present in most, often not appreciated on exam.
- **Shortening of digits** (osteolysis) characteristic of PsA (“telescoping”).
- Greater tendency than in RA for fibrous/bony ankylosis of small joints.
- Rapid ankylosis of one or more PIP joints early is not uncommon.
- Joint involvement tends to follow a “ray” distribution (all joints of one finger).
- Back and neck pain/stiffness common.
- Arthropathy confined to **DIP joints** in ∼5%.
- Accompanying nail changes almost always present.
- DIP joints often affected in other patterns.
- Approx. 30% have **asymmetric oligoarthritis**.
- Commonly involves knee or other large joint with a few small finger/toe joints, often with dactylitis.
- **Symmetric polyarthritis** in about 40% at presentation.
- May be indistinguishable from RA in joints involved, but other PsA features usually present.
- Almost any peripheral joint can be involved.
- **Axial arthritis** without peripheral involvement found in ∼5%.
- May be clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic AS.
- More neck involvement, less thoracolumbar involvement characteristic.
- Nail changes not found in idiopathic AS.
- Small percentage have **arthritis mutilans**.
- Widespread digit shortening (“telescoping”), sometimes coexisting with ankylosis/contractures in other digits.
- Six patterns of nail involvement: pitting, horizontal ridging, onycholysis, yellowish discoloration, dystrophic hyperkeratosis, combinations.
- Extraarticular/extradermal manifestations common.
- Eye involvement (conjunctivitis or uveitis) reported in 7–33%.
- Unlike AS uveitis, PsA uveitis often insidious onset, bilateral, chronic, nonanterior.
- Prevalences of aortic valve insufficiency/heart block apparently similar to AS.
- Widely varying estimates of clinical outcome.
- Severe PsA with arthritis mutilans potentially as crippling/fatal as severe untreated RA.
- Unlike RA, many experience temporary remissions.
- Overall, erosive disease develops in majority.
- Progressive disease with deformity/disability common.
- Some series found mortality significantly increased compared to general population.
- Psoriasis and arthropathy with HIV infection tend to be severe.
- Can occur in low psoriasis prevalence populations.
- Severe enthesitis, dactylitis, rapidly progressive joint destruction seen.
- Axial involvement very rare.
- Condition prevented by or responds well to antiretroviral therapy.

## LABORATORY AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS

- **No laboratory tests diagnostic of PsA**.
- ESR/CRP elevated in only 30%.
- Small percentage may have low titers of rheumatoid factor or ANAs.
- About 10% have anti-CCP antibodies.
- Uric acid may be elevated with extensive psoriasis.
- HLA-B27 found in 50–70% of patients with axial disease.
- HLA-B27 found in ≤20% of patients with only peripheral involvement.
- Peripheral/axial PsA show radiographic features distinguishing from RA/AS.
- **Peripheral PsA radiographic characteristics**: DIP involvement (classic “pencil-in-cup”).
- Marginal erosions with adjacent bony proliferation (“whiskering”).
- Small-joint ankylosis.
- Osteolysis of phalangeal/metacarpal bone, telescoping digits.
- Periostitis and proliferative new bone at enthesitis sites.
- “Ray” distribution of lesions.
- **Axial PsA radiographic characteristics** (differing from idiopathic AS): asymmetric sacroiliitis.
- Less facet joint arthritis.
- Nonmarginal, bulky, “comma”-shaped syndesmophytes.
- Syndesmophytes tend to be fewer, less symmetric, less delicate than AS marginal.
- Fluffy hyperperiostosis on anterior vertebral bodies.
- Severe cervical spine involvement (tendency to atlantoaxial subluxation) but relative sparing of thoracolumbar.
- Paravertebral ossification.
- Ultrasound and MRI readily demonstrate enthesitis/tendon sheath effusions.
- MRI study of 68 PsA patients found sacroiliitis in 35%, unrelated to B27 but correlated with restricted spinal movement.

## DIAGNOSIS

- **Classification criteria (CASPAR)** published in 2006 (Table 362-2).
- Sensitivity and specificity exceed 90%, useful clinical guide for early diagnosis.
- Diagnosis challenging when arthritis precedes psoriasis, psoriasis undiagnosed/obscure, or joint involvement resembles another arthritis.
- High index of suspicion needed in undiagnosed inflammatory arthritis.
- History should include inquiry about psoriasis in patient/family.
- Examine disrobed, seek psoriasiform lesions (scalp, ears, umbilicus, gluteal folds, nails).
- Axial symptoms/signs, dactylitis, enthesitis, ankylosis, joint pattern, characteristic radiographic changes can be helpful.
- Differential diagnosis includes all other arthritis forms, can coexist with psoriasis.
- Differential diagnosis of isolated DIP involvement is short.
- Osteoarthritis (Heberden’s nodes) usually not inflammatory.
- Gout involving >1 DIP joint often involves other sites, may have tophi.
- Rare multicentric reticulohistiocytosis involves other joints, has pearly periungual skin nodules.
- Uncommon inflammatory osteoarthritis lacks nail changes of PsA.
- Radiography helpful in these cases, distinguishes psoriatic spondylitis from idiopathic AS.
- History of trauma to affected joint preceding arthritis may be more frequent in PsA.
- May reflect Koebner phenomenon (psoriatic skin lesions at trauma sites).

## TABLE 362-2 The CASPAR (Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis) Criteria

## TREATMENT

### Psoriatic Arthritis

- Ideally, coordinated therapy for skin and joints.
- Biologic agents dramatically facilitated this.
- First observed with **anti-TNF agents**: prompt, dramatic resolution of arthritis and skin lesions.
- Observed in large, randomized controlled trials of all five agents.
- Many responders had long-standing, resistant disease and extensive skin disease.
- Clinical response often more dramatic than in RA.
- Delay of disease progression demonstrated radiographically.
- Potential additive effect of methotrexate to anti-TNF in PsA remains uncertain.
- Anti-TNF therapy paradoxically reported to trigger exacerbation or de novo psoriasis (typically palmoplantar pustular).
- Therapy can sometimes be continued.
- **Antagonists of IL-23/IL-17 pathway** show efficacy comparable to anti-TNF for PsA.
- In some cases, superior for psoriasis.
- Approved agents: secukinumab/ixekizumab (anti-IL-17A).
- Ustekinumab (anti-IL-23/IL-12p40 subunit).
- Three anti-IL-23 (p19 subunit) approved for plaque psoriasis (guselkumab, risankizumab, tildrakizumab) showed efficacy in PsA trials (Fig. 362-3).
- **Apremilast (oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor)** approved for psoriasis and PsA.
- Not quite as effective as biologics for PsA, but more favorable safety profile.
- Not indicated in patients with radiographically evident joint damage or axial involvement.
- **Oral JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib**, approved for PsA.
- Efficacy comparable to adalimumab (anti-TNF) when directly compared.
- At least five other JAK inhibitors being studied in PsA trials.
- Older treatments based on drugs with efficacy in RA and/or psoriasis.
- Methotrexate (15–25 mg/week) has moderate efficacy for psoriasis.
- Expert opinion favors its use in PsA not requiring biologics.
- Agents with efficacy in psoriasis reported to benefit PsA: cyclosporine, retinoic acid derivatives, PUVA.
- Leflunomide (pyrimidine synthetase inhibitor) shown beneficial in PsA, modest benefit for psoriasis.
- All treatments require careful monitoring.
- Immunosuppressive therapy may be used cautiously in HIV-associated PsA if HIV is well controlled.

# UNDIFFERENTIATED AND JUVENILE SPONDYLOARTHRITIS

- Many patients present with SpA features but lack sufficient findings for preceding diagnoses.
- Formerly termed undifferentiated spondyloarthritis or simply spondyloarthritis by 1991 European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group criteria.
- Some may have ReA with clinically silent triggering infection.
- Others may subsequently develop IBD or psoriasis.
- Undifferentiated SpA commonly applied to patients with peripheral arthritis/enthesitis.
- Also applied to patients with IBP and other SpA features not meeting radiographic criteria for AS.
- Many of latter patients now classified as nr-axSpA (Table 362-1).
- ASAS formulated criteria for **peripheral SpA**.
- Intended to exclude patients with axial symptoms, divide SpA into predominantly axial/peripheral subsets.
- Criteria shown in Table 362-3.

## TABLE 362-3 ASAS Criteria for Peripheral Spondyloarthritis

- In **juvenile SpA**, usually begins 7–16 years.
- Typical presentation: asymmetric, predominantly lower-extremity oligoarthritis and enthesitis without extraarticular features.
- Termed **seronegative enthesitis and arthritis (SEA) syndrome**.
- Male predominance (60–80%).
- Prevalence of B27 is ∼80%.
- Despite absence of axial symptoms, active sacroiliitis by MRI commonly found at diagnosis.
- Many (but not all) develop AS in late adolescence/adulthood.
- Management of peripheral SpA similar to other spondyloarthritides.
- Biologic therapy indicated in severe, persistent cases not responsive to other treatment.
- Current pediatric literature should be consulted for juvenile SpA management.

# IBD-ASSOCIATED ARTHRITIS

- Relationship between arthritis and IBD observed in 1930s.
- Further defined by studies in 1950s/1960s.
- Included in spondyloarthritides concept in 1970s.

## EPIDEMIOLOGY

- Both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) associated with SpA.
- UC/CD estimated prevalence 0.1–0.2%.
- Incidence thought to have increased recently.
- Both axial and peripheral SpA associated with UC/CD.
- Wide variations in estimated association frequencies.
- Recent series: AS diagnosed in 1–10% of IBD patients.
- Peripheral arthritis in 10–50% of IBD patients.
- IBP and enthesitis common.
- Many IBD patients have sacroiliitis on imaging.
- Prevalence of UC/CD in AS patients thought to be 5–10%.
- Meta-analysis found prevalence in nr-axSpA patients to be 6.4%.
- Investigation of unselected SpA patients by ileocolonoscopy: up to two-thirds of AS patients have subclinical intestinal inflammation.
- Subclinical inflammation evident macroscopically or histologically.
- Lesions also found in undifferentiated SpA or ReA (enteric/urogenital).
- Both UC/CD show familial aggregation, more so for CD.
- HLA associations weak/inconsistent.
- HLA-B27 found in up to 70% of IBD+AS patients.
- HLA-B27 found in ≤15% of IBD+peripheral arthritis or IBD alone patients.
- Three alleles of NOD2/CARD15 gene in approx. half of CD patients.
- These alleles not associated with SpA per se.
- > 200 other genes associated with CD, UC, or both.
    
- Many SNPs associated with AS also associated with IBD, almost all same direction of association.
- Overall genetic correlation of AS is 0.49 with CD, 0.47 with UC.

## PATHOLOGY

- Available data for IBD-associated peripheral arthritis suggest synovial histology similar to other SpA forms.
- Association with arthritis does not affect gut histology of UC/CD.
- Subclinical inflammatory lesions in colon/distal ileum associated with SpA classified as acute or chronic.
- Acute resembles acute bacterial enteritis: largely intact architecture, neutrophilic infiltration in lamina propria.
- Chronic resembles CD lesions: distortion of villi/crypts, aphthoid ulceration, mononuclear cell infiltration in lamina propria.

## PATHOGENESIS

- Both IBD and SpA are immune-mediated.
- Shared genetics presumably reflect shared pathogenic mechanisms.
- Specific connection remains obscure.
- Rodent models with immune perturbations manifest both IBD and arthritis.
- Resident innate immune cells and intestinal dysbiosis implicated in both.
- Evidence indicates trafficking of leukocytes between gut and joint.
- Mucosal leukocytes from IBD patients bind avidly to synovial vasculature via adhesion molecules.
- CD163 macrophages prominent in inflammatory lesions of both gut and synovium in spondyloarthritides.

## CLINICAL FEATURES

- AS associated with IBD clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic AS.
- Runs course independent of bowel disease, can precede IBD onset.
- Peripheral arthritis may also begin before overt bowel disease.
- Spectrum of peripheral arthritis: acute self-limited attacks of oligoarthritis (often coincide with IBD relapses).
- More chronic/symmetric polyarticular arthritis (runs independent course).
- Joint involvement patterns similar in UC/CD.
- Erosions and deformities infrequent in IBD-associated peripheral arthritis.
- Isolated destructive hip arthritis rare complication of CD, distinct from osteonecrosis/septic arthritis.
- Dactylitis and enthesopathy occasionally found.
- In addition to ∼20% IBD patients with SpA, comparable percentage have arthralgias or fibromyalgia.
- Other extraintestinal manifestations of IBD: uveitis, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, pulmonary nodules, clubbing.
- Somewhat more common in CD than UC.
- Uveitis shares features described for PsA-associated uveitis.

## LABORATORY AND RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS

- Laboratory findings reflect inflammatory/metabolic manifestations of IBD.
- Joint fluid usually at least mildly inflammatory.
- Of patients with AS and IBD, 30–70% carry HLA-B27.
- Compared to 80–90% of AS alone, 50–70% of AS+psoriasis.
- Definite/probable AS in a B27-negative individual without psoriasis should raise concern for occult IBD.
- Radiographic changes in axial skeleton same as uncomplicated AS.
- Erosions uncommon in peripheral arthritis but may occur, particularly in metatarsophalangeal joints.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Diarrhea and arthritis are common, can coexist for various reasons.
- When etiopathogenically related, ReA and IBD-associated arthritis are most common causes.
- Rare causes: celiac disease, Whipple’s disease.
- Behcet’s disease can mimic CD and cause arthritis.
- In most cases, diagnosis depends on investigation of bowel disease.

## TREATMENT

### IBD-Associated Arthritis

- Treatment of CD improved by **anti-TNF agents**.
- Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol effective for induction/maintenance remission in CD.
- Infliximab effective in fistulizing CD.
- IBD-associated arthritis also responds to these agents.
- Other biologics with efficacy in IBD potentially effective for peripheral arthritis: ustekinumab (anti-IL12/23), risankizumab (anti-IL-23).
- Anti-IL-17 therapy not indicated (Fig. 362-3).
- Tofacitinib approved for UC treatment.
- Other promising JAK inhibitors: upadacitinib, filgotinib.
- Other IBD treatments: sulfasalazine/related drugs, systemic/local glucocorticoids.
- NSAIDs (especially COX-selective) helpful for arthritis, generally well tolerated.
- NSAIDs can precipitate IBD flares.
- Rare cases of IBD apparently precipitated by anti-TNF therapy.
- Vedolizumab (gut-selective integrin inhibitor) approved for CD/UC.
- Not given specifically for joint disease, but coexistent arthritis can improve during IBD treatment.
- Many reports of de novo or flaring arthritis (axial/peripheral) in IBD patients treated with vedolizumab.

# SAPHO SYNDROME

- Syndrome of **synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO)**.
- Characterized by skin and musculoskeletal manifestations.
- Dermatologic manifestations: palmoplantar pustulosis, acne conglobata, acne fulminans, hidradenitis suppurativa.
- Main musculoskeletal findings: sternoclavicular/spinal hyperostosis, chronic recurrent foci of sterile osteomyelitis, axial/peripheral arthritis.
- Cases with one or a few manifestations are probably the rule.
- ESR and/or CRP usually mildly to moderately elevated, occasionally dramatically.
- Bacteria (most often Propionibacterium acnes) cultured from bone biopsy specimens/other sites.
- IBD coexistent in 8% of patients in one large series.
- No gene associations found, despite resemblance to autoinflammatory syndromes.
- Radionuclide bone scan very helpful diagnostically.
- Often shows classic “bull’s head” sign involving sternoclavicular joints/clavicles.
- High-dose NSAIDs may provide relief from bone pain.
- Uncontrolled series/case reports describe successful therapy with pamidronate/other bisphosphonates.
- Anecdotal benefit from biologic agents reported (anti-TNF, anti-IL-17A, anti-IL-12/23, anti-IL-6, anti-IL-1).
- Successful prolonged antibiotic therapy also reported.

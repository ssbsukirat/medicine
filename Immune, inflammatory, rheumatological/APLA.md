# DEFINITIONS

- **Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)** is an autoantibody-mediated acquired thrombophilia.
- It is characterized by recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity.
- APS primarily affects females.
- APS may occur alone (primary) or in association with other autoimmune diseases, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (secondary).
- **Catastrophic APS (CAPS)** is a life-threatening rapidly progressive thromboembolic disease involving simultaneously three or more organs.

# The major autoantibodies detected in patients’ sera are directed against negatively charged phospholipids (PLs) and/or PL-binding plasma proteins...

- Major autoantibodies are directed against negatively charged phospholipids (PLs) and/or PL-binding plasma proteins such as β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) and prothrombin.
- PLs are components of the cytoplasmic membrane of all living cells.
- Antibodies are directed against PLs like cardiolipin, phosphocholine, and phosphatidylserine.
- **β2GPI** is a 43-kDa plasma apolipoprotein with 326 amino acids in five domains (I-V).
- Domain V forms a positively charged patch suitable for interaction with negatively charged PLs.
- In plasma, β2GPI has a circular conformation with domain V binding to and concealing B-cell epitopes on domain I.
- Presence of **anti–domain I IgG antibodies** has been recently associated with increased thrombotic risk.
- Another group of antibodies, termed **lupus anticoagulant (LA)**, prolongs clotting times in vitro, which are not corrected by adding normal plasma.
- Patients with APS often have antibodies recognizing _Treponema pallidum_ PL/cholesterol complexes, detected by VDRL tests.
- These are characterized as biologic false-positive serologic tests for syphilis (BFP-STS).

# the term seronegative APS has been coined.

- Seronegative APS refers to patients presenting with features highly reminiscent of APS but without classical anti-PL antibodies.
- Testing for **antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies** may have a valuable diagnostic role in suspected seronegative APS.

# TABLE 357-1 Classification and Nomenclature of Antiphospholipid Antibodies

- Information related to this classification is present in the text:
    - Lupus anticoagulant (LA) is a type of antiphospholipid antibody.
    - Anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies are a type of antiphospholipid antibody.
    - Anti-β2GPI antibodies are a type of antiphospholipid antibody.

# EPIDEMIOLOGY

- The incidence of APS is estimated to be ∼5 cases per 100,000 persons per year.
- The prevalence of APS in the general population is estimated at 40–50 per 100,000.
- Anti-PL antibodies occur in 1–5% of the general population.
- Their prevalence increases with age; however, their ability to induce thrombotic events in elderly individuals is questionable.
- One-third of patients with SLE and other autoimmune diseases possess these antibodies, but only 5–10% of them develop APS.

# PATHOGENESIS

- Initiating events for inducing antibodies to PL-binding proteins seem to be infections, oxidative stress, and major physical stresses (surgery, trauma).
- An appropriate genetic background, with previously demonstrated associations with alleles within the HLA locus, is also involved.
- These contributors seem to induce increased **apoptosis** of vessel endothelial cells and subsequent exposure of PLs.
- Exposed PLs, bound with serum proteins like β2GPI or prothrombin, lead to **neoantigen formation**, triggering anti-PL induction.
- Binding of anti-PLs to disrupted endothelial cells leads to initiation of intravascular coagulation and thrombus formation.
- Complement and neutrophil activation, and recently, an imbalance between type I and III interferons, have been proposed as potential mechanisms for thrombotic events and APS-related obstetric complications.

# CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND LABORATORY FINDINGS

- Clinical manifestations represent consequences of venous or arterial thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity.
- **Venous thrombosis** occurs primarily in the lower extremities, often leading to pulmonary emboli.
- Thrombosis of pulmonary arteries leads to pulmonary hypertension.
- Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava leads to Budd-Chiari syndrome.
- Cerebral venous thrombosis presents with signs/symptoms of intracranial hypertension and retinal vein thrombosis.
- **Arterial thrombosis** affects more commonly the arteries of the brain, manifested as migraines, cognitive dysfunction, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), stroke, and retinal artery occlusion.
- Arterial thrombosis of extremities presents with ischemic leg ulcers, digital gangrene, and avascular bone necrosis.
- Thrombosis of other arteries leads to myocardial infarction, renal artery stenosis, glomerular lesions, and infarcts of spleen, pancreas, and adrenals.
- **Livedo reticularis** is a mottled reticular vascular pattern (lace-like, purplish discoloration).
- It is probably caused by swelling of venules due to obstruction of capillaries by thrombi.
- Livedo reticularis usually occurs with CNS vascular lesions and aseptic bone necrosis.
- **Libman-Sacks endocarditis** consists of very small vegetations.
- Histologically, these vegetations are organized platelet-fibrin microthrombi surrounded by growing fibroblasts and macrophages.
- **Glomerular involvement** manifests with hypertension, mildly elevated serum creatinine, and proteinuria/hematuria.
- Histologically, acute phase shows thrombotic microangiopathy in glomerular capillaries.
- Chronic phase shows fibrous intima hyperplasia, fibrous/fibrocellular arteriolar occlusions, and focal cortical atrophy.
- **Pregnancy morbidity** manifests with increased risk of recurrent miscarriages, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), preeclampsia, eclampsia, and preterm birth.
- Major causes of these complications are placental infarctions.
- **Premature atherosclerosis** has also been recognized as a feature of APS.
- **Musculoskeletal manifestations** include bone necrosis, arthralgia/arthritis, bone marrow necrosis, muscle infarction, nontraumatic fractures, and osteoporosis.
- **Laboratory findings** associated with APS are Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.

# DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

- Diagnosis of APS should be seriously considered in cases of thrombosis, cerebral vascular accidents in individuals <55 years of age, or pregnancy morbidity.
- Consider diagnosis especially in the presence of livedo reticularis or thrombocytopenia.
- In these cases, anti-PL antibodies should be measured.
- Diagnosis requires the presence of at least one clinical and one laboratory criterion, in the absence of other thrombophilia causes.
- **Clinical criteria**:
    - 1. Vascular thrombosis: One or more clinical episodes of arterial, venous, or small vessel thrombosis in any tissue or organ.
    - 2. Pregnancy morbidity:
        
        - (a) One or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation;
        - (b) One or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before the 34th week of gestation because of eclampsia, severe preeclampsia, or placental insufficiency; or
        - (c) Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation.
- **Laboratory criteria** (at intermediate or high titers on two occasions 12 weeks apart):
    - 1. LA.
    - 2. Anticardiolipin (aCL).
    - 3. Anti-β2GPI antibodies.
- **Differential diagnosis** is based on exclusion of other inherited or acquired causes of thrombophilia, Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
- Livedo reticularis (with or without painful ulceration) may also manifest in disorders affecting the vascular wall (atherosclerosis, polyarteritis nodosa, SLE, cryoglobulinemia, lymphomas) or the vascular lumen (myeloproliferative disorders, hypercholesterolemia, other thrombophilia).

# TREATMENT

- Risk of thrombotic and obstetric events is closely related to the **underlying anti-PL profile**.
- Risk depends on antibody type (IgG high risk vs IgM low risk), number (simultaneous presence of two or three classical autoantibodies denotes a higher risk vs a single antibody), titer (moderate-high vs low), and persistence of positivity.
- Following the first thrombotic event, APS patients should be placed on **vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for life**.
- INR target with VKAs is 2.0–3.0 for unprovoked venous thrombosis.
- INR target for arterial thrombosis is 3.0–4.0 or 2.0–3.0 along with low-dose aspirin (LDA, 75–100 mg daily), depending on the thrombotic/hemorrhagic profile.
- Administration of **direct oral thrombin inhibitors** recently increased the risk of arterial events, especially in patients with triple positivity or previous arterial thrombosis.
- Direct oral thrombin inhibitors could be considered with extreme caution if contraindications to VKAs exist or target INR is not achieved despite adherence.
- In pregnant women with a history of obstetric APS, combination treatment with **LDA and prophylactic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)** is recommended.
- In cases of thrombotic APS in pregnancy, **LDA plus therapeutic LMWH dose** should be administered.
- Recurrent obstetric complications despite standard treatment: increase LMWH dose (prophylactic to therapeutic) or administer oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d) or IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) (400 mg/kg every day for 5 days).
- For asymptomatic individuals or SLE patients with a high-risk anti-PL profile and no history of events/morbidity, **prophylactic treatment with LDA** is recommended.
- In nonpregnant women with a history of APS-related obstetric complications, LDA seems to reduce the risk of a subsequent thrombotic event, independent of underlying SLE.
- Patients with **CAPS** should be treated with combination therapy: **glucocorticoids, heparin, and plasma exchange or IVIG**.
- Appropriate management of triggering events such as infections is also needed for CAPS.
- For refractory CAPS, B-cell depletion (e.g., with rituximab) or complement inhibition (e.g., with eculizumab) therapies are alternative options.

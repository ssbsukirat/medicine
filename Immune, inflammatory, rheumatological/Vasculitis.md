# The Vasculitis Syndromes

## DEFINITION

- **Vasculitis** is a clinicopathologic process characterized by **inflammation of and damage to blood vessels**.
- The vessel lumen is usually compromised, leading to **ischemia of the tissues** supplied by the involved vessel.
- A broad and heterogeneous group of syndromes result from this process, as **any type, size, and location of blood vessel** may be involved.
- Vasculitis can be the **primary** or sole manifestation of a disease, or a **secondary** component of another disease.
- Vasculitis may be confined to a single organ or involve several organ systems simultaneously.

## CLASSIFICATION

- Vasculitic syndromes have great heterogeneity and considerable overlap.
- Table 363-1 lists the major vasculitis syndromes.
- ![[vasculitis.png]]

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Most vasculitic syndromes are assumed to be mediated partly by **immunopathogenic mechanisms** in response to antigenic stimuli.
- Evidence for this hypothesis is mostly indirect and may be epiphenomena.
- It is unknown why some individuals develop vasculitis in response to antigens while others do not.
- **Genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and regulatory mechanisms** associated with immune response likely contribute to the expression of a vasculitic syndrome.
- Prominent hypothesized mechanisms include **immune complex formation, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and pathogenic T lymphocyte responses**.
- Pathogenesis of individual forms of vasculitis is likely complex and varied.

### PATHOGENIC IMMUNE-COMPLEX FORMATION

- Deposition of immune complexes was an early and widely accepted pathogenic mechanism.
- in 
	- IgA vascultis 
	- Lupus vascultis 
	- serum sickness and cutaneous [[Vasculitis]] 
	- HCV related cryoglobulinemic 
	- HBV related vascultis 
- A causal role has not been clearly established in most syndromes.
- Circulating immune complexes do not necessarily result in deposition and vasculitis.
- Many patients with active vasculitis do not have demonstrable circulating or deposited immune complexes.
- The actual antigen in the immune complex is rarely identified in vasculitic syndromes.
- **Hepatitis B antigen** has been identified in immune complexes in a subset of patients with features similar to **polyarteritis nodosa**.
- **Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis** is strongly associated with **hepatitis C virus** infection.
    - Hepatitis C virions and antigen-antibody complexes are identified in cryoprecipitates of these patients.
- Tissue damage mechanisms in immune complex–mediated vasculitis resemble those in serum sickness.
    - Antigen-antibody complexes form in antigen excess and are deposited in vessel walls with increased permeability.
    - Vessel permeability is increased by vasoactive amines (histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes) released from platelets or mast cells via IgE-triggered mechanisms.
    - Complex deposition activates complement components, especially C5a, which attracts neutrophils.
    - Neutrophils infiltrate vessel walls, phagocytose complexes, and release enzymes that damage the wall.
    - In subacute/chronic stages, mononuclear cells infiltrate the wall.
- The common result is compromise of the vessel lumen with ischemic changes in supplied tissues.
- Variables explaining why only certain complexes cause vasculitis and only certain vessels are affected include:
    - Ability of reticuloendothelial system to clear circulating complexes.
    - Size and physicochemical properties of immune complexes.
    - Degree of turbulence of blood flow.
    - Intravascular hydrostatic pressure in different vessels.
    - Preexisting integrity of the vessel endothelium.

### ANTINEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODIES

- ANCA are antibodies against certain proteins in cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils and monocytes.
- ANCA are present in a high percentage of patients with **active granulomatosis with polyangiitis** and **microscopic polyangiitis**.
- ANCA are present in a lower percentage of patients with **eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)**.
- These diseases (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) are collectively grouped as “ANCA-associated vasculitis” because they share ANCA and small-vessel vasculitis.
- These diseases have unique clinical phenotypes and should be viewed as separate entities.
- Two major categories of ANCA based on antibody targets:
    - **Cytoplasmic ANCA (cANCA)**: Diffuse, granular cytoplasmic staining pattern by immunofluorescence.
        - Major antigen: **Proteinase-3** (a 29-kDa neutral serine proteinase in neutrophil azurophilic granules).
        - **> 90% of patients with active granulomatosis with polyangiitis have antibodies to proteinase-3.**
            
    - **Perinuclear ANCA (pANCA)**: More localized perinuclear or nuclear staining pattern.
        - Major target: **Myeloperoxidase**.
        - Other targets producing pANCA pattern: elastase, cathepsin G, lactoferrin, lysozyme, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein.
        - **Only antibodies to myeloperoxidase** have been convincingly associated with vasculitis.
        - Antimyeloperoxidase antibodies reported in variable percentages of patients with **microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), isolated necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.**
        - pANCA pattern not due to antimyeloperoxidase antibodies is associated with nonvasculitic entities (rheumatic/nonrheumatic autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, certain drugs, infections like endocarditis and bacterial airway infections in cystic fibrosis).
- It is unclear why patients develop antibodies to myeloperoxidase or proteinase-3 or their exact role in pathogenesis.
- _In vitro_ observations suggesting ANCA contribution to pathogenesis:
    - Proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase are normally inaccessible in neutrophil/monocyte granules.
    - When primed by TNF-α or IL-1, these proteins translocate to the cell membrane, interacting with extracellular ANCA.
    - Neutrophils then degranulate and produce reactive oxygen species causing tissue damage.
    - ANCA-activated neutrophils can adhere to and kill endothelial cells _in vitro_.
    - ANCA activation of neutrophils/monocytes induces release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-8).
- Adoptive transfer experiments in mice support a direct pathogenic role _in vivo_.
- Clinical and laboratory observations argue against a primary pathogenic role for ANCA:
    - Patients may have active granulomatosis with polyangiitis without ANCA.
    - Absolute antibody titers do not correlate well with disease activity.
    - Patients in remission may have high ANCA levels for years.

### PATHOGENIC T LYMPHOCYTE RESPONSES AND GRANULOMA FORMATION

- Granulomatous vasculitis histology suggests a role for **pathogenic T lymphocyte responses and cell-mediated immune injury**.
- Vascular endothelial cells can express HLA class II molecules after activation by cytokines like IFNγ, allowing interaction with CD4+ T lymphocytes similar to antigen-presenting macrophages.
- Endothelial cells secrete IL-1, potentially activating T lymphocytes and initiating/propagating _in situ_ immune processes in blood vessels.
- IL-1 and TNF-α strongly induce ELAM-1 and VCAM-1, enhancing leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in the vessel wall.

## APPROACH TO THE PATIENT

### General Principles of Diagnosis

- Vasculitis should be considered in any patient with unexplained systemic illness.
- Clinical abnormalities suggesting vasculitis:
	- palpable purpura, 
	- pulmonary infiltrates + microscopic hematuria, 
	- chronic inflammatory sinusitis, 
	- mononeuritis multiplex, 
	- unexplained ischemic events, 
	- glomerulonephritis with multisystem disease.
- Many nonvasculitic diseases can mimic these abnormalities.
- First step: **exclude other diseases that mimic vasculitis** (Table 363-3).
	- ![[vasculitismimic.png]]
- Crucial to exclude infectious diseases, especially if the patient is deteriorating rapidly and empirical immunosuppression is considered.
- After excluding mimics, the workup establishes the diagnosis and categorizes the syndrome (Fig. 363-1).
- This approach is important because some syndromes need aggressive therapy (glucocorticoids, immunosuppressives), while others resolve spontaneously needing only symptomatic treatment.
- **Definitive diagnosis usually made by biopsy of involved tissue**.
- "Blind" biopsies of uninvolved organs have low yield and should be avoided.
- If polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu arteritis, or primary CNS vasculitis are suspected, **arteriogram** of suspected organs should be performed.

### GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT

- Once vasculitis diagnosis is established, decide therapeutic strategy (Fig. 363-1).
- If an offending antigen is recognized, it should be removed where possible.
- If associated with underlying disease (infection, neoplasm, connective tissue disease), treat the underlying disease.
- If primary vasculitic disease, initiate treatment according to syndrome category.
- Use regimens with published efficacy for that disease.
- Weigh risk-versus-benefit ratio of therapy due to substantial toxic side effects.
- **Glucocorticoids and/or other immunosuppressive agents should be instituted immediately** in diseases with irreversible organ dysfunction, high morbidity/mortality rates.
- **Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a prototype severe systemic vasculitis requiring such an approach**.
- Avoid aggressive therapy for manifestations rarely causing irreversible dysfunction, like isolated idiopathic cutaneous vasculitis.
- Glucocorticoids should be initiated in systemic vasculitides not specifically categorized or lacking established standard therapy. Add other immunosuppressives if response is inadequate or remission requires unacceptably toxic glucocorticoid doses.
- Once remission achieved, gradually taper and discontinue glucocorticoids when possible.
- Choice of other immunosuppressive agents based on available data, site/severity of organ involvement, and drug toxicity profile.
- Physicians must be aware of acute and long-term side effects of commonly used agents (Table 363-4).
- Morbidity/mortality can occur from treatment; monitor for and prevent toxicity.
- Address risk of bone loss in patients receiving glucocorticoids.
- Daily cyclophosphamide: take all at once in morning with large fluid intake to reduce bladder injury risk; monitor for bladder cancer indefinitely.
- Maintain WBC count >3000/μL and neutrophil count >1500/μL to reduce life-threatening infections.
- Monitor complete blood count every 1–2 weeks while on cyclophosphamide to prevent cytopenias.
- Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil also associated with bone marrow suppression; monitor CBC every 1–2 weeks for first 1–2 months, then monthly.
- Methotrexate often given with folic acid or folinic acid to lessen toxicity.
- Methotrexate eliminated by kidney; **contraindicated in renal insufficiency** due to increased toxicity risk.
- Assay thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) levels before starting azathioprine to avoid severe cytopenia from inadequate levels.
- Rituximab associated with infusion reactions; lessened by premedication and skilled infusion center administration.
- **Screen all patients for hepatitis B** before using rituximab due to reactivation risk.
- Tocilizumab associated with cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, hyperlipidemia; monitor labs 4–8 weeks after start, then every 3 months.
- **Infection is a significant toxicity** for all vasculitis patients on immunosuppressive therapy.
- _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ and fungal infections can occur even with normal WBC counts, especially with glucocorticoids.
- All patients receiving daily glucocorticoids + another immunosuppressive agent should receive **TMP-SMX or other prophylaxis for _P. jirovecii_ infection**.
- National/regional guidelines exist but each patient is unique.
- Use guidelines and chapter info as a framework for evidence-based approaches, practice flexibility.

# GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS -- small vessel 

## DEFINITION

- Distinct clinicopathologic entity.
- Characterized by **granulomatous vasculitis of upper and lower respiratory tracts** and **glomerulonephritis**.
- Variable disseminated vasculitis of small arteries and veins may occur.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Uncommon: estimated prevalence 3 per 100,000.
- Extremely rare in blacks vs. whites.
- Male-to-female ratio 1:1.
- Can occur at any age; rarely before adolescence.
- Mean age of onset ~40 years; ~15% <19 years.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Histopathologic hallmarks: **necrotizing vasculitis of small arteries and veins** and **granuloma formation**(intravascular or extravascular) (Fig. 363-2).
- Triad --> upper + lower respiratory + renal 
- Lung involvement: typically multiple, bilateral, nodular cavitary infiltrates (Fig. 363-3). Biopsy reveals necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis.
- Upper airway lesions (sinuses, nasopharynx): inflammation, necrosis, granuloma formation, with or without vasculitis.
- Renal involvement (earliest form): focal and segmental glomerulitis evolving into rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis.
- Granuloma formation is rarely seen on renal biopsy.
- Unlike other glomerulonephritis forms, **immune complex deposition is not found** in the renal lesion.
- Virtually any organ can be involved with vasculitis, granuloma, or both.
- Immunopathogenesis is unclear.
- Involvement of upper airways/lungs suggests aberrant cell-mediated immune response to exogenous/endogenous antigen entering/residing in the upper airway.
- Chronic nasal carriage of _Staphylococcus aureus_ associated with higher relapse rate, but no evidence for its role in pathogenesis.
- Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients show increased IFN-γ secretion (not IL-4, IL-5, IL-10).
- TNF-α production from PBMC and CD4+ T cells elevated.
- Monocytes produce increased IL-12.
- Findings indicate unbalanced TH1-type T-cell cytokine pattern.
- High percentage of patients develop ANCA, which may play a role in pathogenesis.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- Upper airways involved in 95%.
- Severe upper respiratory symptoms: paranasal sinus pain/drainage, purulent/bloody nasal discharge (with/without mucosal ulceration) (Table 363-5).
- Nasal septal perforation can lead to saddle nose deformity.
- Serous otitis media due to eustachian tube blockage.
- Subglottic stenosis (~16%): active disease or scarring, may cause severe airway obstruction.
- Pulmonary involvement (85–90%): cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest discomfort. Up to 30% asymptomatic.
- Endobronchial disease (active or scarred) may cause obstruction with atelectasis.
- Eye involvement (52%): mild conjunctivitis to dacryocystitis, episcleritis, scleritis, granulomatous sclerouveitis, ciliary vessel vasculitis, retroorbital mass lesions leading to proptosis.
- Skin lesions (46%): papules, vesicles, palpable purpura, ulcers, subcutaneous nodules; biopsy shows vasculitis, granuloma, or both.
- Cardiac involvement (8%): pericarditis, coronary vasculitis, rarely cardiomyopathy.
- Nervous system manifestations (23%): cranial neuritis, mononeuritis multiplex, rarely cerebral vasculitis and/or granuloma.
- **Renal disease (77%) generally dominates and accounts for most mortality if untreated**.
- Renal disease can smolder as mild glomerulitis (proteinuria, hematuria, RBC casts).
- **Clinically detectable renal functional impairment usually leads to rapidly progressive renal failure** unless treated.
- Nonspecific symptoms/signs (malaise, weakness, arthralgias, anorexia, weight loss) common during active disease.
- Fever may indicate disease activity but more often secondary infection (usually upper airway).
- Characteristic lab findings: elevated ESR and/or CRP, mild anemia and leukocytosis, mild hypergammaglobulinemia (esp. IgA), mildly elevated rheumatoid factor, thrombocytosis.
- ~90% of patients with active disease have **positive antiproteinase-3 ANCA**.
- In absence of active disease, sensitivity drops to ~60–70%.
- Small percentage may have antimyeloperoxidase ANCA.
- Up to 20% may lack ANCA.
- Increased incidence of venous thrombotic events. Heightened awareness needed; routine anticoagulation not recommended.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Established by **necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis on tissue biopsy** in patient with compatible clinical features.
- Pulmonary tissue has highest diagnostic yield, almost invariably showing granulomatous vasculitis.
- Upper airway biopsy shows granulomatous inflammation with necrosis, may not show vasculitis.
- Renal biopsy confirms pauci-immune glomerulonephritis.
- **Specificity of positive antiproteinase-3 ANCA is very high**, especially with active glomerulonephritis.
- ANCA presence viewed as adjunctive; pursue tissue diagnosis if clinical features inconsistent or ANCA absent.
- False-positive ANCA reported in certain infectious and neoplastic diseases.
- Typical presentation provides ready differentiation from other disorders.
- If not all typical features present, differentiate from:
    - Other vasculitides.
    - Antiglomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture’s).
    - Relapsing polychondritis.
    - Tumors of upper airway or lung.
    - Infectious diseases (histoplasmosis, endocarditis, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, rhinoscleroma).
    - Noninfectious granulomatous diseases.
- **Midline destructive diseases** (extreme tissue destruction of midline upper airway, erosion through facial skin) need differentiation. Primary vasculitis not seen in these.
- Upper airway neoplasms, specifically **extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type)** are important causes of midline destructive disease. Diagnosed by histology. Treated based on dissemination; localized lesions respond to irradiation. Upper airway lesions should never be irradiated in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
- **Cocaine-induced tissue injury** can mimic granulomatosis with polyangiitis in isolated midline destructive disease. ANCA targeting human neutrophil elastase found in these patients can complicate differentiation. Levamisole adulteration of cocaine (common) can cause cutaneous infarction and serologic changes mimicking vasculitis. Granulocytopenia common in levamisole-induced disease, not associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
- Differentiate from **lymphomatoid granulomatosis**: Epstein-Barr virus–positive B-cell proliferation with exuberant T-cell reaction. Affects lung, skin, CNS, kidney with atypical lymphocytoid/plasmacytoid cells infiltrating nonlymphoid tissue angi-invasively. Not an inflammatory vasculitis but angiocentric perivascular infiltration of atypical mononuclear cells. Up to 50% may develop malignant lymphoma.

## TREATMENT

### Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis

- Untreated was universally fatal within months.
- Glucocorticoids alone gave symptomatic improvement but little effect on outcome.
- **Cyclophosphamide dramatically changed outcome**: >90% marked improvement, 75% complete remission, >80% 5-year survival.
- Despite successful induction, 50–70% later have one or more relapses.
- Determine relapse based on objective evidence; rule out infection, medication toxicity, chronic sequelae.
- Many in remission have positive ANCA for years; changes in ANCA should not measure disease activity.
- Large study: ANCA increases not associated with relapse; only 43% relapsed within 1 year of ANCA increase.
- Rise in ANCA alone is not a harbinger of immediate relapse and should not prompt reinstitution/increase of immunosuppression.
- Reinduction of remission after relapse is almost always achieved.
- High percentage have some degree of irreversible damage (renal insufficiency, neurologic impairment, hearing loss, subglottic stenosis, saddle nose, chronic sinus dysfunction).
- Patients with irreversible renal failure achieving remission have undergone successful renal transplantation.
- Treatment has two phases: **induction** (remission) and **maintenance**.
- Choice of agents guided by published data, disease severity, patient factors (contraindications, relapse history, comorbidities).
- **Current induction:** glucocorticoids + another immunosuppressive agent.
    - Severe disease: Historically prednisone 1 mg/kg/d for 1st month, then tapered. Reduced-dose glucocorticoid regimen found noninferior and associated with lower serious infection rate in randomized trial.
    - Nonsevere disease: Consider lower initial glucocorticoid doses.
    - Life-threatening disease: Methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days used.
    - Adjunctive plasmapheresis: No added benefit in reducing composite outcome of end-stage renal disease or death in recent trial. Role in selected patients with fulminant disease uncertain.
- **CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE INDUCTION FOR SEVERE DISEASE**:
    - Daily cyclophosphamide + glucocorticoids proven effective for induction/survival.
    - Daily dose: 2 mg/kg/d orally; reduce dose in renal insufficiency (renally eliminated).
    - Daily cyclophosphamide is favored by the authors.
    - Some reports indicate success with IV cyclophosphamide.
    - Randomized trial comparing IV (15 mg/kg * 3 infusions every 2/3 weeks) vs. daily oral cyclophosphamide: IV comparable remission rate with lower cumulative dose/leukopenia, but relapse higher (19% vs 9%).
- **RITUXIMAB INDUCTION FOR SEVERE DISEASE**:
    - Chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20 on B lymphocytes.
    - **FDA approved for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis**.
    - Two randomized trials (ANCA-positive, severe active disease): Rituximab (375 mg/m² weekly for 4 weeks + glucocorticoids) was as effective as cyclophosphamide + glucocorticoids for inducing remission.
    - In trial including relapsing disease, rituximab was statistically superior to cyclophosphamide.
    - Adverse event rate similar in rituximab and cyclophosphamide arms. Rituximab lacks bladder toxicity/infertility concerns of cyclophosphamide.
- Decision between cyclophosphamide and rituximab for induction is individual. Consider: severity, newly diagnosed vs. relapsing, contraindications, patient factors (fertility).
- For rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (creatinine >4.0 mg/dL) or pulmonary hemorrhage needing ventilation: **daily cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids are favored**.
- **REMISSION MAINTENANCE**:
    - If cyclophosphamide used for induction, stop after 3–6 months and switch to maintenance agent.
    - Agents with published experience from randomized trials: **rituximab, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil**.
    - Rituximab (500 mg for 2 doses, then 500 mg every 6 months) showed lower relapse rate vs. azathioprine (2 mg/kg/d).
    - Methotrexate vs. azathioprine maintenance trial: similar toxicity and relapse rates.
    - Methotrexate dose: start ≤15 mg/week orally/subcutaneously, increase by 2.5 mg every 2 weeks up to 20–25 mg/week.
    - Mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg BID) may sustain remission if unable to take/relapse on methotrexate/azathioprine, but higher relapse rate than azathioprine.
    - If rituximab used for induction: randomized trial found rituximab (1000 mg every 4 months) had lower relapse rate vs. azathioprine.
- Optimal duration of maintenance therapy uncertain.
- Glucocorticoids: unclear if prednisone 5 mg/d maintenance has greater risks/benefits than discontinuation after 6–9 months.
- Azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil maintenance usually given for minimum 2 years.
- Risk of relapse higher after stopping maintenance. Decision to continue/taper individualized over 6–12 months.
- Patients with significant organ damage or history of relapse may benefit from longer-term maintenance.
- Rituximab has lower relapse rate, but long-term safety uncertain; decision to continue beyond 2 years weighed individually.
- **REMISSION INDUCTION OF NONSEVERE DISEASE**:
    - Not immediately organ- or life-threatening disease: **methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil + glucocorticoids** for induction/maintenance.
    - Cyclophosphamide is rarely justified for nonsevere disease.
- **OTHER BIOLOGIC AGENTS AND SMALL MOLECULE INHIBITORS**:
    - Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig): favorable results in open-label pilot study of nonsevere relapsing disease; needs further investigation.
    - Etanercept (TNF receptor fusion protein): did not sustain remission adjunctively; **should not be used**.
    - Belimumab (anti-B lymphocyte stimulator): no added benefit as adjunctive maintenance therapy.
    - **Avacopan** (C5a receptor inhibitor): investigated as alternative to glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide or rituximab induction.
        - Randomized trial: at 52 weeks, sustained remission higher with avacopan vs. prednisone, similar serious adverse event rate.
        - Glucocorticoid exposure markedly less with avacopan.
        - Avacopan holds promise for reducing glucocorticoid need in ANCA-associated vasculitis.
- **TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE (TMP-SMX)**:
    - May benefit disease isolated to sinonasal tissues.
    - **Should never be used alone to treat active disease involving other organs**.
    - Study: decreased relapses only in upper airway disease; no difference in major organ relapses.
- **ORGAN-SPECIFIC TREATMENT**:
    - Not all manifestations need/respond to immunosuppression; differentiate active disease from damage.
    - Sinus disease can disrupt mucociliary barrier; patients should use local care (moisturization, humidification).
    - Subglottic stenosis often scars; responds optimally to nonmedical intervention (dilation, glucocorticoid injection).

# MICROSCOPIC POLYANGIITIS -- small and medium 

## DEFINITION

- Term adopted by 1992 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference.
- **Necrotizing vasculitis with few or no immune complexes** affecting **small vessels** (capillaries, venules, arterioles).
- **Glomerulonephritis is very common**.
- **Pulmonary capillaritis often occurs**.
- Absence of granulomatous inflammation differentiates it from granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Estimated incidence 3–5/100,000.
- Mean age of onset ~57 years.
- Males slightly more frequently affected.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Predilection for capillaries and venules, plus small- and medium-sized arteries.
- Immunohistochemical staining shows **paucity of immunoglobulin deposition** in vascular lesions, suggesting immune complex formation not a role.
- Renal lesion is identical to granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
- Like granulomatosis with polyangiitis, highly associated with **ANCA**, which may play a role.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- Shares similar clinical features with granulomatosis with polyangiitis due to predilection for small vessels.
- Onset gradual (fever, weight loss, musculoskeletal pain) or acute.
- **Glomerulonephritis occurs in at least 79%** and can be rapidly progressive to renal failure.
- Hemoptysis may be first symptom of alveolar hemorrhage (occurs in 12%).
- Other manifestations: mononeuritis multiplex, gastrointestinal tract, cutaneous vasculitis.
- **Upper airway disease and pulmonary nodules are not typical**; if present, suggest granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
- Inflammation features: elevated ESR and/or CRP, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis.
- **ANCA present in 75%**; **antimyeloperoxidase antibodies predominant**.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Based on **histologic evidence of vasculitis or pauci-immune glomerulonephritis** in patient with compatible multisystem clinical features.
- Strongly ANCA-associated, but pursue tissue biopsy if clinical picture not compatible.

## TREATMENT

### Microscopic Polyangiitis

- 5-year survival with treatment 74%.
- Disease-related mortality from alveolar hemorrhage or GI, cardiac, renal disease.
- Treatment approach is the **same as for granulomatosis with polyangiitis**.
- Disease relapse observed in at least 34%.
- Treatment for relapses based on site and severity.

# EOSINOPHILIC GRANULOMATOSIS WITH POLYANGIITIS (CHURG-STRAUSS)

## DEFINITION

- Described by Churg and Strauss in 1951.
- Characterized by **asthma, peripheral and tissue eosinophilia, extravascular granuloma formation, and vasculitis** of multiple organ systems.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Uncommon: estimated annual incidence 1–3 per million.
- Can occur at any age except possibly infants.
- Mean age of onset 48 years.
- Female-to-male ratio 1.2:1.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Necrotizing vasculitis involves small- and medium-sized muscular arteries, capillaries, veins, venules.
- Characteristic histopathologic feature: **granuloma** (in tissues or within vessel walls), usually associated with eosinophil infiltration.
- Process can occur in any organ.
- **Lung involvement predominant**; skin, cardiovascular system, kidney, peripheral nervous system, GI tract also commonly involved.
- Precise pathogenesis uncertain.
- Strong association with asthma and clinicopathologic features (eosinophilia, granuloma, vasculitis) point to aberrant immunologic phenomena.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- Often exhibit nonspecific manifestations (fever, malaise, anorexia, weight loss).
- **Pulmonary findings dominate**: severe asthmatic attacks, pulmonary infiltrates.
- **Mononeuritis multiplex**: second most common, up to 72%.
- Allergic rhinitis and sinusitis: up to 61%, often early.
- Clinically recognizable heart disease (myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis, coronary vasculitis): ~14%, **important cause of mortality**.
- Skin lesions (~51%): purpura, cutaneous/subcutaneous nodules.
- Renal disease: less common and generally less severe than in granulomatosis with polyangiitis/microscopic polyangiitis.
- Characteristic laboratory finding: **striking eosinophilia (>1000 cells/μL in >80%)**.
- Evidence of inflammation: elevated ESR and/or CRP, fibrinogen, α2-globulins (81%).
- Other lab findings reflect involved organ systems.
- ~48% have circulating ANCA, usually **antimyeloperoxidase**.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Optimally made by **biopsy** in patient with characteristic clinical manifestations.
- Histologic confirmation can be challenging as pathognomonic features may not occur simultaneously.
- Diagnosis requires evidence of **asthma, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and clinical features consistent with vasculitis**.

## TREATMENT

### Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)

- Prognosis untreated is poor (25% 5-year survival).
- With treatment, prognosis is favorable (72% 78-month actuarial survival).
- **Myocardial involvement most frequent cause of death** (39% mortality).
- Echocardiography recommended in all newly diagnosed patients.
- Glucocorticoids alone appear effective in many patients.
- Dosage tapering often limited by asthma; many need low-dose prednisone for persistent asthma years after recovery.
- **Fulminant multisystem disease (particularly cardiac)**: treatment of choice is **daily cyclophosphamide + prednisone**, followed by azathioprine or methotrexate.
- **Mepolizumab** (anti-IL-5 antibody, 300 mg subcutaneously monthly): more effective than placebo in randomized trial.
- Patients with life-threatening disease were excluded from mepolizumab trial; continue treating with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids.
- Mepolizumab is **FDA approved for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis** and severe eosinophilic asthma. May be beneficial for relapsing/resistant asthma needing glucocorticoids.
- Rituximab: examined in retrospective series, may have role in active/relapsing vasculitis despite conventional agents or intolerance.

# POLYARTERITIS NODOSA

## DEFINITION

- Described by Kussmaul and Maier in 1866.
- Multisystem, **necrotizing vasculitis of small- and medium-sized muscular arteries**.
- Characteristic involvement of **renal and visceral arteries**.
- **Does not involve pulmonary arteries** (bronchial vessels may be involved).
- **Granulomas, significant eosinophilia, and allergic diathesis are not observed**.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Difficult to establish accurate incidence; previous reports included microscopic polyangiitis/related vasculitides.
- As currently defined, very uncommon.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Vascular lesion: necrotizing inflammation of small- and medium-sized muscular arteries.
- Lesions are segmental, tend to involve bifurcations/branchings.
- May spread circumferentially to adjacent veins, but **venule involvement is not seen** (suggests microscopic polyangiitis).
- Acute stage: neutrophils infiltrate all layers of vessel wall/perivascular areas, causing intimal proliferation and wall degeneration.
- Mononuclear cells infiltrate as lesions progress.
- Fibrinoid necrosis ensues, compromising lumen, causing thrombosis, tissue infarction, sometimes hemorrhage.
- Healing leads to collagen deposition, potentially further occluding lumen.
- **Aneurysmal dilations (up to 1 cm) along involved arteries are characteristic**.
- Multiple organ systems involved; findings reflect vessel involvement and ischemia.
- Pulmonary arteries not involved. Bronchial artery involvement uncommon.
- Kidney pathology: **arteritis without glomerulonephritis**. Glomerulosclerosis from hypertension may be seen. Pathologic sequelae of hypertension found elsewhere.
- Polyarteritis nodosa–like vasculitis in patients with **hepatitis B** strongly suggests immunologic phenomena.
    - Circulating immune complexes of hepatitis B antigen/immunoglobulin found.
    - Hepatitis B antigen, IgM, complement demonstrated in vessel walls by immunofluorescence.
- Polyarteritis nodosa–like vasculitis also reported with **hepatitis C**.
- **Hairy cell leukemia** associated with polyarteritis nodosa; pathogenic mechanisms unclear.
- Polyarteritis nodosa–like vasculitis described with **deficiency of adenosine deaminase type 2 (DADA2)**.
    - DADA2 patients usually present in childhood with variable features/vascular pathology responsive to TNF inhibitors.
    - DADA2 differs from usual polyarteritis nodosa treatment; consider in patients with suggestive features, especially early-onset disease.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- **Nonspecific signs and symptoms are hallmarks**: fever, weight loss, malaise (>1/2 cases).
- Vague symptoms (weakness, malaise, headache, abdominal pain, myalgias) can progress rapidly to fulminant illness.
- Specific complaints related to vascular involvement in a particular organ may dominate.
- **Renal involvement most commonly manifests as hypertension, renal insufficiency, or hemorrhage** due to microaneurysms.
- No diagnostic serologic tests.
- Leukocyte count elevated with neutrophil predominance in >75%.
- **Eosinophilia rare**; high levels suggest eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss).
- Anemia of chronic disease may be seen.
- Elevated ESR and/or CRP almost always present.
- Other labs reflect organ involvement.
- Hypergammaglobulinemia may be present.
- **Screen all patients for hepatitis B and C**.
- **ANCA are rarely found**.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Based on demonstration of **characteristic vasculitis findings on biopsy of involved organs**.
- Biopsy of symptomatic organs (nodular skin lesions, painful testes, nerve/muscle) highest diagnostic yield.
- In absence of easily accessible tissue, **arteriographic demonstration of involved vessels** is sufficient.
    - Characteristic findings: aneurysms of small- and medium-sized arteries (renal, hepatic, visceral vasculature).
    - Requires **catheter-directed dye arteriogram** (MRI/CT insufficient resolution).
- Aneurysms not pathognomonic; arteriographic findings may be limited to stenotic segments/vessel obliteration.

## TREATMENT

### Polyarteritis Nodosa

- Prognosis untreated is extremely poor (10–20% 5-year survival).
- Death usually from GI complications (bowel infarcts, perforation) and cardiovascular causes.
- Intractable hypertension compounds dysfunction in kidneys, heart, CNS, leading to late morbidity/mortality.
- **Prednisone + cyclophosphamide significantly improves survival**.
- In less severe cases, glucocorticoids alone have resulted in remission.
- Hepatitis B or C associated polyarteritis nodosa–like vasculitis: **antiviral therapy is important**, used with glucocorticoids/plasma exchange in some series.
- Careful attention to hypertension treatment lessens vascular complications.
- Relapse estimated in 10–20% after successful treatment.

# GIANT CELL ARTERITIS AND POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA

## DEFINITION

- **Giant cell arteritis**: inflammation of **medium- and large-sized arteries**.
    - Characteristically involves branches of carotid artery, particularly temporal artery.
    - Systemic disease, can involve arteries in multiple locations, particularly aorta and main branches.
- Closely associated with **polymyalgia rheumatica**.
    - Characterized by stiffness, aching, pain in muscles of neck, shoulders, lower back, hips, thighs.
    - Most commonly occurs in isolation.
    - Seen in 40–50% of patients with giant cell arteritis.
    - ~10–20% initially presenting with isolated polymyalgia rheumatica later develop giant cell arteritis.
- Strong clinical association and pathophysiologic data suggest giant cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica represent differing clinical spectrums of a single disease.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Giant cell arteritis occurs almost exclusively in individuals aged **>50 years**.
- More common in women than men.
- Rare in blacks.
- Incidence varies geographically (high in Scandinavia, lower in southern Europe).
- Annual incidence in ≥50 years: 6.9 to 32.8 per 100,000.
- Familial aggregation reported; association with HLA-DR4.
- Association with alleles at HLA-DRB1 locus, particularly HLA-DRB1*04 variants, demonstrated.
- Polymyalgia rheumatica annual incidence in ≥50 years in Olmsted County, MN: 58.7 per 100,000.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Temporal artery most frequently involved, but often systemic vasculitis of multiple medium/large arteries (may go undetected).
- Histopathology: **panarteritis with inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrates** within vessel wall with frequent **giant cell formation**.
- Intimal proliferation and fragmentation of internal elastic lamina present.
- Pathophysiologic findings in organs result from ischemia related to involved vessels.
- Experimental data support **antigen-driven disease**.
- Activated T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells play critical role.
- Sequence analysis of T-cell receptor suggests restricted clonal expansion, implying antigen in arterial wall.
- Believed to be initiated in adventitia where CD4+ T cells enter via vasa vasorum, activate, orchestrate macrophage differentiation.
- Recruited T cells produce predominantly IL-2 and IFN-γ; IFNγ suggested to be involved in progression to arteritis.
- Laboratory data: at least two lineages of CD4 T cells (IFNγ-producing TH1 and IL-17-producing TH17) participate in vascular inflammation, possibly with differing glucocorticoid responsiveness.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- Most common clinical characteristic: complex of **fever, anemia, high ESR and/or CRP, and headaches in patient >50 years**.
- Other manifestations: systemic inflammation (malaise, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, sweats, arthralgias), polymyalgia rheumatica, large-vessel disease.
- Cranial artery involvement: **headache** predominant symptom. May be associated with tender, thickened, nodular artery (may pulsate, later occluded).
- Scalp pain, claudication of jaw/tongue may occur.
- **Dreaded complication: ischemic optic neuropathy leading to serious visual symptoms/sudden blindness**(particularly in untreated). Most patients have head/eye complaints before visual loss. Appropriate therapy lessens risk.
- Other cranial ischemic complications: strokes, scalp/tongue infarction.
- Large-vessel disease: up to one-third of patients. Can be primary presentation or emerge later in patients with previous cranial arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica.
- Large-vessel manifestations: subclavian artery stenosis (arm claudication), aortic aneurysms (thoracic>abdominal) with rupture/dissection risks.
- Characteristic lab findings: elevated ESR and/or CRP, normochromic or slightly hypochromic anemia.
- Liver function abnormalities common, particularly increased alkaline phosphatase.
- Increased IgG and complement reported.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Often suggested clinically by complex of fever, anemia, high ESR/CRP with/without polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms in patient >50 years.
- Confirmed by **temporal artery biopsy**. May not be positive in all patients due to patchy findings.
- Increased yield with 3–5 cm biopsy segment and serial sectioning.
- Ultrasonography of temporal artery reported helpful and increasingly used.
- **Therapy should not be delayed pending diagnostic studies**.
- Temporal artery biopsies may show vasculitis even after ~14 days of glucocorticoid therapy.
- Dramatic clinical response to glucocorticoid trial further supports diagnosis.
- Large-vessel disease suggested by symptoms/physical exam (diminished pulses, bruits).
- Confirmed by **vascular imaging** (magnetic resonance or computed tomography arteriography most common).
- PET increasingly investigated; role in diagnosis/monitoring unclear.
- **Isolated polymyalgia rheumatica is a clinical diagnosis**: typical symptoms of stiffness/aching/pain in hip/shoulder girdle muscles, increased ESR/CRP, absence of giant cell arteritis features, prompt response to low-dose prednisone.
- Can be associated with peripheral arthritis mimicking rheumatoid arthritis.
- Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP should be negative.
- If peripheral arthritis worsens, consider seronegative rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory arthropathy.
- Muscle damage enzymes (serum creatine kinase) not elevated.

## TREATMENT

### Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica

- Acute disease mortality uncommon (from cerebrovascular events/MI).
- Risk of late mortality from aortic aneurysm rupture/dissection. Patients 18x more likely to develop thoracic aortic aneurysms.
- Treatment goals in giant cell arteritis: reduce symptoms, **prevent visual loss**.
- Approach for cranial and large-vessel disease is currently the same.
- Giant cell arteritis and associated symptoms responsive to **glucocorticoid therapy**.
- Start with **prednisone 40–60 mg/d for ~1 month, then gradual tapering**.
- If ocular signs/symptoms: consider methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days to protect remaining vision.
- Optimal duration uncertain; most series require treatment for ≥2 years.
- Symptom recurrence during prednisone tapering in 60–85%, requiring dose increase.
- ESR and/or CRP useful indicators of inflammatory activity for monitoring/tapering.
- Minor ESR/CRP increases during tapering don't necessarily reflect exacerbation, especially if symptom-free; tapering can continue cautiously.
- Glucocorticoid toxicity occurs in 35–65%, important morbidity cause.
- **Tocilizumab** (anti-IL-6 receptor): effective in giant cell arteritis in randomized trial; **FDA approved**.
- Recommended dose: 162 mg subcutaneously weekly or every other week + tapering glucocorticoids.
- Decision to use tocilizumab is individual (comorbidities, potential glucocorticoid toxicity, tocilizumab side effects).
- Tocilizumab impacts ESR/CRP, eliminating their use for disease activity assessment.
- Methotrexate as glucocorticoid-sparing agent: conflicting results in trials. May be considered in select patients with glucocorticoid toxicity unable to take/intolerant of tocilizumab.
- Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig): greater efficacy than glucocorticoids alone in small randomized trial.
- Infliximab (anti-TNF): did not provide benefit in randomized trial.
- **Aspirin 81 mg daily** found to reduce cranial ischemic complications. Should be given with glucocorticoids if no contraindications.
- Isolated polymyalgia rheumatica: respond promptly to prednisone, lower starting dose (10–20 mg/d).
- ESR and/or CRP useful for monitoring/tapering in polymyalgia rheumatica.
- Recurrent polymyalgia symptoms develop in majority during prednisone tapering.
- Methotrexate study: reduced prednisone dose by only 1 mg on average, did not decrease side effects.
- Infliximab trial in polymyalgia rheumatica: did not lessen relapse or glucocorticoid requirements.

# TAKAYASU ARTERITIS

## DEFINITION

- Inflammatory and stenotic disease of **medium- and large-sized arteries**.
- Strong predilection for the **aortic arch and its branches**.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Uncommon: estimated annual incidence 1.2–2.6 cases per million.
- Most prevalent in **adolescent girls and young women**.
- More common in Asia, but not racially or geographically restricted.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Involves medium- and large-sized arteries, strong predilection for aortic arch/branches.
- Pulmonary artery may also be involved.
- Most commonly affected arteries by arteriography listed in Table 363-7.
- Major branches of aorta involved much more markedly at their origin.
- Disease is a **panarteritis with inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrates and occasionally giant cells**.
- Marked intimal proliferation, fibrosis, scarring/vascularization of media, disruption/degeneration of elastic lamina.
- Narrowing of lumen with/without thrombosis occurs.
- Vasa vasorum frequently involved.
- Pathologic changes in organs reflect compromise of blood flow.
- Immunopathogenic mechanisms suspected, precise nature uncertain.
- Circulating immune complexes demonstrated but significance unclear.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- Systemic disease with generalized and vascular symptoms.
- Generalized symptoms (malaise, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, anorexia, weight loss) may occur months before vessel involvement.
- Symptoms may merge into those related to vascular compromise/organ ischemia.
- **Pulses commonly absent** in involved vessels, particularly subclavian artery.
- Frequency of arteriographic abnormalities and associated manifestations listed in Table 363-7.
- **Hypertension occurs in 32–93%**, contributes to renal, cardiac, cerebral injury.
- Characteristic lab findings: elevated ESR and/or CRP, mild anemia, elevated immunoglobulin levels.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Strongly suspected in **young woman with decreased/absent peripheral pulses, blood pressure discrepancies, arterial bruits**.
- Confirmed by **characteristic pattern on arteriography**: irregular vessel walls, stenosis, poststenotic dilation, aneurysm formation, occlusion, increased collateral circulation.
- Complete imaging of aorta/branches by **magnetic resonance or computed tomography arteriography** needed.
- Tissue rarely available for diagnosis (large vessels involved), obtained only if vascular surgery needed.
- **IgG4-related disease** is potential cause of aortitis/perivasculitis; histologically differentiated by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4+ plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis.

## TREATMENT

### Takayasu Arteritis

- Long-term outcome varies (0–35% 5-year mortality reported).
- Disease-related mortality: congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular events, MI, aneurysm rupture, renal failure.
- Can be associated with significant morbidity even without life-threatening disease.
- Course variable; spontaneous remissions may occur, but most often chronic and relapsing.
- Glucocorticoid therapy (40–60 mg prednisone/d) alleviates symptoms, but no convincing studies show increased survival.
- **Combination of glucocorticoids for acute symptoms and aggressive surgical/arterioplastic approach to stenosed vessels markedly improved outcome/decreased morbidity**. Lessens risk of stroke, corrects hypertension, improves blood flow.
- Surgical correction of stenosed arteries should be undertaken only when vascular inflammatory process is well controlled with medical therapy, unless urgently required.
- For individuals refractory to or unable to taper glucocorticoids: **methotrexate (up to 25 mg/week) has yielded encouraging results**.
- Anti-TNF therapies: encouraging results from retrospective series, but not studied in randomized trials for efficacy.
- Abatacept: did not demonstrate efficacy beyond glucocorticoids in first randomized trial.
- Tocilizumab: did not reach primary efficacy endpoint in randomized trial. Found secondary benefits; encouraging results in retrospective studies; utility remains an active question.

# IgA VASCULITIS (HENOCH-SCHÖNLEIN)

## DEFINITION

- Small-vessel vasculitis characterized by: **palpable purpura** (most common over buttocks/lower extremities), **arthralgias, gastrointestinal signs/symptoms, and glomerulonephritis**.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Usually seen in **children ages 4–7 years**. Can be seen in infants and adults.
- Not rare; accounted for 5–24 admissions/year at a pediatric hospital in one series.
- Male-to-female ratio 1.5:1.
- Seasonal variation with peak incidence in spring.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Presumptive pathogenic mechanism: **immune-complex deposition**.
- Suggested inciting antigens: upper respiratory infections, drugs, foods, insect bites, immunizations.
- **IgA is antibody class most often seen in immune complexes**, demonstrated in renal biopsies.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- Pediatric patients: **palpable purpura in virtually all**. Most develop polyarthralgias without frank arthritis.
- GI involvement (~70% pediatric): colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea/constipation, passage of blood/mucus per rectum. Bowel intussusception may occur.
- Renal involvement (10–50%): usually mild glomerulonephritis (proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, RBC casts). Usually resolves spontaneously. Rarely, progressive glomerulonephritis.
- Adults: presenting symptoms most often skin and joints. Initial GI complaints less common.
- Some studies find renal disease more frequent/severe in adults, but not consistent finding. Renal course in adults may be more insidious, needs close follow-up.
- Myocardial involvement can occur in adults but rare in children.
- Lab studies: mild leukocytosis, normal platelet count, occasional eosinophilia.
- Serum complement components normal.
- IgA levels elevated in about half of patients.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Based on **clinical signs and symptoms**.
- Skin biopsy useful to confirm leukocytoclastic vasculitis with **IgA and C3 deposition** by immunofluorescence.
- Renal biopsy rarely needed for diagnosis, may provide prognostic information.

## TREATMENT

### IgA Vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein)

- Prognosis is excellent.
- Mortality exceedingly rare; 1–5% of children progress to end-stage renal disease.
- Most patients recover completely; some need no therapy.
- If glucocorticoids needed (prednisone 1 mg/kg/d, tapered): useful for decreasing tissue edema, arthralgias, abdominal discomfort. **Not beneficial for skin or renal disease**. Does not shorten duration or lessen recurrence chance.
- Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis: anecdotally reported benefit from glucocorticoids + another immunosuppressive agent.
- Recurrences reported in 10–40%.

# CRYOGLOBULINEMIC VASCULITIS

## DEFINITION

- Cryoglobulins: cold-precipitable monoclonal or polyclonal immunoglobulins.
- Associated with systemic vasculitis: **palpable purpura, arthralgias, weakness, neuropathy, glomerulonephritis**.
- Most common association: **hepatitis C**.
- Can be associated with underlying disorders: multiple myeloma, lymphoproliferative disorders, connective tissue diseases, infection, liver disease; can be idiopathic.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Incidence not established.
- Estimated 5% of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Skin biopsies: inflammatory infiltrate around/involving blood vessel walls, fibrinoid necrosis, endothelial cell hyperplasia, hemorrhage.
- Deposition of immunoglobulin and complement common.
- Abnormalities of uninvolved skin may be found (basement membrane alterations, deposits in vessel walls).
- **Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis** responsible for 80% of renal lesions.
- Association between hepatitis C and vasculitis supported by: high frequency of documented hepatitis C, presence of HCV RNA/antibodies in serum cryoprecipitates, HCV antigens in skin lesions, effectiveness of antiviral therapy.
- Evidence suggests aberrant immune response to hepatitis C leads to **immune complexes** (HCV antigens, polyclonal IgG, monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor).
- Deposition of these complexes in vessel walls triggers inflammatory cascade.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- Most common manifestations: **cutaneous vasculitis, arthritis, peripheral neuropathy, glomerulonephritis**.
- Renal disease in 10–30%.
- Life-threatening rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or vasculitis of CNS, GI tract, heart occur infrequently.
- Fundamental finding: **circulating cryoprecipitates**.
- **Rheumatoid factor almost always found**; useful clue if cryoglobulins not detected.
- **Hypocomplementemia in 90%**.
- Elevated ESR and/or CRP, anemia frequent.
- **Screen all patients for hepatitis C** (antibodies, RNA).

## TREATMENT

### Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis

- Acute mortality uncommon.
- **Presence of glomerulonephritis is poor prognostic sign**.
- 15% with glomerulonephritis progress to end-stage renal disease.
- 40% later experience fatal cardiovascular disease, infection, or liver failure.
- Majority associated with hepatitis C.
- **Antiviral therapy is first-line** for hepatitis C–associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, given efficacy of current therapies.
- Clinical improvement with antiviral therapy depends on virologic response.
- Patients clearing hepatitis C have objective vasculitis improvement, significant reductions in cryoglobulins, IgM, rheumatoid factor.
- Transient improvement with glucocorticoids, but complete response in only 7%.
- Plasmapheresis and cytotoxic agents used anecdotally; observations not confirmed, carry significant risks.
- Randomized trials with **rituximab** in hepatitis C–associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis show evidence of benefit.
- Rituximab should be considered for active vasculitis, either with antiviral therapy or alone if relapsed, intolerant, or have contraindications to antivirals.

# SINGLE-ORGAN VASCULITIS

- Defined as vasculitis in arteries or veins of any size in a single organ **without features of systemic vasculitis**.
- Examples: isolated aortitis, testicular vasculitis, vasculitis of breast, isolated cutaneous vasculitis, primary CNS vasculitis.
- May be discovered during surgery (e.g., orchiectomy for mass found to be vasculitis).
- Some patients initially diagnosed may later develop systemic manifestations.
- If no evidence of systemic disease and affected organ removed entirely, follow closely without immunosuppressive therapy.
- Medical intervention warranted in primary CNS vasculitis or some isolated cutaneous vasculitis cases.

# IDIOPATHIC CUTANEOUS VASCULITIS

## DEFINITION

- Broadly defined as inflammation of blood vessels of the dermis.
- Also called hypersensitivity vasculitis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis.
- Not one specific disease but a manifestation seen in various settings.
- > 70% occurs as part of primary systemic vasculitis or secondary to inciting agent/underlying disease.
    
- In remaining 30%, occurs **idiopathically**.

## INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

- Most commonly encountered vasculitis in clinical practice.
- Exact incidence of idiopathic cutaneous vasculitis not determined due to association with underlying processes and variable course.

## PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

- Typical histopathologic feature: **vasculitis of small vessels**.
- Postcapillary venules most commonly involved; capillaries and arterioles less frequent.
- Characterized by **leukocytoclasis**: nuclear debris from neutrophils infiltrating around vessels.
- Subacute/chronic stages: mononuclear cells predominate. Eosinophilic infiltration in certain subgroups.
- Erythrocytes extravasate, leading to **palpable purpura**.
- Cutaneous arteritis (involves slightly larger dermal vessels) can also occur.

## CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MANIFESTATIONS

- Hallmark: **predominance of skin involvement**.
- Skin lesions typically palpable purpura. Other manifestations: macules, papules, vesicles, bullae, subcutaneous nodules, ulcers, recurrent/chronic urticaria.
- Skin lesions may be pruritic or painful (burning/stinging).
- Most common locations: lower extremities (ambulatory) or sacral area (bedridden) due to hydrostatic forces.
- Edema may accompany lesions; hyperpigmentation common in recurrent/chronic areas.
- No specific diagnostic lab tests.
- Mild leukocytosis (with/without eosinophilia) characteristic.
- Elevated ESR and/or CRP characteristic.
- Lab studies should aim to rule out underlying disease or systemic vasculitis.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Diagnosis by **demonstration of vasculitis on biopsy**.
- Important diagnostic principle: **search for etiology** (exogenous agent, infection, underlying disease).
- Perform careful physical/laboratory exam to rule out systemic vasculitis.
- Start with least invasive approach, proceed to more invasive only if clinically indicated.

## TREATMENT

### Idiopathic Cutaneous Vasculitis

- If antigenic stimulus recognized, remove it. If microbe, institute antimicrobial therapy.
- If associated with underlying disease, treatment often resolves vasculitis.
- If self-limited, no therapy needed except possibly symptomatic treatment.
- If persistent and no inciting agent/associated disease/systemic vasculitis: decision to treat based on weighing symptoms vs. treatment risk.
- Some cases resolve spontaneously; others remit/relapse.
- Treatment of persistent vasculitis not satisfactory.
- Lack of consistent response usually not life-threatening as disease limited to skin.
- Agents with anecdotal success: dapsone, colchicine, hydroxychloroquine, NSAIDs.
- Glucocorticoids often used: prednisone 1 mg/kg/d, rapid tapering possible (to discontinuation or alternate-day).
- Refractory cases: trial of another immunosuppressive agent indicated.
- Chronic vasculitis isolated to cutaneous venules rarely responds dramatically to any regimen.
- Cytotoxic agents should be used only as last resort in these patients. Methotrexate and azathioprine used anecdotally.
- **Cyclophosphamide should almost never be used** due to potential toxicity, as it is most effective for systemic vasculitides.

# PRIMARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM VASCULITIS

- Uncommon clinicopathologic entity.
- Characterized by **vasculitis restricted to the vessels of the CNS** without other apparent systemic vasculitis.
- Inflammatory process usually mononuclear cell infiltrates with/without granuloma formation.
- Patients may present with headaches, altered mental function, focal neurologic defects. Systemic symptoms generally absent.
- Devastating neurologic abnormalities depending on vessel involvement extent.
- Diagnosis suggested by abnormal MRI brain, abnormal lumbar puncture, and/or characteristic vessel abnormalities on arteriography (Fig. 363-4).
- **Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy of brain parenchyma and leptomeninges**.
- Without brain biopsy, be cautious not to misinterpret arteriographic abnormalities as true primary vasculitis if related to another cause.
- Important differential diagnosis: **reversible cerebral vasoconstrictive syndrome** (typically presents with "thunderclap" headache, arteriographic abnormalities mimicking primary CNS vasculitis that are reversible).
- Other diagnostic considerations: infection, atherosclerosis, emboli, connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, malignancy, drug-associated causes.
- Prognosis of granulomatous primary CNS vasculitis is poor.
- Some reports: glucocorticoid therapy alone or with cyclophosphamide has induced clinical remissions.
- Following remission with cyclophosphamide, switch to azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil (good CNS penetration).

# BEHÇET’S DISEASE

- Characterized by **recurrent oral/genital ulcers, iritis, cutaneous lesions**.
- Underlying process: **leukocytoclastic venulitis**, but vessels of any size/organ can be involved.
- Described in detail in Chap. 364.

# COGAN’S SYNDROME

- Characterized by **interstitial keratitis + vestibuloauditory symptoms**.
- May be associated with systemic vasculitis, particularly aortitis with aortic valve involvement.
- Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment.
- Initiating treatment early after hearing loss onset improves likelihood of favorable outcome.

# KAWASAKI’S DISEASE

- Acute, febrile, **multisystem disease of children**.
- ~80% cases <5 years; peak incidence ≤2 years.
- Characterized by nonsuppurative cervical adenitis; changes in skin/mucous membranes (edema; congested conjunctivae; erythema of oral cavity, lips, palms; desquamation of fingertips).
- Generally benign and self-limited.
- Associated with **coronary artery aneurysms in ~25%**. Overall case-fatality rate 0.5–2.8%.
- Coronary complications usually occur 3–4 weeks into illness, during convalescence.
- Vasculitis of coronary arteries seen in almost all fatal autopsy cases, can cause adult complications.
- Typical intimal proliferation, infiltration of vessel wall with mononuclear cells. Beadlike aneurysms and thromboses seen along artery.
- Other manifestations: pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia/infarction, cardiomegaly.
- Prognosis for uneventful recovery is excellent, apart from fatal complications.
- **High-dose IV γ-globulin + aspirin** effective in reducing coronary artery abnormalities when administered early.
- Surgery may be necessary for giant coronary aneurysms or other complications (thromboendarterectomy, thrombus clearing, aneurysmal reconstruction, coronary artery bypass grafting).
- **Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)** observed with SARS-CoV-2 infection may resemble Kawasaki’s disease.
- MIS-C patients can have atypical features: GI symptoms, myocarditis, neurocognitive symptoms, shock.
- Test any patient suggestive of Kawasaki’s disease for SARS-CoV-2.

# POLYANGIITIS OVERLAP SYNDROMES

- Patients with systemic vasculitis having clinicopathologic features not fitting a specific disease but overlapping different vasculitides.
- Diagnostic/therapeutic considerations and prognosis depend on **sites and severity of active vasculitis**.
- Patients with vasculitis potentially causing irreversible damage to a major organ should be **treated as described under Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**.

# SECONDARY VASCULITIS

## DRUG-INDUCED VASCULITIS

- Usually presents as **palpable purpura** (generalized or limited to lower extremities/dependent areas). Urticarial lesions, ulcers, hemorrhagic blisters may occur.
- Signs/symptoms limited to skin, but systemic vasculitis may result.
- Drugs implicated: allopurinol, thiazides, gold, sulfonamides, phenytoin, penicillin.
- Increasing number of drugs reported to cause **ANCA-associated vasculitis**.
- Best evidence for causality: **hydralazine and propylthiouracil**.
- Clinical manifestations range from cutaneous lesions to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Outside of drug discontinuation, treatment based on vasculitis severity.
- Life-threatening small-vessel vasculitis: initially treat with **glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide** (as for granulomatosis with polyangiitis).
- After clinical improvement, consider more rapid tapering.

## SERUM SICKNESS AND SERUM SICKNESS–LIKE REACTIONS

- Reactions characterized by fever, urticaria, polyarthralgias, lymphadenopathy 7–10 days after primary exposure, 2–4 days after secondary exposure.
- Caused by heterologous protein (classic serum sickness) or nonprotein drug (penicillin, sulfa) (serum sickness–like).
- Most manifestations not due to vasculitis.
- Occasional patients have typical **cutaneous venulitis**, rarely progresses to systemic vasculitis.

## VASCULITIS ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER UNDERLYING DISEASES

- Certain **infections** can directly trigger vasculitis.
    - _Rickettsias_ invade endothelial cells, causing vasculitis.
    - Inflammatory response around vessels in systemic fungal diseases (_histoplasmosis_) may mimic primary vasculitis.
- **Leukocytoclastic vasculitis** (predominantly skin, occasional other organs) may be minor component of many other infections.
    - Subacute bacterial endocarditis, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, others.
- Vasculitis can be associated with certain **malignancies**, particularly lymphoid or reticuloendothelial neoplasms.
    - Cutaneous leukocytoclastic venulitis most common. Widespread systemic vasculitis may occur.
    - **Hairy cell leukemia** association with **polyarteritis nodosa** noted.
- Many **connective tissue diseases** have vasculitis as secondary manifestation.
    - Systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory myositis, relapsing polychondritis, Sjögren’s syndrome.
    - Most common form: small-vessel venulitis isolated to skin.
    - Certain patients may develop fulminant systemic necrotizing vasculitis.
- Secondary vasculitis observed with: ulcerative colitis, congenital complement deficiencies, sarcoidosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, intestinal bypass surgery.

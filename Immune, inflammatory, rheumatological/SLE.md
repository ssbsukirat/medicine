# PATHOGENESIS and ETIOLOGY 
- ![[SLEpatho.png]]
- AUTOIMMUNITY 
	- Activation of **innate** immunity 
		- binding of DNA, RNA, and proteins by **Toll-like receptors in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and monocytes/ macrophages** 
		- ***pDCs*** --> **IFN-alpha --> upregulation of genes** in blood, peripheral blood cells, skin lesion, synovium, kidney --> **"genetic signature"** in 50-80% of active disease patients 
		- Activated **macrophage** --> IL-12 , TNF-α , BLys/BAFF (B cell maturation / survival factor)
		- **Lupus Phagocytic Cells** --> reduced ability to clear immune complex , apoptotic cells & autoantigen-containing (e.g., DNA/RNA/Ro/La and phospholipid) surface blebs
	- Interaction of activated innate immunity 
		- Hyperactivation of B-cells by receptors 
			- Double negative B cells (DN2: CD27–CD11c+T-BET+CXCR5–)
			- Epigenetic changes --> increased open chromatin 
		- B and T lymphocyte subsets have altered metabolism (abnormal mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, and oxidative stress), increased glucose utilization, increased pyruvate production, activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and increased autophagy 
	- Increased IL-17 and reduced IL-2 --> more helper T cells and less regulatory T cells 
 - Tissue Damage 
	 - Deposit of autoantibodies / Immune complexes --> complement activation & cytokine/chemokine release --> other inflammatory cells and processes also take place
	 - Non-immune tissue-fixed cells activated 
		 - basal cells in dermis 
		 - synovial fibroblasts 
		 - renal - mesangial cells , podocytes, tubular epithelium 
		 - endothelial cells 
- Multigenic 
	- Early complement deficit  --> C1q,r,s C2 C4 
	- TREX1 on chr X (DNAase)
	- Around 90 SNPs responsible --> increasing risk with increased number of mutation 
	- Environment and epigenetic modify risk 
	- **most characteristic** increased gene expression pattern of SLE patients - **influence IFN production or function** 
	- hypermethylation of genes 
- Females 
	- permissive for SLE 
	- hormones, Genes on X, epigenetic 
	- females have more antibody response 
	- estrogen containing HRT or OCPs further raise risk 
	- XXY - Klinefelter has higher risk 
- Environment 
	- UV light causes flares 
	- infections and lupus-inducing drugs activate autoreactive T and B cells 
	- EBV trigger SLE in susceptible 
	- Tobacco use 1.5 higher risk 
	- Crystalline silica exposure 
	- pesticide exposure 
## Pathology 
- affected skin 
	- deposition of Ig at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), 
	- injury to basal keratinocytes, 
	- inflammation dominated by T lymphocytes in the DEJ and around blood vessels and dermal appendages
	- expression of IFN-regulated cytokines and chemokines and by IFN-producing pDCs and keratinocytes 
- Renal 
	- pattern and severity of injury are important in diagnosis and in selecting the best therapy 
	- ISN/RPS classification, the addition of “A” for active and “C” for chronic changes 
	- class III and IV disease, as well as class V accompanied by III or IV disease, treated with aggressive immunosuppression if possible because there is a high risk for ESRD if patients are untreated or undertreated
	- do not treat class I, II or irreversible changes -VI 
	- class III or class IV renal histology in the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies, without meeting additional criteria = SLE 
	- ![[SLEnephritis.png]]

## Diagnosis 
- criteria are intended for diagnosis of SLE in subjects included in studies; the authors use them in individual patients for estimating the probability that a disease is SLE 
- SLICC criteria, any combination of four or more well-documented criteria at any time during an individual’s history, with at least one in the clinical and one in the immunologic category, makes it likely that the patient has SLE (specificity 97%, sensitivity 84%) 
- EULAR/ACR criteria, a subject must have a positive ANA (≥1:80 by immunofluorescence) and a score of 10 (specificity 97%, sensitivity 93%) 
- ANAs - repeated negative tests by immunofluorescent methods suggest that the diagnosis is not SLE, unless other autoantibodies are present 
- high titer IgG to dsDNA ans Sm antigen are specific for SLE 
- multiple autoantibodies in an individual without clinical symptoms should not be considered diagnostic for SLE, although such persons are at increased risk.

- ![[SLEdiagnosis.png]]
# Clinical 
- 85% of patients have either continuing active disease (on current treatment) or one or more flares of active disease annually 
- Permanent complete remissions (absence of symptoms with no treatment) occur in <5% 
- treatment target is remission on therapy (no clinical manifestations; abnormal laboratory tests permitted) or induction of low lupus disease activity 
- ![[SLEclinical.png]]
## Musculoskeletal 
- Intermittent polyarthritis  --> mild to disabling 
	- soft tissue swelling in tissues +/- tendons --> m/c in hands, wrists, knees 
	- Joint deformity in 10% and reducible mostly 
- erosions - X-ray uncommon but USG in 10-50% 
	- with erosions may fulfill criteria for both RA and SLE (“**rhupus**”)
- Persistent pain in 1 joint --> knee, shoulder or hip --> consider ***ischemic necrosis of bone*** 
		- a/w SLE 
		- in corticosteroid receiving patients 
- Myositis 
	- muscle weakness, elevated CK , MRI findings ++ 
	- muscle necrosis and inflammation on Biopsy 
	- most have myalgia without myositis 
	- consider steroid/anti-malarial myopathy 
## Cutaneous 
- Acute, subacute, chronic 
- DLE - Discoid Lupus Erythematosus 
	- m/c chronic 
	- roughly circular with slightly raised, scaly, hyperpigmented erythematous rims and depigmented, atrophic centers in which all dermal appendages are permanently destroyed 
	- disfiguring if on face and scalp 
	- 5% of DLE have SLE but 20% of SLE have DLE 
- Acute SLE rash 
	- **photosensitive**, 
	- slightly raised, occasionally scaly erythema 
	- on the face (particularly the cheeks and nose—the “**butterfly**” rash), ears, chin, V region of the neck and chest, upper back, and extensor surfaces of the arms
	- worsening a/w flares 
- Subacute 
	- SCLE 
	- scaly red patches, similar to psoriasis, or circular, flat, red-rimmed (“annular”) lesions
	- photosensitive 
	- Ro (SS-A) + 
- Urticaria 
- Lichen-planus like dermatitis 
- Bullae 
- Panniculitis -- Lupus Profoundus 
- Oral or nasal mucosal ulcerations 
## Renal 
- Nephritis is most serious 
- Nephritis and infections m/c cause of death in SLE in 1st decade of disease 
- Asymptomatic nephritis -- Urinalysis in all patients suspected of SLE 
- Renal biopsy in all SLE patients suspected of nephritis  
- Class III and IV have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria >500mg, 50% have nephrotic
- Lupus DPGN -- 20% have ESRD or death in 10 years 
- 20% of SLE patients with proteinuria (usually nephrotic) have membranous glomerular changes without proliferative changes on renal biopsy -- better outcome than DPGN 
- ongoing disease, with flares requiring re- treatment or increased treatment 
## Neurological 
- asking first whether the symptoms result from SLE or another condition (such as infection in immunosuppressed individuals or side effects of therapies) 
- If symptoms are related to SLE, it should be determined whether they are caused by a diffuse process (requiring immunosuppression) or vascular occlusive disease (requiring anticoagulation) 
- M/c is cognitive dysfunction -- memory and reasoning defects 
- headache common 
	- excruciating in flares 
	- mild like migraine or tension headache 
- Seizure 
	- any type 
	- anti-seizure and immunosuppression both needed 
- Psychosis 
	- maybe dominant manifestation 
	- differentiate from steroid psychosis 
		- first few weeks 
		- >40mg daily doses of prednisone 
		- resolves after stopping 
- Myelopathy -- high dose glucocorticoid and immunosuppression 
## Vascular 
- TIAs, Stroke, MI more in SLE 
- More in antiphospholipid antibody + 
- Focal occlusion -- non-inflammatory or a/w vasculitis 
- Embolisation -- carotid plaque or Libman-Sacks endocarditis 
- Always test for antiphospholipid antibodies 
- Clotting--  long-term anticoagulant 
- MI - Accelerated atherosclerosis 
	- 3x-10x risk overall 
	- Women <49 max risk 
	- Male, older age, HTN, dyslipidemia , Diabetes , dysfunctional proinflammatory high-density lipoproteins, high disease activity, high glucocorticoid dose, and high serum homocysteine and leptin have higher risk 
	- Statins reduce LDL levels 
## Pulmonary 
- m/c is pleuritis +/- effusion 
	- Mild -- respond to NSAIDs 
	- Severe - short glucocorticoid course 
- Pulmonary infiltrates -- active SLE -- similar to infection on XRAY 
- Interstitial Inflammation --> Fibrosis --> life-threatening  (Diffuse Interstitial Pneumonitis)
- Shrinking lung syndrome, Intra-alveolar hemorrhage also life-threatening 
- Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension --> manage as Idiopathic PAH
## Cardiac 
- Pericarditis m/c 
	- response to NSAIDs +
	- Some may have tamponade 
- Myocarditis --> associated with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure
- fibrinous endocarditis of Libman-Sack
	- can lead to valvular insufficiencies, most commonly of the mitral or aortic valves, 
	- or to embolic events
- administer a trial of high-dose steroids along with appropriate supportive therapy for heart failure, arrhythmia, or embolic events
## Hematologic 
- m/c is [[Anemia]] 
	- NCNC M/C -- chronic inflammation & impaired iron utilisation 
	- Hemolysis can be rapid in onset and severe, requiring high-dose glucocorticoid therapy 
- Leucopenia 
	- lymphopenia not granulocytopenia 
	- lymphopenia may sometimes predisposes to infection but no treatment needed 
- Thrombocytopenia 
	- recurrent 
	- if >40000 + no bleeding--> no treatment 
	- 1mg/kg prednisone for 1st few episodes of severe thrombocytopenia 
- Recurring or prolonged hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia, or disease requiring an unacceptably high dose of daily glucocorticoids, should be treated with additional strategies such as rituximab, platelet growth factors, and/or splenectomy
## Gastrointestinal 
- Nausea, sometimes vomiting and diarrhea 
- Diffuse abdominal pain --> by **autoimmune peritonitis  and/or intestinal vasculitis**  
- AST ALT may increase in active SLE 
- improve with steroids 
- Vasculitis involving the intestine can be life- threatening; 
	- perforations, ischemia, bleeding, and sepsis are frequent complications 
	- high dose glucocorticoid 
	- if recurrent --> additional immunosuppression 
## Ocular 
- Sicca , nonspecific conjunctivitis are common 
	- rarely threaten vision 
- Retinal Vasculitis and optic neuritis --> serious, blindness over days to weeks 
- Need aggressive immunosuppression 
# Laboratory 
- to establish or rule out the diagnosis 
- to follow the course of disease and, in particular, to suggest that a flare is occurring or organ damage is developing 
- to identify adverse effects of therapies
## Autoantibodies 
- ![[SLEantibodies.png]]
- ANA
	- most important 
	- positive in >95%, usually at symptom onset --> some may have positive after 1 year --> repeat testing if negative is useful 
	- IFA based more reliable than ELISA or bead assays 
	- ANA-negative lupus --> rare in adults, anti-Ro or anti-DNA + 
- Anti-dsDNA 
	- high-titer IgG 
	- not single stranded DNA 
	- specific for SLE 
	- increases in quantities of anti-dsDNA --> flare, particularly of nephritis or vasculitis, a/w declining levels of C3 or C4 complement
- Anti-Sm 
	- specific 
	- do not correlate to disease activity or manifestation 
- Antiphospholipid Antibodies 
	- not specific 
	- classify as increased risk for venous or arterial clotting, thrombocytopenia , fetal loss 
	- anti-cardiolipin, anti-B2-glycoprotein (ELISA), lupus anticoagulant (Dilute Russell venom aPTT)
	- Antiphospholipid syndrome  
		- >1 clotting episode  and/or repeated fetal loss with 2 positive tests atleast 12 weeks apart 
- Anti-Ro/SS-A 
	- Neonatal lupus, sicca syndrome, SCLE 
	- not for diagnosis 
- C1q antibodies 
	- not specific or sensitive 
	- a/w active lupus nephritis 
## Following Up --> Disease Course
- urinalysis for hematuria and proteinuria
- hemoglobin levels, platelet counts
- serum levels of creatinine or albumin
- anti-DNA and anti-C1q levels 
- C3 levels 
- activated complement products --> level of binding to C4d receptor on RBCs and B cells 
- IFN-inducible gene expression 
- Serum BLyS levels --> B lymphocyte stimulator, also called BAFF
- Urinary TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)
- neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)
- monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)
- 30 mg of prednisone daily for 2 weeks has been shown to prevent flares in patients with rising anti-DNA plus falling complement
# MANAGEMENT 
- aim for **low-level disease activity (LLDAS)** --> mild symptoms on the lowest possible doses of medications
- LLDAS uses SLE Disease Activity Score 2K --> SLEDAI-2K 
	- >3 active disease 
	- arthritis 4 points 
	- rash 2 
	- pleurisy 2
	- proteinuria 4 
	- vascultis 8 
	- Low complement 2
	- leukopenia 1 
- LLDAS 
	- SLEDAI-2K less than or equal to 4 
	- no new activity as compared to previous 
	- physician global assessment  <_ 1 
	- prednisone dose <_ 7.5mg daily 
	- well tolerated daily dose of anti-malarial +/- immunosuppression 
# Conservative Therapy 
- Non life-threatening 
	- fatigue, pain, and autoantibodies indicative of SLE but without major organ involvement, management can be directed to suppression of symptoms
- Analgesic and anti-malarial mainstay --> 
	- especially arthritis arthralgia 
	- increased risk of NSAID induced aseptic meningitis 
	- Elevated serum transaminases 
	- hypertension 
	- renal dysfunction 
	- COX-2 inhibitors increase risk of MI 
- Antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and quinacrine) 
	- often reduce disease symptoms
	- hydroxychloroquine withdrawal may increase number of flares 
	- hydroxychloroquine prolongs survival and reduces tissue damage, renal damage
	- hydroxychloroquine blood level ≥750 ng/mL to optimize responses in active SLE --> reduce dose after response + 
	- Annual ophthalmological examinations as retinal toxicity + 
- quality of life is inadequate despite these conservative measures --> low doses of systemic glucocorticoids may be necessary
- **Belimumab (anti-Baff)** and **anifrolumab (anti-IFN type 1 receptor)** are biologics that are each effective for patients with persistent disease activity and fatigue despite standard therapies
	- robust clinical activity (SLEDAI- 2K score of ≥10), positive anti-DNA, and low serum complement 
- Lupus dermatitis 
	- topical sunscreens 
	- anti-malarials 
	- topical glucocorticoids 
	- and/or tacrolimus
	- if severe or unresponsive, systemic glucocorticoids with or without mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, or belimumab
	- anifrolumab 
# Life-threatening 
- mainstay is systemic glucocorticoids (0.5–1 mg/kg per day PO or 500–1000 mg of methylprednisolone sodium succinate IV daily for 3 days followed by 0.5–1 mg/kg of daily prednisone or equivalent) 
- high doses are recommended for much shorter periods; recent trials of interventions for severe SLE use 4–6 weeks of 0.5–1 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent
- One open trial showed high response rates in patients with lupus nephritis treated with mycophenolate mofetil plus rituximab, without maintenance daily glucocorticoids
- nephritis 
	- Either cyclophosphamide (an alkylating agent) or mycophenolate mofetil (a relatively lymphocyte-specific inhibitor of inosine monophosphatase and therefore of purine synthesis) is an acceptable choice for induction of improvement in severely ill patients
	- azathioprine (a purine analogue and cycle-specific antimetabolite) may be effective but is associated with more flares
	- biopsies show ISN grade III or IV disease, early treatment with combinations of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide reduces progression to ESRD and death 
- Toxicity 
	- mycophenolate mofetil --> diarrhea common
	- high-dose cyclophosphamide --> amenorrhea, leukopenia, and nausea 
		- ovarian failure treated by GnRH agonist Leuprolide IM 3.75 before each monthly dose 
	- similar rates of severe infection and death 
- Cyclophosphamide 
	- whites --> low doses of cyclophosphamide (500 mg every 2 weeks for six total doses, followed by daily azathioprine or mycophenolate maintenance) are as effective as standard high doses
	- African-American or Hispanic patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis with mycophenolate mofetil (2–3 g daily) rather than cyclophosphamide, with the option to switch if no evidence of response is detectable after 2–6 months of treatment 
- Severe disease, poorer prognosis -->
	- cellular or fibrotic crescents in glomeruli with proliferative glomerulonephritis, or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
	- High-dose cyclophosphamide (500–1000 mg/m2 body surface area given monthly IV for 6 months, followed by azathioprine or mycophenolate maintenance) 
- Cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate responses begin 3–16 weeks after treatment is initiated, whereas glucocorticoid responses may begin within 24 h
- improved short-term responses with a combination of calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, voclosporin) plus mycophenolate (MMF) plus glucocorticoids (GC) compared with MMF or cyclophosphamide with GC. 
- Maintenance 
	- MMF, Azathioprine safer than cyclophosphamide 
	- MMF better than Azathioprine in survival 
	- MMF (1.5-2g/day) = Azathioprine (1-2.5mg/kg/day) in flare reduction 
	- Screen patients for TMPT homozygous deficiency before azathioprine  --> increased risk of bone marrow suppression 
- If Membranous and Proliferative features on Biopsy --> treat as proliferative 
	- if only membranous 
		- Only treat if nephrotic range proteinuria 
		- alter

# PATHOGENESIS and ETIOLOGY 
- ![[SLEpatho.png]]
- AUTOIMMUNITY 
	- Activation of **innate** immunity 
		- binding of DNA, RNA, and proteins by **Toll-like receptors in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and monocytes/ macrophages** 
		- ***pDCs*** --> **IFN-alpha --> upregulation of genes** in blood, peripheral blood cells, skin lesion, synovium, kidney --> **"genetic signature"** in 50-80% of active disease patients 
		- Activated **macrophage** --> IL-12 , TNF-α , BLys/BAFF (B cell maturation / survival factor)
		- **Lupus Phagocytic Cells** --> reduced ability to clear immune complex , apoptotic cells & autoantigen-containing (e.g., DNA/RNA/Ro/La and phospholipid) surface blebs
	- Interaction of activated innate immunity 
		- Hyperactivation of B-cells by receptors 
			- Double negative B cells (DN2: CD27–CD11c+T-BET+CXCR5–)
			- Epigenetic changes --> increased open chromatin 
		- B and T lymphocyte subsets have altered metabolism (abnormal mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, and oxidative stress), increased glucose utilization, increased pyruvate production, activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and increased autophagy 
	- Increased IL-17 and reduced IL-2 --> more helper T cells and less regulatory T cells 
 - Tissue Damage 
	 - Deposit of autoantibodies / Immune complexes --> complement activation & cytokine/chemokine release --> other inflammatory cells and processes also take place
	 - Non-immune tissue-fixed cells activated 
		 - basal cells in dermis 
		 - synovial fibroblasts 
		 - renal - mesangial cells , podocytes, tubular epithelium 
		 - endothelial cells 
- Multigenic 
	- Early complement deficit  --> C1q,r,s C2 C4 
	- TREX1 on chr X (DNAase)
	- Around 90 SNPs responsible --> increasing risk with increased number of mutation 
	- Environment and epigenetic modify risk 
	- **most characteristic** increased gene expression pattern of SLE patients - **influence IFN production or function** 
	- hypermethylation of genes 
- Females 
	- permissive for SLE 
	- hormones, Genes on X, epigenetic 
	- females have more antibody response 
	- estrogen containing HRT or OCPs further raise risk 
	- XXY - Klinefelter has higher risk 
- Environment 
	- UV light causes flares 
	- infections and lupus-inducing drugs activate autoreactive T and B cells 
	- EBV trigger SLE in susceptible 
	- Tobacco use 1.5 higher risk 
	- Crystalline silica exposure 
	- pesticide exposure 
## Pathology 
- affected skin 
	- deposition of Ig at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), 
	- injury to basal keratinocytes, 
	- inflammation dominated by T lymphocytes in the DEJ and around blood vessels and dermal appendages
	- expression of IFN-regulated cytokines and chemokines and by IFN-producing pDCs and keratinocytes 
- Renal 
	- pattern and severity of injury are important in diagnosis and in selecting the best therapy 
	- ISN/RPS classification, the addition of “A” for active and “C” for chronic changes 
	- class III and IV disease, as well as class V accompanied by III or IV disease, treated with aggressive immunosuppression if possible because there is a high risk for ESRD if patients are untreated or undertreated
	- do not treat class I, II or irreversible changes -VI 
	- class III or class IV renal histology in the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies, without meeting additional criteria = SLE

# PATHOGENESIS and ETIOLOGY 
- ![[SLEpatho.png]]
- AUTOIMMUNITY 
	- Activation of **innate** immunity 
		- binding of DNA, RNA, and proteins by **Toll-like receptors in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and monocytes/ macrophages** 
		- ***pDCs*** --> **IFN-alpha --> upregulation of genes** in blood, peripheral blood cells, skin lesion, synovium, kidney --> **"genetic signature"** in 50-80% of active disease patients 
		- Activated **macrophage** --> IL-12 , TNF-α , BLys/BAFF (B cell maturation / survival factor)
		- **Lupus Phagocytic Cells** --> reduced ability to clear immune complex , apoptotic cells & autoantigen-containing (e.g., DNA/RNA/Ro/La and phospholipid) surface blebs
	- Interaction of activated innate immunity 
		- Hyperactivation of B-cells by receptors 
			- Double negative B cells (DN2: CD27–CD11c+T-BET+CXCR5–)
			- Epigenetic changes --> increased open chromatin 
		- B and T lymphocyte subsets have altered metabolism (abnormal mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, and oxidative stress), increased glucose utilization, increased pyruvate production, activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and increased autophagy 
	- Increased IL-17 and reduced IL-2 --> more helper T cells and less regulatory T cells 
 - Tissue Damage 
	 - Deposit of autoantibodies / Immune complexes --> complement activation & cytokine/chemokine release --> other inflammatory cells and processes also take place
	 - Non-immune tissue-fixed cells activated 
		 - basal cells in dermis 
		 - synovial fibroblasts 
		 - renal - mesangial cells , podocytes, tubular epithelium 
		 - endothelial cells 
- Multigenic

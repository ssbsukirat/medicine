# PATHOGENESIS and ETIOLOGY 
- ![[SLEpatho.png]]
- AUTOIMMUNITY 
	- Activation of **innate** immunity 
		- binding of DNA, RNA, and proteins by **Toll-like receptors in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and monocytes/ macrophages** 
		- ***pDCs*** --> **IFN-alpha --> upregulation of genes** in blood, peripheral blood cells, skin lesion, synovium, kidney --> **"genetic signature"** in 50-80% of active disease patients 
		- Activated **macrophage** --> IL-12 , TNF-α , BLys/BAFF (B cell maturation / survival factor)
		- **Lupus Phagocytic Cells** --> reduced ability to clear immune complex , apoptotic cells & autoantigen-containing (e.g., DNA/RNA/Ro/La and phospholipid) surface blebs
	- Interaction of activated innate immunity 
		- Hyperactivation of B-cells by receptors 
			- Double negative B cells (DN2: CD27–CD11c+T-BET+CXCR5–)
			- Epigenetic changes --> increased open chromatin 
		- B and T lymphocyte subsets have altered metabolism (abnormal mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, and oxidative stress), increased glucose utilization, increased pyruvate production, activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and increased autophagy 
	- Increased IL-17 and reduced IL-2 --> more helper T cells and less regulatory T cells 
 - Tissue Damage 
	 - Deposit of autoantibodies / Immune complexes --> complement activation & cytokine/chemokine release --> other inflammatory cells and processes also take place
	 - Non-immune tissue-fixed cells activated 
		 - basal cells in dermis 
		 - synovial fibroblasts 
		 - renal - mesangial cells , podocytes, tubular epithelium 
		 - endothelial cells 
- Multigenic 
	- Early complement deficit  --> C1q,r,s C2 C4 
	- TREX1 on chr X (DNAase)
	- Around 90 SNPs responsible --> increasing risk with increased number of mutation 
	- Environment and epigenetic modify risk 
	- **most characteristic** increased gene expression pattern of SLE patients - **influence IFN production or function** 
	- hypermethylation of genes 
- Females 
	- permissive for SLE 
	- hormones, Genes on X, epigenetic 
	- females have more antibody response 
	- estrogen containing HRT or OCPs further raise risk 
	- XXY - Klinefelter has higher risk 
- Environment 
	- UV light causes flares 
	- infections and lupus-inducing drugs activate autoreactive T and B cells 
	- EBV trigger SLE in susceptible 
	- Tobacco use 1.5 higher risk 
	- Crystalline silica exposure 
	- pesticide exposure 
## Pathology 
- affected skin 
	- deposition of Ig at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), 
	- injury to basal keratinocytes, 
	- inflammation dominated by T lymphocytes in the DEJ and around blood vessels and dermal appendages
	- expression of IFN-regulated cytokines and chemokines and by IFN-producing pDCs and keratinocytes 
- Renal 
	- pattern and severity of injury are important in diagnosis and in selecting the best therapy 
	- ISN/RPS classification, the addition of “A” for active and “C” for chronic changes 
	- class III and IV disease, as well as class V accompanied by III or IV disease, treated with aggressive immunosuppression if possible because there is a high risk for ESRD if patients are untreated or undertreated
	- do not treat class I, II or irreversible changes -VI 
	- class III or class IV renal histology in the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies, without meeting additional criteria = SLE

## Diagnosis 
- criteria are intended for diagnosis of SLE in subjects included in studies; the authors use them in individual patients for estimating the probability that a disease is SLE 
- SLICC criteria, any combination of four or more well-documented criteria at any time during an individual’s history, with at least one in the clinical and one in the immunologic category, makes it likely that the patient has SLE (specificity 97%, sensitivity 84%) 
- EULAR/ACR criteria, a subject must have a positive ANA (≥1:80 by immunofluorescence) and a score of 10 (specificity 97%, sensitivity 93%) 
- ANAs - repeated negative tests by immunofluorescent methods suggest that the diagnosis is not SLE, unless other autoantibodies are present 
- high titer IgG to dsDNA ans Sm antigen are specific for SLE 
- multiple autoantibodies in an individual without clinical symptoms should not be considered diagnostic for SLE, although such persons are at increased risk.

# Clinical 
- 85% of patients have either continuing active disease (on current treatment) or one or more flares of active disease annually 
- Permanent complete remissions (absence of symptoms with no treatment) occur in <5% 
- treatment target is remission on therapy (no clinical manifestations; abnormal laboratory tests permitted) or induction of low lupus disease activity 
- ![[SLEclinical.png]]
## Musculoskeletal 
- Intermittent polyarthritis  --> mild to disabling 
	- soft tissue swelling in tissues +/- tendons --> m/c in hands, wrists, knees 
	- Joint deformity in 10% and reducible mostly 
- erosions - X-ray uncommon but USG in 10-50% 
	- with erosions may fulfill criteria for both RA and SLE (“**rhupus**”)
- Persistent pain in 1 joint --> knee, shoulder or hip --> consider ***ischemic necrosis of bone*** 
		- a/w SLE 
		- in corticosteroid receiving patients 
- Myositis 
	- muscle weakness, elevated CK , MRI findings ++ 
	- muscle necrosis and inflammation on Biopsy 
	- most have myalgia without myositis 
	- consider steroid/anti-malarial myopathy 
## Cutaneous 
- Acute, subacute, chronic 
- DLE - Discoid Lupus Erythematosus 
	- m/c chronic 
	- roughly circular with slightly raised, scaly, hyperpigmented erythematous rims and depigmented, atrophic centers in which all dermal appendages are permanently destroyed 
	- disfiguring if on face and scalp 
	- 5% of DLE have SLE but 20% of SLE have DLE 
- Acute SLE rash 
	- **photosensitive**, 
	- slightly raised, occasionally scaly erythema 
	- on the face (particularly the cheeks and nose—the “**butterfly**” rash), ears, chin, V region of the neck and chest, upper back, and extensor surfaces of the arms
	- worsening a/w flares 
- Subacute 
	- SCLE 
	- scaly red patches, similar to psoriasis, or circular, flat, red-rimmed (“annular”) lesions
	- photosensitive 
	- Ro (SS-A) + 
- Urticaria 
- Lichen-planus like dermatitis 
- Bullae 
- Panniculitis -- Lupus Profoundus 
- Oral or nasal mucosal ulcerations 
## Renal 
- Nephritis is most serious 
- Nephritis and infections m/c cause of death in SLE in 1st decade of disease 
- Asymptomatic nephritis -- Urinalysis in all patients suspected of SLE 
- Renal biopsy in all SLE patients suspected of nephritis  
- Class III and IV have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria >500mg, 50% have nephrotic
- Lupus DPGN -- 20% have ESRD or death in 10 years 
- 20% of SLE patients with proteinuria (usually nephrotic) have membranous glomerular changes without proliferative changes on renal biopsy -- better outcome than DPGN 
- ongoing disease, with flares requiring re- treatment or increased treatment 
## Neurological 
- asking first whether the symptoms result from SLE or another condition (such as infection in immunosuppressed individuals or side effects of therapies) 
- If symptoms are related to SLE, it should be determined whether they are caused by a diffuse process (requiring immunosuppression) or vascular occlusive disease (requiring anticoagulation) 
- M/c is cognitive dysfunction -- memory and reasoning defects 
- headache common 
	- excruciating in flares 
	- mild like migraine or tension headache 
- Seizure 
	- any type 
	- anti-seizure and immunosuppression both needed 
- Psychosis 
	- maybe dominant manifestation 
	- differentiate from steroid psychosis 
		- first few weeks 
		- >40mg daily doses of prednisone 
		- resolves after stopping 
- Myelopathy -- high dose glucocorticoid and immunosuppression 
## Vascular 
- TIAs, Stroke, MI more in SLE 
- More in antiphospholipid antibody + 
- Focal occlusion -- non-inflammatory or a/w vasculitis 
- Embolisation -- carotid plaque or Libman-Sacks endocarditis 
- Always test for antiphospholipid antibodies 
- Clotting--  long-term anticoagulant 
- MI - Accelerated atherosclerosis 
	- 3x-10x risk overall 
	- Women <49 max risk 
	- Male, older age, HTN, dyslipidemia , Diabetes , dysfunctional proinflammatory high-density lipoproteins, high disease activity, high glucocorticoid dose, and high serum homocysteine and leptin have higher risk 
	- Statins reduce LDL levels 
## Pulmonary 
- m/c is pleuritis +/- effusion 
	- Mild -- respond to NSAIDs 
	- Severe - short glucocorticoid course 
- Pulmonary infiltrates -- active SLE -- similar to infection on XRAY 
- Interstitial Inflammation --> Fibrosis --> life-threatening  (Diffuse Interstitial Pneumonitis)
- Shrinking lung syndrome, Intra-alveolar hemorrhage also life-threatening 
- Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension --> manage as Idiopathic PAH
## Cardiac 
- Pericarditis m/c 
	- response to NSAIDs +
	- Some may have tamponade 
- Myocarditis --> associated with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure
- fibrinous endocarditis of Libman-Sack
	- can lead to valvular insufficiencies, most commonly of the mitral or aortic valves, 
	- or to embolic events
- administer a trial of high-dose steroids along with appropriate supportive therapy for heart failure, arrhythmia, or embolic events
## Hematologic 
- m/c is [[Anemia]] 
	- NCNC M/C -- chronic inflammation & impaired iron utilisation 
	- Hemolysis can be rapid in onset and severe, requiring high-dose glucocorticoid therapy 
- Leucopenia 
	-

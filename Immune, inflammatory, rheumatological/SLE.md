# PATHOGENESIS and ETIOLOGY 
- ![[SLEpatho.png]]
- AUTOIMMUNITY 
	- Activation of **innate** immunity 
		- binding of DNA, RNA, and proteins by **Toll-like receptors in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and monocytes/ macrophages** 
		- ***pDCs*** --> **IFN-alpha --> upregulation of genes** in blood, peripheral blood cells, skin lesion, synovium, kidney --> **"genetic signature"** in 50-80% of active disease patients 
		- Activated **macrophage** --> IL-12 , TNF-Î± , BLys/BAFF (B cell maturation / survival factor)
		- **Lupus Phagocytic Cells** --> reduced ability to clear immune complex , apoptotic cells & autoantigen-containing (e.g., DNA/RNA/Ro/La and phospholipid) surface blebs

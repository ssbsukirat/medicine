# PATHOGENESIS and ETIOLOGY 
- ![[SLEpatho.png]]
- AUTOIMMUNITY 
	- Activation of **innate** immunity 
		- binding of DNA, RNA, and proteins by **Toll-like receptors in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and monocytes/ macrophages** 
		- ***pDCs*** --> **IFN-alpha --> upregulation of genes** in blood, peripheral blood cells, skin lesion, synovium, kidney --> **"genetic signature"** in 50-80% of active disease patients 
		- Activated **macrophage** --> IL-12 , TNF-α , BLys/BAFF (B cell maturation / survival factor)
		- **Lupus Phagocytic Cells** --> reduced ability to clear immune complex , apoptotic cells & autoantigen-containing (e.g., DNA/RNA/Ro/La and phospholipid) surface blebs
	- Interaction of activated innate immunity 
		- Hyperactivation of B-cells by receptors 
			- Double negative B cells (DN2: CD27–CD11c+T-BET+CXCR5–)
			- Epigenetic changes --> increased open chromatin 
		- B and T lymphocyte subsets have altered metabolism (abnormal mitochondrial electron transport, membrane potential, and oxidative stress), increased glucose utilization, increased pyruvate production, activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and increased autophagy 
	- Increased IL-17 and reduced IL-2 --> more helper T cells and less regulatory T cells 
 - Tissue Damage 
	 - Deposit of autoantibodies / Immune complexes --> complement activation & cytokine/chemokine release --> other inflammatory cells and processes also take place
	 - Non-immune tissue-fixed cells activated 
		 - basal cells in dermis 
		 - synovial fibroblasts 
		 - renal - mesangial cells , podocytes, tubular epithelium 
		 - endothelial cells 
- Multigenic 
	- Early complement deficit  --> C1q,r,s C2 C4 
	- TREX1 on chr X (DNAase)
	- Around 90 SNPs responsible --> increasing risk with increased number of mutation 
	- Environment and epigenetic modify risk 
	- **most characteristic** increased gene expression pattern of SLE patients - **influence IFN production or function** 
	- hypermethylation of genes 
- Females 
	- permissive for SLE 
	- hormones, Genes on X, epigenetic 
	- females have more antibody response 
	- estrogen containing HRT or OCPs further raise risk 
	- XXY - Klinefelter has higher risk 
- Environment 
	- UV light causes flares 
	- infections and lupus-inducing drugs activate autoreactive T and B cells 
	- EBV trigger SLE in susceptible 
	- Tobacco use 1.5 higher risk 
	- Crystalline silica exposure 
	- pesticide exposure 
## Pathology 
- affected skin 
	- deposition of Ig at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), 
	- injury to basal keratinocytes, 
	- inflammation dominated by T lymphocytes in the DEJ and around blood vessels and dermal appendages
	- expression of IFN-regulated cytokines and chemokines and by IFN-producing pDCs and keratinocytes 
- Renal 
	- pattern and severity of injury are important in diagnosis and in selecting the best therapy 
	- ISN/RPS classification, the addition of “A” for active and “C” for chronic changes 
	- class III and IV disease, as well as class V accompanied by III or IV disease, treated with aggressive immunosuppression if possible because there is a high risk for ESRD if patients are untreated or undertreated
	- do not treat class I, II or irreversible changes -VI 
	- class III or class IV renal histology in the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies, without meeting additional criteria = SLE

## Diagnosis 
- criteria are intended for diagnosis of SLE in subjects included in studies; the authors use them in individual patients for estimating the probability that a disease is SLE 
- SLICC criteria, any combination of four or more well-documented criteria at any time during an individual’s history, with at least one in the clinical and one in the immunologic category, makes it likely that the patient has SLE (specificity 97%, sensitivity 84%) 
- EULAR/ACR criteria, a subject must have a positive ANA (≥1:80 by immunofluorescence) and a score of 10 (specificity 97%, sensitivity 93%) 
- ANAs - repeated negative tests by immunofluorescent methods suggest that the diagnosis is not SLE, unless other autoantibodies are present 
- high titer IgG to dsDNA ans Sm antigen are specific for SLE 
- multiple autoantibodies in an individual without clinical symptoms should not be considered diagnostic for SLE, although such persons are at increased risk.

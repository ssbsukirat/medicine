# Gout 
## Pathogenesis 
- ***hyperuricemic*** metabolic condition, 
- typically manifested by ***episodic inflammatory arthritis*** with disabling pain
- among middle-aged to elderly men and postmenopausal women
- increase in body pool of Urate (due to hyperuricemia )
	- super-saturation and crystal formation and deposition of MSU in joints and connective tissue 
- Untreated may progress to chronic gouty arthritis , low-grade persistent synovitis and erosive deformities due to deposition of MSU crystals 
- Humans only mammals to have gout due to ***loss of uricase (converts urate to allantoin)*** 
- chronic hyperuricemia prerequisite but other factors
	- ![[Goutfactors.PNG]]
- Uric acid exists as urate at physiological pH as it is weak acid (pKa 5.8) 
- Hyperuricemia
	- Insulin resistance syndrome part 
	- Associated with multiple comorbidities
		- Obesity
		- Hypertension
		- Type 2 DM 
		- Myocardial infarct
		- Stroke 
		- Urate nephrolithiasis
	- Modifiable risk factors
		- Obesity
		- Western diet

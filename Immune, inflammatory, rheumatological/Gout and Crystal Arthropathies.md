# Gout 
## Pathogenesis 
- ***hyperuricemic*** metabolic condition, 
- typically manifested by ***episodic inflammatory arthritis*** with disabling pain
- among middle-aged to elderly men and postmenopausal women
- increase in body pool of Urate (due to hyperuricemia )
	- super-saturation and crystal formation and deposition of MSU in joints and connective tissue 
- Untreated may progress to chronic gouty arthritis , low-grade persistent synovitis and erosive deformities due to deposition of MSU crystals 
- Humans only mammals to have gout due to ***loss of uricase (converts urate to allantoin)*** 
- chronic hyperuricemia prerequisite but other factors
	- ![[Goutfactors.PNG]]
- Uric acid exists as urate at physiological pH as it is weak acid (pKa 5.8) 
- Hyperuricemia
	- Insulin resistance syndrome part 
	- Associated with multiple comorbidities
		- Obesity
		- Hypertension
		- Type 2 DM 
		- Myocardial infarct
		- Stroke 
		- Urate nephrolithiasis
	- Modifiable risk factors
		- Obesity
		- Western diet 
		- Alcohol
		- Sedentary lifestyle
		- **Dieuretics** 
## Clinical manifestation
- Acute recurrent gout flares 
- Usually one joint is affected, oligo and polyarticular flares may happen over time 
- MTP of 1st toe in 70-90% (podagra)
- Others
	- Tarsal joint
	- Ankle 
	- Knees 
	- Finger wrist elbow in elderly or advance disease
- Flares
	- At night to early morning
	- Most painful condition
	- Affected joint rapidly becomes warm tender and swollen
	- Appearance mimics cellulitis (***pseduocellulitis*** ) 
	- Spontaneous subsides 
	- May have variable interval of no symptoms in between (***intercritical gout***)
	- Trigger
		- Purine rich foods 
		- Alcohol
		- Diuretic use 
		- Initial urate lowering therapy
		- Local Trauma 
		- CHF, respiratory hypoxic conditions
- Chronic gouty arthritis
	- After years of flares without treatment
	- Ongoing synovitis, subcutaneous tophi, deformity and bony destruction 
	- Maybe the only manifestation rarely
	- May have only tophi very rarely
- Women 
	- 5-20% of all gout patients
	- postmenopausal and elderly
	- Have osteoarthritis, hypertension or mild renal insufficiency
	- Usually receiving Diuretic 
	- Premenopausal rare but precocious gout in young women has been described caused by decreased urate clearance and renal insufficiency
## Diagnosis
- Labs 
	- Confirm with needle aspiration 
		- as mimicry by 
			- Acute septic arthritis
			- Crystal associated arthropathy
			- Palindromic rheumatism 
			- Psoriatic arthritis
		- Needle shaped MSU crystals typically in acute gout both intracellular and extracellular 
		- Bright negative bifringence on compressed polarised light 
		- Cloudy synovial fluid due to leucocytes (5000-75000) 
		- Large number of crystal means thick, pasty, chalky joint fluid or drainage
		- Always stain and culture for septic arthritis as infection may coexist
		- MSU maybe demonstrated in 1st MTP and knee between flares also 
	- Serum urate levels maybe low or normal at time of flares due to uricosuric property of IL-6 lowering it by 2mg 
	- Always check historic or postflare urate levels 
- Radiology
	- Plain
		- Cystic changes 
		- Well defined erosion with sclerotic change and overhanging bony edges 
		- Soft tissue masses  
		- Absent in early stages 
	- Musculoskeletal USG
		- Early diagnosis
		- Double contour sign over the articular cartilage (MSU deposit)
	- Dual energy CT
		- 2 different energy beams 
		- Identify MSU based in chemical process
## Treatment
- Acute 
	- NSAIDs, colchicine, Glucocorticoids mainstay 
	- Depends on comorbidities, other drugs and response 
	- Early initiation of anti-inflammatory reduces severity of flares 
	- NSAIDs
		- Most common if no underlying comorbidities
		- Full anti-inflammatory doses 
			- Indomethacin 25-50 TID 
			- naproxen 500 BD 
			- Ibuprofen 800 TID 
			- celecoxib 800 followed by 400 mg 12 hour later then 400 BD 
	- Oral colchicine
		- Effective particularly in early flare 
		- Low dose regimen
			- 1.2mg stat followed by 0.6mg in 1 hour then next day dose according to response
			- Better tolerated and same effect as high dose 
		- P-glycoprotein (MDR 1) eliminate via liver , small intestine and kidney and enteric and Hepatic cytochrome CYP3A4 
		- Reduce dose in renal disease or other CYP3A4 inhibitors like clarithromycin or tacrolimus 
		- Caution in hepatorenal impairment
	- Glucocorticoids
		- IM injection 
		- Oral Prednisone (30-50mg/day) followed by tapering with resolution
		- In single or fee joint, Intraarticular injection useful 
		- Anakinra (IL-1Beta and inflammasome role ) 
- Urate lowering therapy
	- Ultimate control of gout 
	- Subsaturation point (<5-6mg/dl) prevent flare and reduces tophi 
	- Required for life 
	- Consider if cannot be corrected by risk factor management
		- Body weight
		- Healthy diet 
		- limiting alcohol use 
		- Reduce fructose rich fruit and beverage
		- Avoid loop and thiazides 
	- Decide on basis of number of flares, severity and duration of flares, quality of life and willingness to commit lifelong
	- Initiate in all patients with subcutaneous tophi, chronic gouty arthritis or uric acid stones 
	- Allopurinol
		- Xanthine oxidase inhibitor 
		- Single morning dose 100mg titrated upto 800mg Daily
		- Target uric acid <5-6 mg 
		- Lower dose in CKD with clearance (30-45 start with 50mg ) and slower titration
		- Lower dose and uptitration reduces SCARs risk (Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions) and flare due to rapid fall
			- Steven Johnson's syndrome
			- Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis 
		- Risk factors for SCARs
			- CKD
			- High initial dose 
			- HLA B5801 
			- Older age 
			- Female sex 
	- Febuxostat 
		- Newer xanthine oxidase inhibitor
		- Predominant glucoronide and oxidative metabolism in liver 
		- No modification in moderate to severe CKD
	- Uricosuric (probenacid)
		- second line
		- Use in good renal function with allopurinol or febuxostat or as monotherapy  
		- Start at 250 BD and increase to 3g/day 
		- Probenecid not useful if creatinine >2mg/dL 
		- ***Benzbromarone*** 
			- More effective in CKD 
	- Other drugs used for other treatments
		- Avoid loop or thiazide Diuretic
		- Losartan, Amlodipine, fenofibrate and SGLT2 inhibitors 
	- Pegloticase 
		- Pegylated uricase 
		- For patients failing full dose of other treatments
	- Avoid in acute flares as it may worsen 
	- Give in resolution phase or after flare with anti-inflammatory prophylaxis 
	- Paradoxical flares
		- Initiation with urate lowering therapy
		- Due to inflammatory response to MSU shedding from  tophi (organised synovial MSU deposit) 
		- Prophylaxis antiinflammatory reduces 
		- Give prophylaxis till patient is normouricemic and without attack for 3-6 months or tophi disappear

# Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease
- CPPD predominantly affect elderly 
- Doubling prevalence with each decade >60years age (>50% in 85 year)
- Most asymptomatic with unclear etiology 
- Pathophysiology
	- ***Increased levels of inorganic pyrophosphate*** in cartilage matrix central to Pathogenesis 
	- Pyrophosphate combine with calcium to form CPP crystal in cartilage matrix vesicles or Collagen fibres 
	- Inorganic pyrophosphate from extracellular ATP breakdown 
	- ANKH gene mutation (responsible for regulating ATP efflux) increase elaboration and extracellular transport of pyrophosphate 
	- Higher activity of ATP pyrophosphohydrolase and 5-neuclotidase which catalyse ATP to adenosine and Pyrophosphate 
	- Lower cartilage glycosaminoglycans and higher transglutaminases enzyme also contribute
	- Release of CPP crystal in joint is followed by ingestion by macrophages and neutrophil, release of inflammatory mediators and inflammasome activation
	- Consider hereditary cause of age <50 
	- Endocrine metabolic condition associated are 
		- Hyperparathyroidism
		- Hemochromatosis
		- Hypophosphatasia 
		- Hypomagnesemia

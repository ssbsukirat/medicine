# Gout 
## Pathogenesis 
- ***hyperuricemic*** metabolic condition, 
- typically manifested by ***episodic inflammatory arthritis*** with disabling pain
- among middle-aged to elderly men and postmenopausal women
- increase in body pool of Urate (due to hyperuricemia )
	- super-saturation and crystal formation and deposition of MSU in joints and connective tissue 
- Untreated may progress to chronic gouty arthritis , low-grade persistent synovitis and erosive deformities due to deposition of MSU crystals 
- Humans only mammals to have gout due to ***loss of uricase (converts urate to allantoin)*** 
- chronic hyperuricemia prerequisite but other factors
	- ![[Goutfactors.PNG]]
- Uric acid exists as urate at physiological pH as it is weak acid (pKa 5.8) 
- Hyperuricemia
	- Insulin resistance syndrome part 
	- Associated with multiple comorbidities
		- Obesity
		- Hypertension
		- Type 2 DM 
		- Myocardial infarct
		- Stroke 
		- Urate nephrolithiasis
	- Modifiable risk factors
		- Obesity
		- Western diet 
		- Alcohol
		- Sedentary lifestyle
		- **Dieuretics** 
## Clinical manifestation
- Acute recurrent gout flares 
- Usually one joint is affected, oligo and polyarticular flares may happen over time 
- MTP of 1st toe in 70-90% (podagra)
- Others
	- Tarsal joint
	- Ankle 
	- Knees 
	- Finger wrist elbow in elderly or advance disease
- Flares
	- At night to early morning
	- Most painful condition
	- Affected joint rapidly becomes warm tender and swollen
	- Appearance mimics cellulitis (***pseduocellulitis*** ) 
	- Spontaneous subsides 
	- May have variable interval of no symptoms in between (***intercritical gout***)
	- Trigger
		- Purine rich foods 
		- Alcohol
		- Diuretic use 
		- Initial urate lowering therapy
		- Local Trauma 
		- CHF, respiratory hypoxic conditions
- Chronic gouty arthritis
	- After years of flares without treatment
	- Ongoing synovitis, subcutaneous tophi, deformity and bony destruction 
	- Maybe the only manifestation rarely
	- May have only tophi very rarely
- Women 
	- 5-20% of all gout patients
	- postmenopausal and elderly
	- Have osteoarthritis, hypertension or mild renal insufficiency
	- Usually receiving Diuretic 
	- Premenopausal rare but precocious gout in young women has been described caused by decreased urate clearance and renal insufficiency
## Diagnosis
- Labs 
	- Confirm with needle aspiration 
		- as mimicry by 
			- Acute septic arthritis
			- Crystal associated arthropathy
			- Palindromic rheumatism 
			- Psoriatic arthritis
		- Needle shaped MSU crystals typically in acute gout both intracellular and extracellular 
		- Bright negative bifringence on compressed polarised light 
		- Cloudy synovial fluid due to leucocytes (5000-75000) 
		- Large number of crystal means thick, pasty, chalky joint fluid or drainage
		- Always stain and culture for septic arthritis as infection may coexist
		- MSU maybe demonstrated in 1st MTP and knee between flares also 
	- Serum urate levels maybe low or normal at time of flares due to uricosuric property of IL-6 lowering it by

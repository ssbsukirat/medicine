Here are notes on Sarcoidosis based on the provided text excerpts:

# Sarcoidosis

## DEFINITION

- **Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas**.
- It is often multisystemic, requiring involvement in **two or more organs for a specific diagnosis**.
- The finding of granulomas is not specific for sarcoidosis.
- Other conditions causing granulomas must be ruled out, including mycobacterial and fungal infections, malignancy, and environmental agents such as **beryllium**.
- Sarcoidosis can affect virtually every organ, but the **lung is most commonly affected**.
- Other commonly affected organs are the liver, skin, and eye.
- Clinical outcome varies.
    - **Remission occurs in over one-half of patients within a few years** of diagnosis.
    - Remaining patients may develop chronic disease lasting for decades.

## ETIOLOGY

- The cause of sarcoidosis remains unknown despite multiple investigations.
- The most likely etiology is an **infectious or noninfectious environmental agent triggering an inflammatory response in a genetically susceptible host**.
- **Infectious agents:**
    - **_Propionibacterium acnes_** is found at a much higher incidence in lymph nodes of sarcoidosis patients compared to controls. An animal model showed _P. acnes_ can induce a granulomatous response similar to sarcoidosis.
    - A **mycobacterial protein (Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase [mKatG])** has been demonstrated in granulomas of some patients. This protein is resistant to degradation and may represent a persistent antigen. Immune response to this and other mycobacterial proteins has been documented. These studies suggest a _Mycobacterium_ similar to _M. tuberculosis_ could be responsible.
- **Environmental exposures:**
    - Exposure to insecticides and mold has been associated with increased risk.
    - Health care workers appear to have an increased risk.
- Sarcoidosis in a donor organ has occurred after transplantation into a sarcoidosis patient.
- Some authors suggest sarcoidosis is not due to a single agent but represents a particular host response to multiple agents.
- Studies have correlated environmental exposures to genetic markers, supporting the hypothesis that a **genetically susceptible host is a key factor**.

## INCIDENCE, PREVALENCE, AND GLOBAL IMPACT

- Sarcoidosis is seen worldwide.
- Highest prevalence is reported in the **Nordic population**.
- In the United States:
    - More common in **African Americans than whites** (ratio 3:1 to 17:0). Higher incidence in African Americans may be influenced by more extensive/chronic pulmonary disease leading to detection in pulmonology clinics (selection bias).
    - **Women are more susceptible than men**.
- Worldwide prevalence varies (e.g., 20–60 per 100,000 for Japanese, Italians, American whites).
- Higher rates occur in Ireland and Nordic countries.
- In a Swedish community, lifetime risk was 3%.
- Sarcoidosis often occurs in young, otherwise healthy adults.
- Uncommon to diagnose in someone aged <18 years.
- A **second peak in incidence develops around age 60**.
- Median age at diagnosis in one large U.S. study was 55.
- Most cases are sporadic, but a familial form exists.
    - At least **5% of patients have a family member** with sarcoidosis.
    - Irish or African American patients seem to have a two to three times higher rate of familial disease.

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS

- The **granuloma is the pathologic hallmark** of sarcoidosis.
- A distinct feature is the **local accumulation of inflammatory cells**.
- **Initial inflammatory response in the lung:**
    - Extensive studies using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) show an influx of **T helper cells**.
    - Accumulation of activated monocytes.
- **Proposed model:** Antigen-presenting cells present an unknown antigen to the helper T cell using the HLA-CD4 complex.
- Specific **human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes** such as **HLA-DRB1*1101 are associated with increased risk**.
- Different HLA haplotypes are associated with different clinical outcomes.
- The macrophage/helper T-cell cluster leads to activation and increased release of cytokines.
    - IL-2 released from T cells.
    - Interferon γ and TNF released by macrophages.
- The **T cell is a necessary part of the initial inflammatory response**.
    - Patients with advanced, untreated HIV lacking helper T cells rarely develop sarcoidosis.
    - Sarcoidosis becomes unmasked as HIV-infected individuals receive antiretroviral therapy, restoring the immune system.
- Treatment of established pulmonary sarcoidosis with cyclosporine (downregulates helper T-cell responses) seems to have little impact.
- The granulomatous response can resolve with or without therapy.
- A chronic form develops in at least 20% of patients.
- Chronic disease is associated with increased levels in blood and/or BAL of **IL-8, IL-17, and CXCL9**.
- Chronic disease patients release excessive amounts of TNF in inflamed areas.
- Specific gene signatures are associated with more severe disease (cardiac, neurologic, fibrotic pulmonary).

## CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

- Presentation ranges from asymptomatic to organ failure.
- Unclear how often it's asymptomatic.
- In countries with routine chest roentgenogram screening, 20–30% of pulmonary cases are detected in asymptomatic individuals.
- As many as one-third of sarcoidosis patients may be asymptomatic (considering inability to screen for other forms).
- **Most common presenting symptoms are respiratory:** cough and dyspnea.
    - Often present with a 2- to 4-week history.
    - Due to nonspecific nature, diagnosis may take up to a year.
    - Diagnosis is usually suggested by a chest roentgenogram.
- Next two most common complaints are related to cutaneous and ocular disease.
    - Skin lesions are often nonspecific but readily observed, leading to diagnosis. Patients with skin lesions are more likely diagnosed within 6 months of symptoms.
- Nonspecific constitutional symptoms include fatigue, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.
    - **Fatigue is perhaps the most common constitutional symptom**. It's often insidious, recognized as associated with sarcoidosis only upon resolution.
- Overall incidence at diagnosis and common organ involvement are summarized (Table 367-1).
- Over time, skin, eye, and neurologic involvement seem more apparent.
- Frequency of specific organ involvement in the U.S. is affected by age, race, and gender.
    - **Eye disease is more common among African Americans**.
    - Under 40, eye disease is more frequent in women.
    - Over 40, eye disease is more common in men.
- **Löfgren’s syndrome:**
    - A form with a good prognosis (>90% resolution within 2 years).
    - Consists of **erythema nodosum and hilar adenopathy** on chest roentgenogram.
    - Periarticular arthritis may occur without erythema nodosum.
    - Associated with HLA-DRB1*03 in Scandinavian patients (found in two-thirds).
    - > 95% of Scandinavian HLA-DRB1*03 positive patients resolved within 2 years.
        
    - Nearly half of remaining patients had disease >2 years.
    - Applicability to non-Scandinavian populations is undetermined.

## LUNG

- Lung involvement occurs in **>90% of sarcoidosis patients**.
- **Chest roentgenogram** is the most commonly used method for detection.
    - Figure 367-2 illustrates bilateral hilar adenopathy (stage 1 disease).
    - Standard scoring system described by Scadding (1961) remains preferred for characterizing chest involvement.
        - **Stage 1:** Hilar adenopathy alone, often with right paratracheal involvement.
        - **Stage 2:** Combination of adenopathy plus infiltrates.
        - **Stage 3:** Infiltrates alone.
        - **Stage 4:** Fibrosis.
- **CT scan** has changed the diagnostic approach to interstitial lung disease.
    - Not usually considered a monitoring tool except for pulmonary fibrosis.
    - Figure 367-3 demonstrates characteristic features: peribronchial thickening and reticular nodular changes, predominantly subpleural.
    - Peribronchial thickening on CT explains high yield of granulomas from bronchial biopsies.
    - CT scan is more sensitive than chest roentgenogram.
- Lung volumes, mechanics, and diffusion are useful in evaluating interstitial lung diseases.
    - **Diffusion of carbon monoxide (DLCO) is the most sensitive test** for interstitial lung disease.
    - Reduced lung volumes reflect restrictive lung disease.
    - A third of patients have normal lung volumes despite abnormal chest roentgenograms and dyspnea.
- **Infiltrates are usually predominantly an upper lobe process**.
    - Differential diagnosis for upper lobe disease includes hypersensitivity pneumonitis, silicosis, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (noninfectious).
    - Tuberculosis and _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia can present as upper lobe diseases (infectious).
- Approximately **one-half of patients present with obstructive disease** (reduced FEV1/FVC).
- Cough is a very common symptom.
    - Airway involvement causing obstruction underlies cough in most patients.
    - Airway hyperreactivity (methacholine challenge) is positive in some.
    - Some patients with cough respond to traditional bronchodilators alone.
    - High-dose inhaled glucocorticoids alone can be useful.
    - Airway obstruction can be due to large airway stenosis, which can become fibrotic and unresponsive to anti-inflammatory therapy.
- **Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is reported in at least 5%** of patients.
    - Can be due to direct vascular involvement or consequence of fibrotic changes.
    - In patients with end-stage fibrosis awaiting lung transplant, 70% have PAH. This is higher than in other fibrotic lung diseases.
    - In less advanced but symptomatic patients, PAH is noted in up to 50%.
    - Sarcoidosis-associated PAH may respond to therapy, so evaluation should be considered in persistently dyspneic patients.

## SKIN

- Skin involvement is eventually identified in **over a third of patients**.
- Classic cutaneous lesions include:
    - Erythema nodosum.
    - Maculopapular lesions.
    - Hyper- and hypopigmentation.
    - Keloid formation.
    - Subcutaneous nodules.
- **Lupus pernio:**
    - A specific complex of involvement on the bridge of the nose, area beneath the eyes, and cheeks.
    - Figure 367-4 shows chronic inflammatory lesions around the nose, eyes, and cheeks, referred to as lupus pernio.
    - **Diagnostic for a chronic form of sarcoidosis**.
    - More common in African Americans than whites in the U.S..
- Erythema nodosum:
    - A transient rash.
    - Can be seen with hilar adenopathy and uveitis (Löfgren’s syndrome).
    - More common in women and certain demographic groups (whites, Puerto Ricans).
- **Maculopapular lesions are the most common chronic form**.
    - Often overlooked as they are chronic and not painful (Figure 367-5).
    - Initially purplish papules, often indurated.
    - Can become confluent and infiltrate large areas.
    - Color and induration may fade with treatment.
- Diagnosis can be readily made by **skin biopsy** because lesions are caused by noncaseating granulomas.

## EYE

- Frequency of ocular manifestations varies by race.
    - In Japan, >70% develop ocular disease.
    - In the United States, only 30% have eye disease.
    - More common in African Americans than whites in the U.S..
- Most common manifestation is **anterior uveitis**.
- Over a quarter of patients have inflammation at the posterior eye (retinitis, pars planitis).
- Symptoms include photophobia, blurred vision, increased tearing.
- Some asymptomatic patients have active inflammation.
- Initially asymptomatic patients can eventually develop **blindness**.
- **All patients with sarcoidosis should receive a dedicated ophthalmologic examination**.
- **Sicca (dry eyes) is seen in over one-half of chronic patients**.
    - Reflection of prior lacrimal gland disease.
    - May require natural tears or lubricants even without active inflammation.

## LIVER

- Using biopsies, liver involvement is identified in **over one-half** of patients.
- Using liver function studies, only 20–30% have evidence of involvement.
- **Most common abnormality is elevated alkaline phosphatase** (obstructive pattern).
- Elevated transaminase levels can occur.
- Elevated bilirubin is a marker for more advanced disease.
- Only 5% of patients have sufficient symptoms to require specific therapy.
- Symptoms can be due to hepatomegaly.
- More frequently, symptoms result from **extensive intrahepatic cholestasis leading to portal hypertension**. Ascites and esophageal varices can occur in this case.
- It is rare for a patient to require liver transplant.
- Even patients with cirrhosis due to sarcoidosis can respond to systemic therapy.

## BONE MARROW AND SPLEEN

- One or more bone marrow manifestations in many patients.
- **Most common hematologic problem is lymphopenia** (reflection of lymphocyte sequestration into inflamed areas).
- Anemia occurs in 20%.
- Leukopenia is less common.
- Bone marrow examination reveals granulomas in about a third.
- Splenomegaly is detected in 5–10%.
- Splenic biopsy reveals granulomas in 60%.
- **CT scan can be relatively specific for spleen involvement** (Figure 367-6 shows compressed stomach, hypo/hyperdensity areas in spleen).
- Both bone marrow and spleen involvement are **more common in African Americans than whites**.
- These manifestations alone are rarely an indication for therapy.
- Rarely, splenectomy may be indicated for massive symptomatic splenomegaly or profound pancytopenia.
- **Nonthoracic lymphadenopathy can occur in up to 20%**.

## CALCIUM METABOLISM

- **Hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria occur in ~10%**.
- More common in whites than African Americans and in men.
- **Mechanism: increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the granuloma itself**.
    - This causes increased intestinal absorption of calcium.
    - Leads to hypercalcemia with suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH).
- Increased exogenous vitamin D (diet, sunlight) may exacerbate the problem.
- Serum calcium should be part of the initial evaluation of all patients.
- Repeat determination may be useful during summer with increased sun exposure.
- For patients with history of renal calculi, a 24-h urine calcium measurement should be obtained.
- If such patients are placed on calcium supplements, follow-up 24-h urine calcium should be measured.

## RENAL DISEASE

- **Direct kidney involvement occurs in <5%**.
    - Associated with granulomas in the kidney.
    - Can lead to nephritis.
- **Hypercalcemia is the most likely cause of sarcoidosis-associated renal disease**.
- In 1–2% of patients, **acute renal failure may develop as a result of hypercalcemia**.
- Successful treatment of hypercalcemia often improves but usually does not totally resolve renal dysfunction.

## NERVOUS SYSTEM

- Neurologic disease is reported in **5–10%**.
- Appears to be of **equal frequency across all ethnic groups**.
- Any part of the central or peripheral nervous system can be affected.
- Granulomatous inflammation is often visible on **MRI studies**.
    - MRI with gadolinium enhancement may show space-occupying lesions.
    - MRI can be negative due to small lesions or systemic therapy effects.
- **Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) findings:** lymphocytic meningitis with mild protein increase. CSF glucose is usually normal but can be low.
- **More commonly affected areas:**
    - Cranial nerve involvement.
    - Basilar meningitis.
    - Myelopathy.
    - Anterior hypothalamic disease with diabetes insipidus.
    - Seizures and cognitive changes also occur.
- **Cranial nerve involvement:**
    - **Seventh nerve paralysis (facial palsy) can be transient** and mistaken for Bell’s palsy. May resolve within weeks and not recur, possibly occurring before diagnosis.
    - **Optic neuritis** is another cranial nerve manifestation. This is more chronic and usually requires long-term systemic therapy. Can be associated with anterior and posterior uveitis.
- **Differentiating from multiple sclerosis can be difficult**.
    - Optic neuritis occurs in both.
    - Multiple enhancing white matter abnormalities on MRI can suggest MS.
    - **Features suggesting neurosarcoidosis:** meningeal enhancement, hypothalamic involvement, evidence of extraneurologic disease (pulmonary, skin).
    - Differentiating is important because treatment response differs (glucocorticoids, cytotoxic therapy).

## CARDIAC

- Presence of cardiac involvement is influenced by race.
    - Over a quarter of Japanese patients develop cardiac disease.
    - Only 5% of patients in the U.S. and Europe develop symptomatic cardiac disease.
    - No apparent racial predilection between whites and African Americans in the U.S..
- Cardiac disease usually presents as **congestive heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias**.
    - Results from infiltration of heart muscle by granulomas.
- **Diffuse granulomatous involvement** can lead to profound dysfunction (LVEF <10%). Improvement in EF can occur with systemic therapy.
- **Arrhythmias** can occur with diffuse or patchy infiltration.
    - **AV node infiltration can cause heart block** (detected by ECG).
    - **Ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular tachycardia are common causes of death**.
    - Arrhythmias are best detected using 24-h ambulatory monitoring. Electrophysiology studies may be negative.
- Screening tests include routine ECG and echocardiography.
- **Confirmation is usually with MRI or PET scanning**.
- Ventricular arrhythmias are usually multifocal due to patchy granulomas, so ablation therapy is not useful.
- Patients with significant ventricular arrhythmias should be considered for an **implanted defibrillator**, which appears to have reduced death rate.
- Systemic therapy can treat arrhythmias, but malignant arrhythmias may persist up to 6 months after starting successful treatment. Risk of recurrent arrhythmias occurs when medications are tapered.

## MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM

- Direct granulomatous involvement of bone and muscle documented by radiography (x-ray, MRI, PET, gallium scan) or confirmed by biopsy in **~10%**.
    - Figure 367-7 shows increased activity in spleen, ribs, spine on PET/CT.
- A larger percentage complain of **myalgia and arthralgia**.
    - Similar to complaints in other inflammatory diseases (e.g., chronic mononucleosis).
- Fatigue can be overwhelming.
- A link between fatigue and small peripheral nerve fiber disease has been described.

## OTHER ORGAN INVOLVEMENT

- Rarely involves the breast, testes, ovary, or stomach.
- Due to rarity, a mass in these areas **requires a biopsy to rule out other diseases, including cancer**.
- In a study of breast problems in female patients, a breast lesion was more likely a granuloma from sarcoidosis than cancer.
- Physical exam or mammogram cannot reliably differentiate these lesions.
- As women with sarcoidosis age, breast cancer becomes more common.
- **Routine screening including mammography is recommended** for female patients, along with other imaging (ultrasound, MRI) or biopsy as indicated.

## COMPLICATIONS

- Usually a self-limited, non-life-threatening disease.
- **Organ-threatening disease can occur**.
- Complications include **blindness, paraplegia, or renal failure**.
- **Death from sarcoidosis occurs in ~5%** of patients seen in referral clinics.
- Usual causes of death are from **lung, cardiac, neurologic, or liver involvement**.
- In respiratory failure, elevated right atrial pressure is a poor prognostic finding.
- Lung complications include **infections such as mycetoma**, which can lead to massive bleeding.
- Use of immunosuppressive agents can increase the incidence of serious infections.

## LABORATORY FINDINGS

- **Chest roentgenogram** remains the most commonly used tool for lung involvement.
    - Classifies involvement into four stages (1 and 2 have hilar and paratracheal adenopathy).
- **CT scan** increasingly used in evaluating interstitial lung disease.
    - Adenopathy and nodular infiltrate are not specific.
    - Adenopathy up to 2 cm can be seen in other inflammatory diseases (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis).
    - **Adenopathy >2 cm in short axis supports sarcoidosis** over other interstitial lung diseases.
- **PET scan** increasingly replaced gallium-67 scanning to identify areas of granulomatous disease.
    - Can identify potential areas for biopsy.
    - Cardiac PET useful in assessing cardiac sarcoidosis.
    - Hypermetabolic activity may be due to granulomas, not malignancy.
- **MRI** useful for extrapulmonary sarcoidosis assessment.
    - Gadolinium enhancement demonstrated in brain, heart, bone inflammation.
    - May detect asymptomatic lesions.
    - MRI changes appear similar to malignancy and infection.
    - Biopsy may be necessary to determine cause of radiologic abnormality.
- **Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels can be helpful**.
    - Low sensitivity and specificity.
    - Elevated in 60% of acute disease, 20% of chronic disease.
    - Mild elevation has several causes (including diabetes).
    - **Elevations >50% of upper limit of normal seen in few conditions**: sarcoidosis, leprosy, Gaucher’s disease, hyperthyroidism, disseminated granulomatous infections (miliary tuberculosis).
    - Concurrent ACE inhibitor use (e.g., lisinopril) leads to very low ACE level.
- **Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)** often performed during bronchoscopy.
    - **Increase in percentage of lymphocytes supports diagnosis**.
    - CD4/CD8 ratio of increased lymphocytes can be determined.
    - A ratio of **>3.5 is strongly supportive** but less sensitive than lymphocyte increase alone.
    - Other conditions must be considered despite increased BAL lymphocytes.

## DIAGNOSIS

- Requires both **compatible clinical features and pathologic findings**.
- Diagnosis cannot be made with 100% certainty.
- Made with reasonable certainty based on history, physical features, laboratory, and pathologic findings.
- Evaluated based on two scenarios (Figure 367-8):
    - **Scenario 1:** Patient undergoes biopsy revealing noncaseating granuloma (pulmonary or extrapulmonary). If clinical presentation is consistent and no alternative cause identified, sarcoidosis is likely.
    - **Scenario 2:** Signs or symptoms suggest sarcoidosis (e.g., bilateral adenopathy in asymptomatic patient, uveitis, rash). A diagnostic procedure should be performed.
- **Biopsy considerations:**
    - Compatible skin lesion: skin biopsy.
    - Other possible biopsies: liver, extrathoracic lymph node, muscle.
    - Affected organ biopsy may be difficult (brain, spinal cord).
    - Likelihood of positive endomyocardial biopsy is low.
    - Due to high pulmonary involvement, lung approached by bronchoscopy.
        - Transbronchial biopsy, bronchial biopsy, or transbronchial needle aspirate can be performed.
        - **EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspirate assists with mediastinal adenopathy** (stage 1 or 2).
        - **Transbronchial biopsy has higher yield for parenchymal disease** (stage 3).
        - These tests are complementary.
- If biopsy shows granulomas, **alternative diagnoses must be excluded** (infection, malignancy).
    - Bronchoscopic washings for fungal and TB cultures.
    - More tissue provided is better for pathologist.
    - Needle aspirate may be adequate in classic cases, insufficient if lymphoma or fungal infection likely.
    - Few granulomas from needle aspirate near lymphoma edge may not clarify.
    - Mediastinoscopy provides larger sample to confirm/exclude lymphoma in mediastinum.
- Alternatively, **evidence of extrathoracic disease (e.g., eye involvement) further supports diagnosis**.
- For negative pathology, **positive supportive tests increase likelihood**.
    - **Elevated ACE level**: Can be elevated in other granulomatous diseases but not malignancy.
    - **Positive PET scan**: Supports diagnosis if multiple organs affected.
    - **Increased BAL lymphocytes or CD4/CD8 ratio >3.5**: Supports diagnosis.
- **Supportive findings combined with non-diagnostic clinical features improve probability**.
    - Non-diagnostic features: uveitis, renal stones, hypercalcemia, seventh cranial nerve paralysis, erythema nodosum.
    - A sarcoidosis diagnostic score exists to quantitate likelihood.
- Diagnosis is never certain. Other features may lead to alternative diagnosis over time. Evidence of new organ involvement may eventually confirm diagnosis.

## PROGNOSIS

- Risk of death or organ function loss remains low.
- Poor outcomes usually occur in patients presenting with **advanced disease** where treatment has little impact.
- In these cases, irreversible fibrotic changes have often occurred.
- **Overall mortality is approximately 5%**.
- Mortality is associated with:
    - **Advanced pulmonary fibrosis** (>20% fibrosis on CT and/or DLCO <50%).
    - Pulmonary hypertension.
- Reported mortality has increased in the U.S. and England over the past 20 years. Reason unclear (heightened awareness or widespread immunosuppression usage).
- Majority present during the granulomatous phase.
- Many patients resolve disease within 2–5 years (acute, self-limiting sarcoidosis).
- Chronic disease does not resolve within first 2–5 years.
- **Risk factors for chronic disease at presentation:**
    - Fibrosis on chest roentgenogram.
    - Presence of lupus pernio.
    - Bone cysts.
    - Cardiac or neurologic disease (except isolated seventh nerve paralysis).
    - Presence of renal calculi due to hypercalciuria.
- Patients requiring glucocorticoids for any manifestation in the first 6 months have >50% chance of chronic disease.
- <10% of patients requiring no systemic therapy in the first 6 months required chronic therapy.

## TREATMENT

- Decision to treat is based on two indications: **avoid danger or improve quality of life**.
- Dangerous outcome: organ- or life-threatening disease (eye, heart, nervous system).
- Asymptomatic elevated liver function tests or abnormal chest roentgenogram probably do not benefit from treatment, but should be monitored.
- Improving quality of life is an important indication.
- Must be careful to avoid toxicity from therapy more problematic than disease.
- One approach is summarized in Figs. 367-9 (acute) and 367-10 (chronic).
- **Acute disease management (Fig. 367-9):**
    - No therapy is viable for patients with no or mild symptoms.
    - Topical therapy is preferable for symptoms confined to one organ.
    - For multiorgan or extensive disease, systemic therapy is outlined.
    - **Glucocorticoids remain the drugs of choice**.
    - Decision to continue glucocorticoids or add steroid-sparing agents depends on tolerability, duration, dosage.
- **Commonly used drugs (Table 367-2)**: Dosage and monitoring are summarized.
    - Evidence-based recommendations mostly for pulmonary disease (most trials).
    - Recommendations for extrapulmonary disease are usually similar with modifications.
        - Glucocorticoid dosage usually higher for neurosarcoidosis, lower for cutaneous disease.
        - Higher doses initially for cardiac sarcoidosis suggested, but one study found >40 mg/d prednisone associated with worse outcome due to toxicity.
- **Systemic therapies are usually immunosuppressive:** glucocorticoids, cytotoxics, or biologics.
- Toxicity of prolonged glucocorticoids often leads to **steroid-sparing alternatives**.
- **Antimalarial drugs (e.g., hydroxychloroquine)**: More effective for skin than pulmonary disease.
- Minocycline may be useful for cutaneous sarcoidosis.
- **Cytotoxic agents** (methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide) used for pulmonary and other extrapulmonary disease.
    - **Methotrexate** is the most widely studied cytotoxic. Works in ~two-thirds of patients, regardless of manifestation.
    - Retrospective study: methotrexate and azathioprine equally effective, but methotrexate had less toxicity.
    - Specific monitoring guidelines recommended (Table 367-2).
- Cytokine modulators (thalidomide, pentoxifylline) used in limited cases.
- **Biologic anti-TNF agents** studied.
    - Prospective randomized trials completed for etanercept, golimumab, infliximab.
    - Etanercept has limited role as steroid-sparing agent.
    - Golimumab not significantly different than placebo in chronic pulmonary disease (possibly due to low dose).
    - **Infliximab significantly improved lung function** in glucocorticoid/cytotoxic pretreated chronic patients.
    - Difference between etanercept and infliximab similar to Crohn’s disease (infliximab effective, etanercept not).
    - Higher risk for TB reactivation with infliximab vs. etanercept.
    - Differential response may be due to mechanism: etanercept (TNF receptor antagonist), infliximab (monoclonal antibody against TNF, also binds surface TNF causing cell lysis). Cell lysis effect documented in Crohn's.
    - **Adalimumab** (humanized monoclonal anti-TNF) appears effective at higher strengths (like Crohn’s).
- Role of newer therapeutic agents is evolving.
- **TNF may be an important target, especially in chronic disease**.
- These agents are not a panacea; sarcoidosis-like disease has occurred in patients treated with anti-TNF agents for non-sarcoidosis indications.

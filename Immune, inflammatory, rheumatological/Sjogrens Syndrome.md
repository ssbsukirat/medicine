# Definition, Incidence, and Prevalence

- **Sjögren’s syndrome is a prototype autoimmune disease**.
- Characterized by **lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands**.
- Results in **xerostomia (dry mouth)** and **dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca)**.
- Also characterized by **profound B-cell hyperactivity**.
- Presents with a **wide clinical spectrum** from organ-specific to systemic disease.
- Can occur **alone or in association with other systemic rheumatic diseases**.
- Common associated diseases include **rheumatoid arthritis, limited scleroderma, and systemic lupus erythematosus**.
- Displays a **high probability of lymphoma development**.
- Primarily affects **middle-aged women** (female-to-male ratio 10-20:1).
- May occur at **any age, including childhood**.
- Patients with **earlier disease onset** express a **more aggressive disease phenotype**.
- Aggressive phenotype manifested by a **high occurrence of systemic manifestations and serum autoantibodies**.
- Prevalence is **∼0.5–1%**.
- **5–20% of patients with other autoimmune diseases** can express **sicca manifestations**.

# Pathogenesis

- Autoimmune phenomena include **lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands** (primarily salivary and lachrymal).
- Autoimmune phenomena include **B lymphocyte hyperreactivity**.
- B lymphocyte hyperreactivity is mainly manifested by **hypergammaglobulinemia**.
- B lymphocyte hyperreactivity is mainly manifested by the presence of **serum autoantibodies toward non-organ-specific antigens**.
- Autoantibodies include those toward **immunoglobulins (rheumatoid factors)**.
- Autoantibodies include those toward **extractable cellular antigens (Ro52, Ro60, and La)**.
- Major infiltrating cells in affected exocrine glands are **activated T lymphocytes**.
- In labial minor salivary gland tissues with extensive lymphocytic infiltrations, **B-cell populations prevail**.
- Other cellular subsets detected in labial minor salivary gland histopathology include **follicular, myeloid, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells**.
- Other cellular subsets detected include **macrophages**.
- **Inflammasome activation** in the salivary gland lesion has been associated with **adverse predictors for lymphoma development**.
- **Macrophages positive for interleukin (IL) 18** in the salivary gland lesion have been associated with **adverse predictors for lymphoma development**.
- The interplay of **endogenous triggers** (e.g., intracellular stress, inappropriate overexpression of endogenous nucleic acids) and **exogenous triggers** (e.g., viruses, hormonal triggers, stressful life events) seems crucial.
- This interplay occurs in a background of a **genetically determined hyperactive immune response**.
- **Ductal and acinar epithelial cells** appear to play a **significant role** in the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmune injury.
- These epithelial cells inappropriately express **costimulatory molecules and intracellular autoantigens (Ro and La)** on their cell surfaces.
- This allows epithelial cells to provide **signals essential for lymphocytic activation**.
- Epithelial cells produce **proinflammatory cytokines and lymphocyte-attracting chemokines** necessary for sustaining the autoimmune lesion.
- These substances allow the formation of **ectopic germinal centers**.
- Epithelial cells express functional receptors of innate immunity, particularly **Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7, and 9**molecules.
- TLRs may account for the **initiation of autoimmune reactivity**.
- Epithelial cells display immunoregulatory molecules such as **ICAM and CD40**.
- Glandular epithelial cells have an active role in the production of **B cell–activating factor (BAFF)**.
- BAFF is induced after stimulation with **type I and II interferons**.
- **Circulating BAFF** is elevated in serum of Sjögren’s patients, especially those with hypergammaglobulinemia and serum autoantibodies.
- Elevated BAFF probably accounts for the **antiapoptotic effect on B lymphocytes**.
- In contrast to B and T lymphocytes, glandular epithelial cells display **increased rates of apoptotic death**.
- Established risk genetic loci implicated include the **human leukocyte antigen DQA1*0501 allele**.
- Established risk genetic loci include **variants involved in the interferon/BAFF axis (IRF 5, STAT 4, BAFF)**.
- Established risk genetic loci include **variants involved in B-cell function (EBF1, BLK)**.
- Established risk genetic loci include **variants involved in chronic inflammation (TNFAIP3)**.

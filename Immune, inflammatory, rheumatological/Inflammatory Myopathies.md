Here are notes created from the provided chapter excerpts:

# Inflammatory Myopathies

- Major types include **dermatomyositis (DM)**, **polymyositis (PM)**, **immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM)**, **antisynthetase syndrome (AS)**, and **inclusion body myositis (IBM)**.
- Other types include those caused by infection, eosinophilic myositis, granulomatous myositis, and myositis triggered by checkpoint inhibitors.
- Inflammatory cell infiltrates can also be seen in muscle biopsies in hereditary (e.g., muscular dystrophies, metabolic myopathies) and toxic myopathies.

# TABLE 365-1 Inflammatory Myopathies: Clinical and Laboratory Features

- Epidemiologic studies suggest the incidence of IM grouped together is **>4 cases per 100,000**.
- Prevalence is in the range of **14–32 per 100,000**.
- Defining actual incidence/prevalence of individual myositides is limited by different diagnostic criteria, increasing AS recognition, and frequent misdiagnosis of IBM and IMNM.
- **Idiopathic PM** without overlap syndrome is quite rare.
- DM, IBM, and IMNM occur in roughly similar frequencies.
- **DM** can occur in children (juvenile DM).
- **IBM** always occurs in adults and is the most common cause of myopathy in those aged **>50**.
- DM, PM, and AS are **more common in women**.
- IBM is **more common in men**.

# DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

- The approach to patients with suspected myopathy is detailed in Chap. 449.
- **First step** with weakness: localize lesion site by history and clinical findings (Chap. 24).
- Weakness can be caused by processes in the cerebral hemispheres, spinal cord, anterior horn cell, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction, or muscle.
- History, medication use, family history, clinical exam, and pattern of muscle involvement help differentiate myopathies from other neuromuscular disorders and different myopathy types.
    - **Atrophy with fasciculations** suggests a **neurogenic process** such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
    - **Fatigable weakness** on examination points to a **neuromuscular junction defect** such as myasthenia gravis.
    - Concomitant **sensory symptoms** suggest a central process (spinal cord disorder) or a polyneuropathy.
    - **Scapular winging, calf hypertrophy or atrophy, and early contractures** before significant weakness strongly suggest a **muscular dystrophy**, particularly with positive family history.
    - A **heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, and dilated nailfold capillaries** is diagnostic for **DM**.
    - **Atrophy and weakness of flexor forearm muscles and quadriceps in a person aged >50** is most likely **IBM**.
- When the site of the lesion cannot be localized clinically, laboratory testing is required.
    - **Serum creatine kinase (CK)** is the most sensitive laboratory marker of muscle destruction.
    - A markedly elevated CK (>2000 U/L) is almost always due to a myopathy.
    - A slightly elevated CK can also be seen in neurogenic disorders.
    - Not all myopathies are associated with elevated CK levels.
    - **Myositis-associated and myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs)** help to distinguish subtypes of IM.
    - **Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conductions studies (NCS)** are useful in localizing the lesion but less specific for myopathy cause.
    - EMG can be useful for guiding muscle biopsy location.
    - **Imaging skeletal muscle** can assess muscle involvement and reveal fatty replacement, atrophy, or edema.
    - A **muscle biopsy** is usually required to definitively distinguish myopathies.
        - Different IM forms have distinctive histopathologic abnormalities.
        - Patient with classic DM rash: muscle or skin biopsy can be done, may be unnecessary if a DM-specific MSA is present.
        - **Suspected PM**: muscle biopsy should be performed to exclude IBM (if not clinically apparent) and other myopathy causes.
        - **IMNM diagnosis**: by definition based upon histologic findings.
        - Biopsy muscle: should be clinically affected but not too weak (e.g., Grade 4/5 strength).
        - Always coordinated with an experienced muscle histopathology laboratory.
- Patients with severe muscle pain, subjective weakness, and fatigue with normal strength/function on exam are **not likely to have IM**.
- **Polymyalgia rheumatica** should be considered in older individuals with elevated ESR/CRP but normal CK/EMG.
- **Fibromyalgia** is likely in patients with a normal laboratory workup.
- Generally, a muscle biopsy is not indicated unless there is objective weakness, abnormal EMG, or elevated CK.

# SPECIFIC DISORDERS

## DERMATOMYOSITIS

- **Clinical Features:**
    - Manifests with **symmetric, proximal greater than distal weakness**.
    - Characteristic **rash**: heliotrope rash (eyelids/periorbital edema), Gottron sign (extensor surfaces of joints), Gottron papules (raised over knuckles) (Fig. 365-1), V-sign (anterior neck/chest), shawl sign (back of neck/shoulders), nail bed telangiectasias (Fig. 365-1), subcutaneous calcium deposits.
    - Weakness and rash usually accompany each other but can be separated by several months.
    - Spectrum of involvement: **amyopathic DM** (rash only), weakness mainly with little/no visible skin changes.
    - Patients can complain of myalgias, arthralgias, dysphagia, and dysarthria.
    - Cutaneous disease activity: highly relevant, associated with overall reduction in life quality.
    - Pruritus can be especially debilitating.
    - **Dyspnea** can occur from ventilatory muscle weakness or intrinsic pulmonary problems (interstitial lung disease (ILD), bronchopneumonia, alveolitis).
    - Pulmonary manifestations: often associated with antisynthetase antibodies. Myositis with AS can be considered a distinct disorder.
    - Presentation: children (juvenile DM) or adults.
    - **Adult-onset cases**: higher risk for **malignancy** (~15% within first 2–3 years).
- **Laboratory Features:**
    - **Serum CK levels**: elevated in 70–80% of patients.
    - 10% with normal CK: serum aldolase may be increased.
    - **Antinuclear antibodies**: positive but nonspecific finding.
    - **MSAs**: MDA5, TIF1, Mi-2, NXP2.
        - **anti-MDA5**: associated with amyopathic DM, severe palmar rash, digital ulcers, and rapidly progressive ILD.
        - **anti-TIF1 (p155) and anti-NXP2**: associated with an increased risk of cancer.
        - **anti-Mi-2**: often associated with more benign DM and favorable response to treatment.
    - **EMG of weak muscles**: increased insertional/spontaneous activity (positive sharp waves, fibrillation potentials, complex repetitive discharges), early recruitment of small amplitude, short duration, polyphasic motor units. Findings are nonspecific.
    - **Skeletal muscle MRI**: edema in affected muscles, sometimes fasciitis findings.
- **Histopathology and Pathogenesis:**
    - Muscle biopsy:
        - Characteristic abnormality: **perifascicular atrophy** (Fig. 365-2A), present in perhaps only 50%.
        - Immunohistochemical staining for **myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA)**: diagnostically more sensitive and highly specific (Fig. 365-2B).
        - Inflammatory cell infiltrate: predominantly perivascular in perimysium (macrophages, B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells).
    - Skin biopsies: cell-poor interface dermatitis (analogous to muscle perifascicular atrophy), basal layer keratinocytes most damaged. Inflammatory infiltrate typically absent/minimal, located at dermis/epidermis border.
    - Pathogenesis:
        - Traditionally attributed to antibody-mediated attack on endothelial cells, complement-mediated capillary destruction, watershed ischemia.
        - Recent studies: this is not likely. Immunoglobulin deposition largely absent, complement deposition may be secondary.
        - Increasing evidence: microvasculopathy, skin/muscle damage primarily due to toxicity from **type I interferon (IFN)–mediated pathways**, most likely IFN-β.
- **Prognosis:**
    - In absence of malignancy: generally favorable (5-year survival 70–93%).
    - Poor prognostic features: increased age, associated ILD, cardiac disease, late/previous inadequate treatment.

## POLYMYOSITIS

- **Clinical Features:**
    - Heterogeneous group of disorders.
    - Usually presents with **symmetric and proximal weakness** that worsens over weeks to months.
    - Can have associated heart, lung, and joint involvement.
    - Increased risk of cancer. Older studies likely misdiagnosed IBM/dystrophies as PM, possibly underestimating cancer risk compared to DM.
- **Laboratory Features:**
    - **CK levels**: **always elevated** in uncontrolled PM.
    - A normal CK should alert clinicians to possibility of IBM.
    - **EMG and skeletal muscle imaging**: abnormal, but findings are **not specific** (Fig. 365-3). MRI shows edema/inflammation (e.g., rectus femoris), contrasting with IBM MRI (vastus lateralis/medialis involvement, relative sparing of rectus femoris) (Fig. 365-7F, G).
- **Histopathology and Pathogenesis:**
    - Muscle pathology varies substantially due to heterogeneity.
    - Most often: nonspecific inflammatory cells in perimysial > endomysial locations.
    - Small minority: mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate surrounding fibers with sarcolemmal **MHC-I expression** (Fig. 365-4).
    - Debate: whether true invasion of myofibers occurs in PM or always indicates IBM.
    - Inflammatory infiltrate: predominantly **CD8+ T cells and macrophages** in endomysial, perimysial, and perivascular regions.
    - Pathogenesis: poorly understood due to heterogeneity.
- **Prognosis:**
    - Most patients improve with immunotherapies but usually require lifelong treatment.
    - Some studies suggest less response than DM, but older series likely included misdiagnosed patients (IMNM, IBM, dystrophies) not responsive to immunotherapy.
    - Poor prognostic features: cancer, increased age, lung/cardiac involvement, late/previously inadequate treatment.

## OVERLAP SYNDROMES

- Term applied when **DM or PM is associated with other well-defined connective tissue diseases (CTDs)**.
- Associated CTDs: scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis.
- Myositis associated with these syndromes: usually **responsive to immunotherapies**.

## IMMUNE-MEDIATED NECROTIZING MYOPATHY

- Also known as autoimmune necrotizing myopathy.
- **Clinical Features:**
    - Acute or insidious onset of **symmetric, proximal more than distal weakness**.
    - Dysphagia, dysarthria, or myalgia may occur.
    - May have underlying CTD (usually scleroderma or MCTD), cancer (paraneoplastic), or be idiopathic.
    - Associated with specific autoantibodies: **anti-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme reductase (HMGCR)** and **anti-signal recognition particle (SRP)**.
    - **Anti-HMGCR myopathy**: seen in patients receiving statins (>50 years), can develop in children/young adults without statin history. Can mimic a limb girdle muscular dystrophy. Does not improve when statins are discontinued (unlike toxic statin myopathy).
    - **Anti-SRP myopathies**: notable for anti-SRP antibodies and typically a **subacute, aggressive, and relatively refractory course**.
- **Laboratory Features:**
    - **CK levels**: **markedly elevated** (usually >10 × normal).
    - Associated with anti-HMGCR or anti-SRP antibodies.
    - **EMG**: often shows increased insertional/spontaneous activity, including myotonic discharges.
    - **Skeletal muscle imaging**: nonspecifically abnormal.
- **Histopathology and Pathogenesis:**
    - Muscle biopsies: **multifocal necrotic and regenerating muscle fibers**.
    - **Paucity of inflammatory cells** (Fig. 365-5).
    - Some anti-HMGCR myopathy patients: endomysial, macrophage-predominant infiltrates similar to PM.
    - **Overexpression of MHC-I and membrane attack complex (MAC)**: may be evident on sarcolemma of nonnecrotic fibers.
    - MAC deposition on capillaries.
    - Pathogenesis: not completely understood, may be **complement mediated**.
- **Prognosis:**
    - Generally much **more difficult to treat** than DM or PM.
    - **Aggressive immunotherapy** is usually required.
    - Progressive course despite immunotherapy, marked weakness/atrophy can lead to misdiagnosis of limb girdle muscular dystrophy.
    - May be an increased incidence of cancer in anti-HMGCR myopathy; malignancy workup should be done.

## ANTISYNTHETASE SYNDROME

- **Clinical Features:**
    - Presence of **myositis, nonerosive arthritis, ILD, Raynaud’s phenomenon, mechanic hands, and fever**.
    - Associated with **antibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase**.
    - Some patients have an erythematous rash.
    - Muscle biopsies: share histopathologic features of DM, likely accounting for some patients being classified as DM.
- **Laboratory Features:**
    - **Antibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases**: most common MSA (25–35% of myositis patients).
    - **Anti-Jo-1** is the most common aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibody.
    - **CK**: usually elevated in patients with AS and myositis.
    - **ILD**: reduced forced vital capacity and diffusion capacity on pulmonary function tests. Spiral chest CT best for demonstrating honeycomb pattern.
    - **Skeletal muscle MRI and EMG**: abnormalities similar to DM, PM, and IMNM.
- **Histopathology and Pathogenesis:**
    - Muscle biopsies: predilection for **perimysial damage** (fragmentation, alkaline phosphatase staining (Fig. 365-6)), PDCs and macrophages in perimysium/around blood vessels, MAC deposition on capillaries.
    - Similar to DM: **perifascicular muscle fiber damage**.
    - Unlike DM: AS has more perifascicular muscle fiber necrosis, DM has more perifascicular atrophy.
    - MHC-I and MAC deposits on muscle fibers may be seen on sarcolemma of perifascicular fibers (Fig. 365-6C).
- **Prognosis:**
    - Most patients respond to treatment, although responses are **less complete** than for DM and PM.
    - **ILD** can be particularly **refractory** to treatment.
    - Unlike DM, PM, and IMNM: there does not appear to be an increased risk of **malignancy**.

## INCLUSION BODY MYOSITIS

- **Clinical Features:**
    - Usually manifests in patients **over the age of 50 years**.
    - Slightly more common in **men** than women.
    - **Slowly progressive weakness and muscle atrophy**.
    - Predilection for early involvement of the **wrist and finger flexors** in the arms and **quadriceps** in the legs (Fig. 365-7).
    - Weakness: often **asymmetric**.
    - **Dysphagia** is common and rarely can be the presenting feature.
    - Clinical features help distinguish from PM and other myopathies.
    - Mean duration from onset of symptoms to use of wheelchair or scooter is ~15 years.
    - **No known increased risk of malignancy**.
- **Laboratory Features:**
    - **CK levels**: can be normal or only slightly elevated (usually <10 times normal).
    - Antibodies targeting **cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A (cN-1A)**: detected in 1/3 to >2/3 of patients, a **highly specific diagnostic biomarker**.
    - Other blood biomarkers: abnormal population of large granular lymphocytes, reduced CD4/CD8 ratio with increased CD8 count.
    - **Needle EMG**: may demonstrate large-amplitude, long-duration motor unit potentials (can be misinterpreted as neurogenic), reflect chronicity.
    - **Muscle MRI**: predilection for flexor digitorum profundus (arms), vastus medialis/lateralis (legs), with sparing of the rectus femoris.
- **Histopathology and Pathogenesis:**
    - Muscle biopsies:
        - **Endomysial inflammatory infiltrates**: predominantly CD8+ T cells and macrophages surrounding/invading nonnecrotic muscle fibers.
        - **MHC-1 expression** on the sarcolemma.
        - Fibers with **rimmed vacuoles** (Fig. 365-8A).
        - **Cytochrome oxidase (COX)–negative fibers** (Fig. 365-8B).
        - **Inclusions** on light or electron microscopy (Fig. 365-8A, D).
        - Inclusions contain beta-sheet misfolded proteins (amyloid), difficult to appreciate with routine Congo red (seen on frozen, not paraffin sections).
        - **Immunostaining for p62**: most sensitive stain for inclusions (Fig. 365-8C).
        - Rimmed vacuoles may not be seen in 20–30% of biopsies.
        - Mitochondrial abnormalities (ragged red, COX-negative fibers) and p62 inclusions help distinguish from PM when rimmed vacuoles are absent.
    - Pathogenesis: poorly understood.
    - Adaptive immune system abnormalities (T-cell inflammation) and specific autoantibody (cN-1A) indicate an autoimmune attack.
    - Chronic inflammatory environment: may alter protein synthesis/degradation via aberrant immunoproteasome expression.
    - "Degenerative" features: aggregation of proteins including ER stress/autophagy markers (p62, LC3).
    - ER stress/autophagy involvement seen in other autoimmune diseases (PBC, IBD, ankylosing spondylitis), some refractory to immunotherapy.
- **Prognosis:**
    - Myopathy is **slowly progressive**.
    - **Not typically responsive to immunotherapies**.
    - Most require scooter or wheelchair within 10–15 years of onset.

# TREATMENT OF THE IM (Table 365-2)

- DM, PM, AS, and IMNM are typically **responsive to immunotherapy**.
    
- **First-line treatment**: High-dose glucocorticoids (i.e., starting dose of prednisone 0.75–1.0 mg/kg per day).
    
- **Second-line agents**: methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, immunoglobulin, or rituximab.
    
- When to start second-line agents: weigh risks of immunosuppression vs. benefits (faster improvement, steroid-sparing, avoidance of long-term glucocorticoid morbidity).
    
- Start a second-line agent with glucocorticoids:
    
    - Severe weakness or other organ involvement (myocarditis, ILD).
    - Increased risk of steroid complications (diabetics, osteoporosis, postmenopausal women).
    - Patients with IMNM (known difficult-to-treat myositis).
- If initiating with prednisone alone: add a second-line agent if failure to significantly improve after 2–4 months or cannot taper prednisone to a low dose.
    
- **IMNM Treatment:**
    
    - Most do not respond to prednisone alone or prednisone plus a second-line agent.
    - Many require **triple therapy**: prednisone, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
    - If triple therapy fails: rituximab.
    - Recent reports: anti-HMGCR myopathy may respond to monotherapy with **IVIG** (trial underway).
    - MAC deposition on sarcolemma in IMNM suggests complement-mediated muscle destruction.
    - Ongoing international trial: investigating a complement inhibitor in anti-HMGCR and anti-SRP myopathies.
- **IBM Treatment:**
    
    - Does not typically respond to any known immunotherapies.
    - **Mainstay of treatment**: physical and occupational therapy to improve function.
    - **Dysphagia**: swallowing therapy (sometimes esophageal dilation or cricopharyngeal myotomy).

# GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR USE OF SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPIES

- **Glucocorticoids:**
    
    - Initiation: prednisone (0.75–1.5 mg/kg up to 100 mg) daily morning single dose (common adult dose 60 mg daily).
    - Severe weakness or comorbidities (ILD, myocarditis): short course of intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days) recommended prior to oral glucocorticoids.
    - Maintenance: high-dose prednisone until strength normalizes or plateaus (usually 3–6 months).
    - Taper: 5 mg every 2–4 weeks. Slow taper (2.5 mg every 2–4 weeks) once dose is ≤20 mg.
    - Goal: taper prednisone to **≤10 mg daily**.
    - Many will require small prednisone dose or second-line agent for sustained remission.
    - Monitoring: Serum CK levels monitored, but dose adjustments primarily based on **objective clinical examination**, not CK levels or subjective response.
    - No response after adequate high-dose prednisone trial: consider alternative diagnoses (IBM, inflammatory muscular dystrophy), repeat muscle biopsy.
    - **Relapse vs. Steroid Myopathy:**
        - Features suggesting **steroid myopathy**: weakness on high dosage, normal serum CK, steroid excess features (ecchymoses, moon facies), absence of muscle membrane irritability on EMG.
        - Features suggesting **relapse**: becoming weaker during prednisone taper, increasing serum CK levels, abnormal spontaneous activity on EMG.
- **SECOND-LINE THERAPIES**
    
    - **Methotrexate:**
        - Usually the second-line treatment of choice (believed to work faster).
        - Oral dose: start 5 or 7.5 mg/week, gradually increase up to 25 mg/week.
        - No improvement after 1 month of 25 mg/week oral: switch to weekly parenteral (usually subcutaneous), dose escalation by 5 mg weekly. Rarely >35 mg/week used.
        - Major side effects: alopecia, stomatitis, ILD, teratogenicity, oncogenicity, risk of infection, pulmonary fibrosis, bone marrow/renal/liver toxicity.
        - Concomitantly treated with folate or folinic acid.
    - **Azathioprine:**
        - Initial dose: 50 mg/d in adults, increase by 50 mg every 2 weeks up to 2–3 mg/kg/day.
        - ~12% patients: systemic reaction (fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia) requires discontinuation.
        - Major practical limitation: **6–18 months usually required before benefit**.
        - Prescreening for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency: associated with severe bone marrow toxicity.
    - **Mycophenolate Mofetil:**
        - Inhibits T and B lymphocyte proliferation by blocking purine synthesis.
        - Appears effective in different forms of myositis.
        - **Second-line treatment of choice for myositis patients with ILD**.
        - Starting dose: 1.0 g twice daily, increase to 3 g daily in divided doses if necessary.
        - Excreted through kidneys: decrease dose (no >1 g/d total dose) in renal insufficiency.
        - Advantage: **lack of renal or hepatic toxicity**.
    - **Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG):**
        - Used in patients **refractory to prednisone and at least one second-line immunosuppressive agent**.
        - Recent reports: may be treatment of choice and effective as monotherapy in anti-HMGCR myopathy.
        - Dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2–5 days.
        - Repeat infusions: given at monthly intervals for at least 3 months.
        - Subsequently: intervals can be lengthened (2 g/kg every 2 months) or dosage decreased (1 g/kg per month).
    - **Rituximab:**
        - Monoclonal antibody directed against CD20+ B cells.
        - Large RCT found no benefit (flawed design).
        - Most authorities: can be beneficial in some patients **refractory to prednisone and at least one of the other second-line agents**.
        - Typical dosage: 750 mg/m2 (up to 1 g) IV with a second infusion 2 weeks later.
        - Repeat courses: 375 mg/m2 (single infusion or 2 weeks apart) every 6–18 months as needed.

# MYOSITIS ASSOCIATED WITH CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS

- Autoimmune neurologic complications (inflammatory neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, myositis) can occur with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1) for cancer.
- Myositis symptoms: often develop muscle pain and weakness (axial, proximal limbs) after one or two cycles.
- **Myocarditis** can also develop.
- Co-occurrence with MG: diplopia, extraocular weakness, dysphagia, dysarthria.
- Diagnosis support: elevated CK (myositis), acetylcholine receptor antibodies or decremental response on slow repetitive nerve stimulation (MG).
- Muscle biopsies: endomysial inflammatory cell infiltrates (macrophages expressing PD-L1, CD8+ lymphocytes expressing PD-1), overexpression of MHC-I on sarcolemma, scattered necrotic/regenerating fibers.
- Treatment:
    - **Immune checkpoint inhibitor should be discontinued**.
    - Most patients require concurrent treatment with glucocorticoids or IVIG.
    - Patients generally improve over several months, during which time immunotherapy can be tapered.
    - Rare reports: patients with mild myositis successfully re-treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

# MYOSITIS ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 INFECTION

- Early series of hospitalized COVID-19 patients report: as many as 44% experienced muscle pain or fatigue, 33% had elevated CK levels.
- Rare cases complicated by myoglobinuria.
- Histopathology: can demonstrate inflammatory cell infiltration and necrotic muscle fibers.
- Major concern during pandemic: IM patients treated with immunotherapies may be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection or at greater risk for severe complications.
- Recommendation: strongly encourage patients to wear masks and maintain social distancing.

# GLOBAL ISSUES

- Lack of epidemiologic data regarding incidence/prevalence of various IM subtypes throughout the world.
- Complicating factors: disease awareness, inability to obtain/process muscle biopsies and MSAs, particularly in less developed countries.
- Each of these disorders occurs throughout the world.
- Specific environmental triggers and genetic risk factors are likely variable.
- Report from Japan: 28% of IBM patients had evidence of exposure to hepatitis C (much higher than Western Hemisphere, PM, healthy controls in Japan).
- HIV-associated PM and IBM: more commonly encountered in areas endemic for HIV. Recent studies suggest most "PM" patients turn out to have IBM and can develop symptoms earlier (e.g., in the 30s).
- Pyomyositis and parasitic myositis: clearly more common in the tropics.
- Prevalence of different cancers varies globally: important consideration for paraneoplastic myositis (DM, PM, IMNM). Nasopharyngeal cancer particularly common in Asia; assessment should be considered in patients from high-risk regions.

- chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology
- Symmetric polyarthritis
- Most common form of chronic inflammatory arthritis
# Clinical features
- incidence max 25-55 years , plateau till 75 then decline
- Symptoms due to Inflammation of joint tendon bursae 
- Early morning stiffness >1hour easing with physical activity
- Earliest small joints of hand and feet 
- Initial maybe monoarticular, oligoarticular (<4 joints) or polyarticular (>5 joints) usually symmetric
- Initially may have too few joints to classify as RA so maybe ***undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis*** with high risk of RA progression in 
	- Higher number of tender or swollen joints 
	- RF positive
	- Anti CCP 
	- High physical disability scores 
- Wrist, MCP, PIP most common involved
- DIP maybe involved but usually implies coexistent [[Osteoarthritis]]
- Flexor tendon tenosynovitis
	- Hallmark
	- Reduced range of motion
	- Reduced grip strength
	- ***Trigger*** fingers
	- May cause tendon rupture
	- Flexor pollicis Longus most common 
- Deformities
	- Ulnar deviation
		- Subluxation of MCP joint with subluxation of proximal phalanx to volar side of hand 
	- ***Swan neck*** 
		- Hyperextension of PIP with flexed DIP 
	- ***Boutonniere deformity***
		- Flexion of PIP with hyperextension of DIP 
	- ***Z line deformity***
		- Subluxation of first MCP with hyperextension of first IP joint 
	- ***Piano key movement of ulnar styloid***
		- Inflammation around ulnar styloid and tenosynovitis of extensor carpi ulnaris 
		- Subluxation of distal ulna 
- MTP in feet is early but later ***pes planovalgas or flat feet*** seen

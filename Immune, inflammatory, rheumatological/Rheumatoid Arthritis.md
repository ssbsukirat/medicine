- chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology
- Symmetric polyarthritis
- Most common form of chronic inflammatory arthritis
# Clinical features
- incidence max 25-55 years , plateau till 75 then decline
- Symptoms due to Inflammation of joint tendon bursae 
- Early morning stiffness >1hour easing with physical activity
- Earliest small joints of hand and feet 
- Initial maybe monoarticular, oligoarticular (<4 joints) or polyarticular (>5 joints) usually symmetric
- Initially may have too few joints to classify as RA so maybe ***undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis*** with high risk of RA progression in 
	- Higher number of tender or swollen joints 
	- RF positive
	- Anti CCP 
	- High physical disability scores 
- Wrist, MCP, PIP most common involved
- DIP maybe involved but usually implies coexistent [[Osteoarthritis]]
- Flexor tendon tenosynovitis
	- Hallmark
	- Reduced range of motion
	- Reduced grip strength
	- ***Trigger*** fingers
	- May cause tendon rupture
	- Flexor pollicis Longus most common 
- Deformities
	- ***Ulnar deviation***
		- Subluxation of MCP joint with subluxation of proximal phalanx to volar side of hand 
	- ***Swan neck*** 
		- Hyperextension of PIP with flexed DIP 
	- ***Boutonniere deformity***
		- Flexion of PIP with hyperextension of DIP 
	- ***Z line deformity***
		- Subluxation of first MCP with hyperextension of first IP joint 
	- ***Piano key movement of ulnar styloid***
		- Inflammation around ulnar styloid and tenosynovitis of extensor carpi ulnaris 
		- Subluxation of distal ulna 
- MTP in feet is early but later ***pes planovalgas or flat feet*** seen 
- Large joints in established disease (knees and shoulders) but asymptomatic for many years
- Atlantoaxial joint involvement (subluxation in <10%)
	- may cause compressive myelopathy
	- neurological symptoms rarely a presenting sign 
	- May evolve over time with instability of C1 on C2 
- Extraarticular symptoms
	- 40% 
	- Some prior to onset of arthritis
	- More in
		- Cigarette smoke
		- Early onset of physical disability
		- RF or ACPA positive

## Constitutional
- weight lose
- Fatigue
- Fever 
- Malaise
- Depression
- Cachexia in severe cases 
- if fever > 101 ***suspect systemic vasculitis*** or infection
## nodules 
- 30-40% 
- More in 
	- High disease activity
	- Disease related shared epitope (SE)
	- RF positive
	- Joint erosion on radiology
- Declining trend due to aggressive therapy
- Palpation
	- Firm 
	- Non tender 
	- Adherent to periosteum, tendons or bursae 
	- Areas with frequent trauma or irritations like forearm, sacral prominence and Achilles tendon 
- Also in 
	- Lungs 
	- Pleura 
	- Pericardium
	- Peritoneum
- benign
- Maybe associated with infection ulceration or gangrene
- Accelerated growth maybe seen if taking methotrexate
## Sjogrens syndrome
- secondary Sjogrens is presence of ***Keratoconjunctivitis sicca or xerostomia with another connective tissue disease like RA*** 
- 10% 
## pulmonary
- pleuritis
	- Most common Pulmonary manifestation
	- Pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea
	- Friction rub and effusion
- Effusion
	- Exudative
	- Monocytes and neutrophil
- ILD (12% but 3.5% have before arthritis)
	- Dry cough and shortness of breath
	- Progressive
	- Cigarette smoking and higher disease activity
	- HRCT shows infiltrative opacification or ***Ground glass opacities*** in periphery of both lungs

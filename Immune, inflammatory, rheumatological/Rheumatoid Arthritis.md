- chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology
- Symmetric polyarthritis
- Most common form of chronic inflammatory arthritis
# Clinical features
- incidence max 25-55 years , plateau till 75 then decline
- Symptoms due to Inflammation of joint tendon bursae 
- Early morning stiffness >1hour easing with physical activity
- Earliest small joints of hand and feet 
- Initial maybe monoarticular, oligoarticular (<4 joints) or polyarticular (>5 joints) usually symmetric
- Initially may have too few joints to classify as RA so maybe ***undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis*** with high risk of RA progression in 
	- Higher number of tender or swollen joints 
	- RF positive
	- Anti CCP 
	- High physical disability scores 
- Wrist, MCP, PIP most common involved
- DIP maybe involved but usually implies coexistent [[Osteoarthritis]]
- Flexor tendon tenosynovitis
	- Hallmark
	- Reduced range of motion
	- Reduced grip strength
	- ***Trigger*** fingers
	- May cause tendon rupture
	- Flexor pollicis Longus most common 
- Deformities
	- ***Ulnar deviation***
		- Subluxation of MCP joint with subluxation of proximal phalanx to volar side of hand 
	- ***Swan neck*** 
		- Hyperextension of PIP with flexed DIP 
	- ***Boutonniere deformity***
		- Flexion of PIP with hyperextension of DIP 
	- ***Z line deformity***
		- Subluxation of first MCP with hyperextension of first IP joint 
	- ***Piano key movement of ulnar styloid***
		- Inflammation around ulnar styloid and tenosynovitis of extensor carpi ulnaris 
		- Subluxation of distal ulna 
- MTP in feet is early but later ***pes planovalgas or flat feet*** seen 
- Large joints in established disease (knees and shoulders) but asymptomatic for many years
- Atlantoaxial joint involvement (subluxation in <10%)
	- may cause compressive myelopathy
	- neurological symptoms rarely a presenting sign 
	- May evolve over time with instability of C1 on C2 
- Extraarticular symptoms
	- 40% 
	- Some prior to onset of arthritis
	- More in
		- Cigarette smoke
		- Early onset of physical disability
		- RF or ACPA positive
	- ![[RAExtraarticular.PNG]]
## Constitutional
- weight lose
- Fatigue
- Fever 
- Malaise
- Depression
- Cachexia in severe cases 
- if fever > 101 ***suspect systemic vasculitis*** or infection
## nodules 
- 30-40% 
- More in 
	- High disease activity
	- Disease related shared epitope (SE)
	- RF positive
	- Joint erosion on radiology
- Declining trend due to aggressive therapy
- Palpation
	- Firm 
	- Non tender 
	- Adherent to periosteum, tendons or bursae 
	- Areas with frequent trauma or irritations like forearm, sacral prominence and Achilles tendon 
- Also in 
	- Lungs 
	- Pleura 
	- Pericardium
	- Peritoneum
- benign
- Maybe associated with infection ulceration or gangrene
- Accelerated growth maybe seen if taking methotrexate
## Sjogrens syndrome
- secondary Sjogrens is presence of ***Keratoconjunctivitis sicca or xerostomia with another connective tissue disease like RA*** 
- 10% 
## pulmonary
- pleuritis
	- Most common Pulmonary manifestation
	- Pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea
	- Friction rub and effusion
- Effusion
	- Exudative
	- Monocytes and neutrophil
- ILD (12% but 3.5% have before arthritis)
	- Dry cough and shortness of breath
	- Progressive
	- Cigarette smoking and higher disease activity
	- HRCT shows infiltrative opacification or ***Ground glass opacities*** in periphery of both lungs 
	- UIP - progressive scarring showing honeycomb on HRCT in periphery and lower portion
	- NSIP relatively symmetric bilateral GGOs with fine reticulation and traction [[Bronchiectasis]] and volume loss 
	- Restrictive pattern with reduced DLCO 
	- Poor prognosis
	- Responds to immunosuppression
- Pulmonary nodules maybe solitary or multiple
- Caplans syndrome
	- Rare 
	- Nodules with pneumoconiosis on silica exposure
- Respiratory bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis very rarely
## Cardiac 
- pericardium most common (upto 50% on echo or autopsy)
- Symptomatic in <10% 
- Upto 20% have asymptomatic pericardial effusion
- Cardiomyopathy
	- Necrotising or granulomatous myocarditis
	- Coronary artery disease
	- Diastolic dysfunction
	- Subclinical only on echo or Cardiac MRI
- Rarely rheumatoid nodules or amyloid in muscle 
- MR most common valvular anomaly
## Vasculitis
- more in 
	- Long-standing disease
	- RF positive
	- Anti CCP positive
	- Hypocomplementemia 
- <1% 
- Cutaneous
	- Petechiae
	- Purpura
	- Digir infarct
	- Livedo reticularis 
	- Large painful lower extremity ulcers 
- Vasculitic ulcers treated with immunosuppression and skin grafting
- Mononeuritis multiplex 
	- Numbness
	- Tingling
	- Focal muscle weakness
## Hematologic
- Normocytic normoschromic Anemia most common
- Anemia parallel inflammation and correlates with ESR And CRP levels 
- Platelet counts raised as acute phase reactants 
- Thrombocytopenia rare 
- Feltys 
	- Neutropenia, splenomegaly, nodular RA 
	- Less than 1% 
	- Declining due to therapy
	- Late in severe RA 
	- Differential is T-LGL
		- T cell large granular lymphocyte leukaemia 
		- Associated with RA 
		- Chronic indolent clonal growth of LGL cells causing neutropenia and splenomegaly 
		- Early in RA (feltys late)
- Leukopenia uncommon
## Lymphoma
- 2-4x higher risk 
- DLBCL most common
- Higher risk if high disease activity or feltys syndrome
## Associated conditions
- Cardiovascular disease
	- Most common cause of death 
	- Higher incidence of CAD and carotid atherosclerosis 
	- CHF at 2x higher rates

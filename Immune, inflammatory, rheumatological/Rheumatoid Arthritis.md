- chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology
- Symmetric polyarthritis
- Most common form of chronic inflammatory arthritis
# Clinical features
- incidence max 25-55 years , plateau till 75 then decline
- Symptoms due to Inflammation of joint tendon bursae 
- Early morning stiffness >1hour easing with physical activity
- Earliest small joints of hand and feet 
- Initial maybe monoarticular, oligoarticular (<4 joints) or polyarticular (>5 joints) usually symmetric

# Pathology
- Affects synovial tissue of primarily diarthrodial joints with underlying cartilage and bone 
- Synovium
	- thin sheath 
	- Faces bone and cartilage and attached to periosteal region 
	- Type A synoviocytes (macrophage derived) 
	- Type B synoviocytes (fibroblasts derived)
		- more common
		- Structural components like collagen fibronectin and laminin produced
	- Sublining of blood vessels and mononuclear cell with loose connective tissue 
	- Synovial fluid is ultrafiltrate of blood and has hyaluronan and lubricin 
- Pathologic hallmark
	- Synovial inflammation and proliferation 
	- Focal bone erosion
	- Thinning of articular cartilage
- Synovial lining hyperplasia
- ***pannus*** formation
	- thickened cellular membrane
	- multiple layers of fibroblasts like synoviocytes and granulation reactive fibrovascular tissue 
	- Invades underlying cartilage and bone 
	- Infiltrate has 6 cells 
		- T cells 30-50% 
		- B cells 
		- Plasma cells
		- Dendritic cell
		- Mast cells
		- Granulocyte
	- Lymphos are diffusely organised 
	- May form lymphoid follicles and germinal centre like structures (B, T and dendritic cells)
- Structural damage mediated by osteoclast
	- Multinucleated giant cells 
	- CD 68, TRAP (tartrate resistant phosphatase) , cathepsin K and calcitonin receptor positive 
	- At pannus-bone interface form ***resorption lacunae*** 
	- Lacunae at insertion site of synovial membrane to periosteal surface 
	- At insertion site of ligament and tendon sheath 
	- ***MCP radial site more common*** as insertion of ligament, tendon and synovial membrane
- ***Periarticular osteopenia*** in active inflammation 
	- due to **marrow cavity inflammation** of trabeculae along metaphysis  
	- Seen on MRI as water rich with low fat 
	- Precede bony lesions 
- Endosteal bone absorption occurs  
- Generalised osteoporosis
- Articular cartilage
	- 4 layers (superficial, middle, deep and calcified cartilage) 
	- Avascular
	- Highly responsive to inflammation and mechanical factors
	- Matrix has ***generalised loss of proteoglycans*** in RA
# Pathogenesis
- Preclinical stage
	- Breakdown of self tolerance
	- RF and ACPA positive years before clinical disease
	- ACPA and RF roles speculative
- ACPA
	- directed to Deaminated peptides
	- Posttranslational modification by PAD14 
	- Recognise citrulline containing area of protein
	- Like 
		- Filaggrin 
		- Keratin 
		- Fibrinogen
		- Vimentin
- Other antibodies
	- Type 2 Collagen
	- Human cartilage gp39 
	- Aggrecan 
	- Calpastatin 
	- Immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP)
	- Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
- Long term smoking induces higher citrullination of protein by PAD1 in lung 
- TLR2 (lipoprotein), TLR 3 (dsRNA virus) TLR 4 (heat shock proteins) expressed in synovium in early RA and activation may induce inflammation
- Self-reactive T cells drive the chronic inflammatory response

	- Glucocorticoids use and immobility contribute
	- Hip fracture more common and increase disability and mortality
# Pathology
- Affects synovial tissue of primarily diarthrodial joints with underlying cartilage and bone 
- Synovium
	- thin sheath 
	- Faces bone and cartilage and attached to periosteal region 
	- Type A synoviocytes (macrophage derived) 
	- Type B synoviocytes (fibroblasts derived)
		- more common
		- Structural components like collagen fibronectin and laminin produced
	- Sublining of blood vessels and mononuclear cell with loose connective tissue 
	- Synovial fluid is ultrafiltrate of blood and has hyaluronan and lubricin 
- Pathologic hallmark
	- Synovial inflammation and proliferation 
	- Focal bone erosion
	- Thinning of articular cartilage
- Synovial lining hyperplasia
- ***pannus*** formation
	- thickened cellular membrane
	- multiple layers of fibroblasts like synoviocytes and granulation reactive fibrovascular tissue 
	- Invades underlying cartilage and bone 
	- Infiltrate has 6 cells 
		- T cells 30-50% 
		- B cells 
		- Plasma cells
		- Dendritic cell
		- Mast cells
		- Granulocyte
	- Lymphos are diffusely organised 
	- May form lymphoid follicles and germinal centre like structures (B, T and dendritic cells)
- Structural damage mediated by osteoclast
	- Multinucleated giant cells 
	- CD 68, TRAP (tartrate resistant phosphatase) , cathepsin K and calcitonin receptor positive 
	- At pannus-bone interface form ***resorption lacunae*** 
	- Lacunae at insertion site of synovial membrane to periosteal surface 
	- At insertion site of ligament and tendon sheath 
	- ***MCP radial site more common*** as insertion of ligament, tendon and synovial membrane
- ***Periarticular osteopenia*** in active inflammation 
	- due to **marrow cavity inflammation** of trabeculae along metaphysis  
	- Seen on MRI as water rich with low fat 
	- Precede bony lesions 
- Endosteal bone absorption occurs  
- Generalised osteoporosis
- Articular cartilage
	- 4 layers (superficial, middle, deep and calcified cartilage) 
	- Avascular
	- Highly responsive to inflammation and mechanical factors
	- Matrix has ***generalised loss of proteoglycans*** in RA
# Pathogenesis
- Preclinical stage
	- Breakdown of self tolerance
	- RF and ACPA positive years before clinical disease
	- ACPA and RF roles speculative
- ACPA
	- directed to Deaminated peptides
	- Posttranslational modification by PAD14 
	- Recognise citrulline containing area of protein
	- Like 
		- Filaggrin 
		- Keratin 
		- Fibrinogen
		- Vimentin
- Other antibodies
	- Type 2 Collagen
	- Human cartilage gp39 
	- Aggrecan 
	- Calpastatin 
	- Immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP)
	- Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
- Long term smoking induces higher citrullination of protein by PAD1 in lung 
- TLR2 (lipoprotein), TLR 3 (dsRNA virus) TLR 4 (heat shock proteins) expressed in synovium in early RA and activation may induce inflammation
- Self-reactive T cells drive the chronic inflammatory response
- Mechanism of self reactive 
	- Abnormal thymic selection
	- Intrinsic defect lowering threshold of activation of T cells 
- CD 4 T cells involved mainly
	- SE on MHC 2 is a risk factor 
	- Memory T cells enriched in synovium and implicated by ***guilt through association*** 
- CD 4 T cell activation by 
	- T cell receptor binding to peptide-MHC on APCs 
	- CD28 Binding to CD 80/86 on APCs 
	- IL 17 promote joint inflammation 
- Complete from Harrison
# Diagnosis
- Signs and symptoms of chronic inflammatory arthritis with labs and radiology to corroborate
- ![[RAclassification.PNG]]
- If score atleast 6/10 then RA 
- Earlier >6 weeks symptoms required but not now 
- ACPA now include which is more specific for RA 
- These are classification criteria and not diagnostic criteria which tell of high likelihood of transition to chronic disease 
- Differential
	- all acute and chronic inflammatory arthritis
	- Sjogrens primary maybe confused as may have joint involvement
	- Spondyloarthropathies have sacroiliitis and other enthesopathic symptoms with symptoms of psoriasis or IBD 
	- Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) in elderly but RA has wrists hands ankle feet involvement 
	- RS3PE (remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema) has pitting edema not seen in RA plus quick response to steroid (low dose Prednisone) 
# Laboratory features
- Elevated non-specific markers like ESR CRP 
- RF and ACPA but RF has low sensitivity
- IgM IgG IgA RF are seen in disease but labs measure only IgM (seen in 75%) so negative does not exclude
- RF in 
	- Primary Sjogrens
	- SLE 
	- Type 2 mixed essential cryoglobulinemia
	- SABE 
	- Hep B and C 
- ACPA has same sensitivity but 95% specificity and positive also associated with worse outcome 
- 30% have ANAs and some have ANCA (particular pANCA) 
- Synovial fluid analysis
	- Acute inflammatory type 
	- WBC 5000-50000 (<2000 non inflammatory)
	- neutrophil 
	- Confirms inflammatory 
	- Exclude infection or crystal induced 
## Joint imaging
- progression and diagnosis both
- X-ray common but limited to bone and joint space 
- MRI and USG have better soft tissue sensitivity
- ***Musculoskeletal USG with power Doppler*** for synovitis and bone erosion
- Plain radiographs
	- Initial periarticular osteopenia but difficult to read 
	- Soft tissue swelling, symmetric joint space loss and subchondral erosion in MCP MTP PIP
	- severe disease shows joint subluxation and collapse
- MRI
	- Greatest sensitivity for synovitis and effusion
	- Early bone and marrow changes
	- Bone marrow edema early marker and predicts development of erosions 
- Ultrasound
	- More erosion than x-ray in accessible joints 
	- Synovitis and increased vascularity of joint 
# Clinical course
- Affected by age, gender, phenotype, comorbidities
- Heterogeneous condition
- 10% with classification criteria will have spontaneous remission in 6 months
- Majority have persistent progressive waxing waning disease
- Minority have intermittent explosive recurring attacks with period of quiescence 
- Aggressive form in few with progression of joint erosions 
- Disability assessed by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) 
- Disability in early disease due to joint inflammation and later it is joint damage 
- Mortality 2x general population 
- Ischemic heart disease most common cause 
# Treatment
- Several scores to assess disease activity clinically
- ACR 20, 50, 70 improvement criteria
	- 20,50,70 % improvement 
	- Joint counts, pain scale , ESR CRP, physician/patient assessment of disease severity and functional assessment of disability
	- Used in trials for response to therapy
- Clinical scores 
	- Disease Activity Score (DAS)
	- Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) 
	- Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 
	- ROUTINE Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3)
- Development over 20 years 
	- Methotrexate is DMARD of choice in early RA 
	- Novel biologicals developed
	- DMARD regimes superior over methotrexate alone 
## NSAIDs 
- Earlier core of therapy
- Now adjunct in symptomatic management if uncontrolled 
- Both analgesic and anti-inflammatory 
- Minimise chronic use 
## Glucocorticoids
- Low to moderate doses for rapid control before DMARD can act which takes weeks to months 
- 1-2 week burst for flair 
- Chronic low dose (5-10mg daily) of Prednisone for inadequate response to DMARD therapy 
- Avoid chronic use and look for DMARD
- High dose maybe needed in extraarticular symptoms like ILD 
- Intraarticular triamcinolone acetate for inflamed joints (exclude infection first)
- Maybe associated with osteoporosis long-term so bisphosphonate therapy maybe warranted 
- Teriparatide and denosumab also approved for osteoporosis
## DMARDs 
- Slow or prevent progression 
- HCQ, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide conventional with delayed action upto 6-12 weeks 
- Methotrexate
	- Approved since 1988 
	- DMARD of choice
	- Stimulates adenosine release which has anti-inflammatory effects
	- Weekly by oral or subcutaneous route 
	- Folic acid cotherapy to prevent side effects
- Leflunomide inhibits pyrimidine synthesis and has similar action to methotrexate
- Hydroxychloroquine not a true DMARD as doesn't delay radiological progression
	- In early mild or as adjunct to others 
	- 5mg/kg or lower to reduce renal toxicity
- Minocycline, gold, penicillamine, azathioprine, cyclosporine have varying results
## Biologicals
- Protein therapeutic to target cytokines and cell surface molecules
- Anti-TNF 
	- First agents 
	- 5 currently
		- Infliximab (chimeric monoclonal)
		- Adalimumab (humanized)
		- Golimumab (humanized)

- multisystem disease due to autoimmune reaction to gp A streptococcus
- Almost all manifestation resolve with treatment **except cardiac valvular damage**
# Global 
# Epidemiology
- children age 5-14 mainly
- Initial episode less common in older adolescent and young adults but very rare in >30 years
- Recurrent episodes of ARF common in adolescents and young adults
- RHD peaks between 25-40 years age 
- RHD female:male 2:1 but no clear for ARD 
# Pathogenesis
- ![[ARFpathogenesis.PNG]]
## Organisms
- Classically only caused by URTI by gp A streptococcus (M type 1,3,5,6,14,18,19,24,27,29)
- Recently many more serotypes associated
- "Rheumatic Motifs" found in only a few serotypes
- Clear role of skin infection also 
- +/- role of gp C, G streptococcus
## Host factors
- 3-6% population susceptible
- Familial clustering of cases and concordance in monozygotic twins -- suggests **susceptibility is inherited characteristic** 
- HLADR7 HLA-DR4 associated with susceptibility
- HLA DR5, HLA-DR6 HLA-DR51 , HLA-DR52 HLA-DQ protective 
- Associated with TNF-Alpha, high levels of Mannose binding lectins, TLRs 
## Immune Response
- molecular mimicry is most commonly accepted 
- Immune response targeted at streptococcal antigens -- M protein  and N-acetylglucosamine of gp A streptococcus carbohydrate , also targets human tissue
- Cross-reactive antibodies bind to endothelial cells on heart valves -- Activate VCAM-1 -- activated lymphocytes recruited + complement --- and lysis of endothelial cells
- Complement rekeases

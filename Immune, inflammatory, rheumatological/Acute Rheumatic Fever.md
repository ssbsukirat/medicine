- multisystem disease due to autoimmune reaction to gp A streptococcus
- Almost all manifestation resolve with treatment **except cardiac valvular damage**
# Global 
# Epidemiology
- children age 5-14 mainly
- Initial episode less common in older adolescent and young adults but very rare in >30 years
- Recurrent episodes of ARF common in adolescents and young adults
- RHD peaks between 25-40 years age 
- RHD female:male 2:1 but no clear for ARD 
# Pathogenesis
- ![[ARFpathogenesis.PNG]]
## Organisms
- Classically only caused by URTI by gp A streptococcus (M type 1,3,5,6,14,18,19,24,27,29)
- Recently many more serotypes associated
- "Rheumatic Motifs" found in only a few serotypes
- Clear role of skin infection also 
- +/- role of gp C, G streptococcus
## Host factors
- 3-6% population susceptible
- Familial clustering of cases and concordance in monozygotic twins -- suggests **susceptibility is inherited characteristic** 
- HLADR7 HLA-DR4 associated with susceptibility
- HLA DR5, HLA-DR6 HLA-DR51 , HLA-DR52 HLA-DQ protective 
- Associated with TNF-Alpha, high levels of Mannose binding lectins, TLRs 
## Immune Response
- molecular mimicry is most commonly accepted 
- Immune response targeted at streptococcal antigens -- M protein  and N-acetylglucosamine of gp A streptococcus carbohydrate , also targets human tissue
- Cross-reactive antibodies bind to endothelial cells on heart valves -- Activate VCAM-1 -- activated lymphocytes recruited + complement --- and lysis of endothelial cells
- Complement releases peptides like laminin, keratin and tropomyosin -- cross-reactive T cells activated -- invade heart -- amplify damage and cause epitope spreading
- Alternative -- streptococcal invasion of epithelial surface -- M protein binding to type 4 collagen -- becomes immunogenic

# Clinical
- latency or 3 weeks (1-5 weeks) between GAS infection and feature of ARF 
- Chorea and indolent carditis may present after 6 months as well 
- Mostly GAS is subclinical though some may have a sore throat -- confirm by streptococcal antibody testing 
- Polyarthritis (60-75%) and carditis (50-75% ) most common 
- Chorea 2-30% 
- Erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules rare <5% cases 
## Heart 
- 75% of ARF progress to RHD 
- Valvular damage is hallmark of Rheumatic carditis
- Mitral valve almost always involved +/- aortic 
- Isolated aortic valve involvement rare 
- Pulmonary or tricuspid valve damage usually secondary to increased pulmonary pressure due to left sided disease 
- Acute is usually regurgitation
- later over years stenosis due to 
    - leaflet thickening
    - Scarring
    - Calcification
- Mitral regurgitation sometime with aortic regurgitation is characteristic
- PR prolongation and softening of first heart sound due to electric pathway defects due to myocardial inflammation

## Joints 
- most common is Arthritis (hot swollen inflammation joint red and tender)
- Migratory polyarthritis typical
- Large joint usually - knee, ankles, hip, elbows 
- Assymetrical
- Arthralgia with migratory pattern 
- Aseptic monoarthritis maybe presenting feature in some cases
- Highly responsive to salicylate and NSAIDs
- If no response to NSAIDs in 1-2 days then unlikely ARF 
## Sydenham Chorea 
- in absence of other features, prolonged latency to onset, more in females

# Definition 
- Joint failure , a disease where all structure of joint have undergone pathological change, often in concert 
- pathological sine qua non is ***hyaline cartilage loss, FOCAL and initially NON-UNIFORM*** 
- increased thickness and sclerosis of subchondral bony plate by 
	- osteophyte outgrowth at joint margin 
	- stretching of capsules 
	- synovitis variable 
	- weakness of bridging muscles of joint 
- meniscal degeneration in knees 
- pathway is major joint injury in absence of protective mechanism 
# Protective measure and failure 
- joint capsule and ligaments 
	- limit excursion 
	- fix range of motion 
- muscle, sensory afferent and bone 
	- muscle absorbs focal stress before impact preventing injury 
- synovial fluid 
	- reduces friction in articulating cartilage surface 
	- protects from friction induced wear 
	- ***hyaluronic acid and lubricin involved*** 
	- lubricin is mucinous glycoprotein, reduces after injury and inflammation 
- mechanoreceptor sensory nerves  
	- ligamens, skin tendons 
	- different frequency at different range of motion 
	- feedback through spinal cord 
	- anticipated joint loading and prevent excursions 
##  Cartilage 
- joint protector 
- lubricated by synovial fluid almost frictionless surface 
- earliest changes of OA in cartilage 
- Macromolecules 
	- ***Type 2 collagen*** 
		- tensile strength 
	- ***Aggrecan*** 
		- proteoglycan linked to hyaluronic acid 
		- highly negative glucosaminoglycans 
	- type 2 woven tight , constrains aggrecan , fixing negative charge in close proximity 
	- ***repulsion of negative charges give cartilage compressive stiffness*** 
- Chondrocytes 
	- cells in avascular tissue 
	- synthesise all elements of matrix and enzymes of breakdown 
	- balance between matrix synthesis and breakdown is dynamic and influenced by cytokines and growth factor 
	- MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases ) and ADAMTS-5 for breakdown 

- Local inflammation 
	- accelerates development and progress of OA 
	- if present more likely OA joint is painful 
	- some induced by mechanical stimuli (***Mechanoinflammation***)
	- Matrix component from cartilage cause ***Synovitis*** 
	- IL-1B and TNF-Î± induce PG-E2 and NO from chondrocytes 
	- early inflammation may cause matrix synthesis but net matrix degradation by cytokines 
	- enzymes held in check by activation inhibitors like ***TIMP (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases )*** 
	- Growth factors like BMP-2 (Bone morphogenic protein ) and TGF-Beta stimulate osteophytes 
	- healthy cartilage is avascular due to angiogenesis inhibitors but OA has ***vascular invasion*** from bone due to VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor )
	- angiogenesis causes nerve growth which have nociceptor innervation
- With aging, matrix synthesis decreased but proinflammatory mediators and matrix degrade (***Senescent secretory phenotype*** )
- Aging cartilage less resistant to injury 
- Gradual depletion of Aggrecan with age, unfurling of matrix and loss of type 2 collagen 
# Risk Factors 
- Joint vulnerability and Loading major factors 
- old joint vulnerable with small injury 
- young joint with intact defences requires major acute injury or long-term overloading to precipitate OA 
## Systemic factors 
- Age 
	- Dynamic loading increase matrix synthesis in young but dimnished in elderly 
	- cartilage thins with age and has higher Shear stress and risk of damage 
	- protectors fail more with age 
	- muscles weaker and slow to respond 
	- sensory loops slow with age 
	- ligaments stretch so make it less able to absorb 
- women due to maybe hormone loss but unclear why 
## Heritable and genetics 
- joint specific heritability 
- hand and hip 50% is heritable 
- "generalised OA" age related not inheritable 
- GDF5 (growth differentiation factor 5) polymorphism involved (by altering joint shape)
## Joint environment 
- local 
- uneven distribution of loading forces due to change in anatomy 
- Hip congenital conditions leading to OA later in life 
	- congenital dysplasia 
	- Legg-Perthes disease 
	- Slipped capital femoral epiphysis 
- Femoroacetabular impingement
	- adolescent 
	- outgrowth of bone at femoral head/neck junction 
	- during bone plate closure 
	- abnormal contact during flexion and rotation 
	- increase OA risk 
- Major injury 
	- fracture through surface 
	- avascular necrosis 
- Ligament or fibrocartilage tear (menisci or hip labrum) cause premature OA 
- Framingham Study subjects, men with a history of major knee injury, but no surgery, had a 3.5-fold increased risk for subsequent knee OA 
- Malalignment 
	- best studied in knee 
	- Varus (bowlegged) knees have medial cartilage loss 
	- Valgus (knock-kneed) have lateral cartilage loss 
	- severe focal stress 
	- marrow lesions in MRI 
	- if severe progress despite other factors 
- weakness of quadriceps 
## loading factors 
- Obesity 
	- 3x-6x force in knee in single leg position 
	- more in obesity 
	- knee> hip OA 
	- precedes OA but maybe consequence due to inactivity
	- women > men 
	- weight loss decreases risk 
	- more pain in obese 
- Repeated joint use 
	- Occupational vs leisure activity 
	- workers in jobs have higher risk 
	- farmers ***hip OA*** 
	- miner ***knee and spine OA*** 
	- lifting or carrying or bending jobs have ***Knee OA***
	- muscles exhausted so dont protect 
	- ***no associated OA with exercise*** 
	- in prior injury , exercise may increase risk 
	- elite runners more risk than nonrunners 
# Pathology 
- many joint structure involved 
- cartilage 
	- initially ***surface fibrillation and irregularity***
	- ***focal erosions spreading to subjacent bone*** with progress 
	- erosion down to bone and larger proportion of joint surface 
- Post injury mitosis and clustering in chondrocytes 
	- high metabolic activity 
	- promote ***proteoglycan depletion*** in matrix
	- matrix damage , exposure of negative charges, swelling of cartilage 
	- apoptosis of basal chondrocytes 
- Bone alteration 
	- subchondral 
	- due to cartilage loss 
	- osteoclast and osteoblast activation due to growth factors and cytokines 
	- thickening of subchondral plate even before cartilage ulceration 
	- trauma during loading causes this 
	- healing from injury or microcracks inducing remodeling 
	- osteonecrosis may occur in advance disease 
	- bone death due to cutoff vascular supply with shearing of microvasculature 
- ***Osteophyte*** 
	- margin of joint 
	- near point of cartilage loss 
	- outgrowth of new cartilage 
	- with neurovascular invasion , ossification 
	- radiological hallmark 
- Synovium 
	- lubricating fluids 
	- macrophage and fibroblast with fat in a single discontinous layer normally 
	- edematous and inflamed in OA 
	- macrophage migration from periphery to tissue with proliferation of cells lining synovium 
	- capsule stretches, edematous , fibrotic 
- pathology different across joints 
	- hand OA has erosion of cartilage in center of joint, probably from bony pressure from opposite side of joint 
- basic calcium phosphate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals microscopy in end-stage OA 
# Source of pain 
- cartilage is aneural, so loss alone is not causative of pain 
- pain likely from structures outside 
- Innervated structure 
	- synovium
	- ligaments 
	- joint capsules 
	- muscle 
	- subchondral bone 
- x-ray poor correlation with pain 
- source 
	- synovial inflammation 
		- correlates with pain presence and severity 
		- on MRI 
	- joint effusion 
	- bone marrow edema 
		- MRI 
		- histologically has microcracks and scars 
- outside the joint sources 
	- bursae 
	- anserine bursitis 
	- iliotibial band syndrome 
- more pain when nociceptor stimulated during weight bearing activity 
- as progression, pain more constant and at rest 
	- ***Peripheral Sensitisation*** 
		- alteration in Peripheral nociceptor 
		- become more responsive to sensory input 
	- ***Central Sensitisation*** 
		- increased facilitated central nociceptor signalling 
	- ***insufficient descending inhibitory modulation*** 
	- nervous alterations cause ***Allodynia and hyperalgesia***
- obesity increase severity of pain 
# Clinical features 
- Pain 
	- activity related early on 
	- during or just after use 
	- early is episodic and triggered by overuse 
	- stiffness maybe present 
	- ***morning stiffness <30 min***
- Knees 
	- Buckling from weakness of muscles 
	- ***buckling , catching or locking from internal derangements also (ACL or miniscal tear)***
	- to be evaluated if after acute injury 
	- pain on flexion from ***patellofemoral*** component usually after 35 degree bending 
	- most common cause of chronic knee pain in >45 age but differential 
		- Inflammatory arthritis if prolonged morning stiffness and many joints involved 
		- Bursitis around hips knees 
		- Anserine bursitis medial and distal to knee responds to glucocorticoid injection 
		- nocturnal pain without end-stage OA needs workup 
- No blood tests routinely advised unless inflammatory arthritis suspected 
- Joint aspiration better than X-ray 
	- if WBC >1000/uL inflammatory or gout or pseudogout 
- X-ray or MRI not indicated in workup 
	- if pain and findings atypical for OA 
	- pain persistent after treatment for OA 
	- never change treatment based on MRI alone 
# Treatment 
- Goals 
	- alleviated pain 
	- minimise loss of physical function 
- multi-modal with physical and pharmacological 
- Mild and intermittent symptoms 
	- symptomatic management 
	- weight loss 
	- exercise 
	- physical activity 
	- self management 
- Ongoing disabling pain need physical and pharmacological 
## Physical management 
- alter loading and improve function of joint protectors
- reduce focal load 
	- avoid painful activity that overload joint 
	- strength and condition bridging muscles 
	- unload by brace or splint or cane or crutch 
- weight loss 
- splinting in Hand OA 
- weight bearing joints like knee or hip unload with ***cane in opposite hand*** 
### Exercise 
- Pain reduces activity leading to high risk of CVS mortality and obesity
- Aerobic capacity worse than others of same age 
- Muscle weakness multifactorial
	- Age related decline
	- Disuse muscle atrophy
	- Gait alterations to reduce loading of joint 
	- ***Arthrogenous inhibition*** where muscle contraction of joint is inhibited by afferent feedback loop emanating in swollen stretched capsule, preventing maximum strength attainment
- Weakness correlate to pain and degree of limitation
- Exercise improve pain and function
- Effective is aerobic with resistance training of muscles around joint 
- Avoid painful exercise and optimise for individual daily activities
- Range of motion exercise (do not strengthen) or isometric exercise (strengthen muscle but not through Range of motion) alone not useful
- Low impact like water aerobics and resistance better tolerated 
- No strong evidence for exercise in hand OA 
- Biggest problem is compliance
### Correct malalignment 
- In frontal plane (Varus-Valgus) malalignment causes increased stress 
- Correction of Varus-Valgus with braces or surgery relieved pain 
- Fitted braces are effective but 
	- Patients unwilling to wear 
	- Slip with use in obese legs making ineffective
- Shoes with rubber hemispheres on sole to alter alignment have some benefits
- Patellofemoral pain by 
	- Tilting of patella 
	- Malalignment with patella in femoral trochlear groove 
	- Relieve by ***patellar brace or taping*** 
	- Tape is difficult and irritable to skin 
- Neoprene sleeves over knee popular but unclear effect on

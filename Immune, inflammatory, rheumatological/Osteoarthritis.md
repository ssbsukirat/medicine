- most common arthritis 
- high prevalence in elderly and high negative impact on function especially in elderly 
- affected 
	- hip 
	- knee 
	- 1st MTP 
	- cervical and lumbosacral knee 
	- DIP PIP 
	- base of thumb 
- spared 
	- wrist 
	- elbow 
	- ankle 
- structural changes of OA are universal in elderly 
	- cartilage loss -- seen as joint space loss in xray 
	- osteophytes 
- symptoms more important than structural anomaly 
	- usually pain 
	- 12% patients  >60 age 
	- Hip OA 1/3 common as knee 
	- Hand 
		- radiographic OA and bony enlargement common 
		- pain rare in hand 
		- painful in 10% elderly 
		- limitation in function 
- uncommon <40 and very common >60 
- women > men 
# Definition 
- Joint failure , a disease where all structure of joint have undergone pathological change, often in concert 
- pathological sine qua non is ***hyaline cartilage loss, FOCAL and initially NON-UNIFORM*** 
- increased thickness and sclerosis of subchondral bony plate by 
	- osteophyte outgrowth at joint margin 
	- stretching of capsules 
	- synovitis variable 
	- weakness of bridging muscles of joint 
- meniscal degeneration in knees 
- pathway is major joint injury in absence of protective mechanism 
# Protective measure and failure 
- joint capsule and ligaments 
	- limit excursion 
	- fix range of motion 
- muscle, sensory afferent and bone 
- synovial fluid 
	- reduces friction in articulat

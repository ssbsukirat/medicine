# Definition 
- Joint failure , a disease where all structure of joint have undergone pathological change, often in concert 
- pathological sine qua non is ***hyaline cartilage loss, FOCAL and initially NON-UNIFORM*** 
- increased thickness and sclerosis of subchondral bony plate by 
	- osteophyte outgrowth at joint margin 
	- stretching of capsules 
	- synovitis variable 
	- weakness of bridging muscles of joint 
- meniscal degeneration in knees 
- pathway is major joint injury in absence of protective mechanism 
# Protective measure and failure 
- joint capsule and ligaments 
	- limit excursion 
	- fix range of motion 
- muscle, sensory afferent and bone 
	- muscle absorbs focal stress before impact preventing injury 
- synovial fluid 
	- reduces friction in articulating cartilage surface 
	- protects from friction induced wear 
	- ***hyaluronic acid and lubricin involved*** 
	- lubricin is mucinous glycoprotein, reduces after injury and inflammation 
- mechanoreceptor sensory nerves  
	- ligamens, skin tendons 
	- different frequency at different range of motion 
	- feedback through spinal cord 
	- anticipated joint loading and prevent excursions 
##  Cartilage 
- joint protector 
- lubricated by synovial fluid almost frictionless surface 
- earliest changes of OA in cartilage 
- Macromolecules 
	- ***Type 2 collagen*** 
		- tensile strength 
	- ***Aggrecan*** 
		- proteoglycan linked to hyaluronic acid 
		- highly negative glucosaminoglycans 
	- type 2 woven tight , constrains aggrecan , fixing negative charge in close proximity 
	- ***repulsion of negative charges give cartilage compressive stiffness*** 
- Chondrocytes 
	- cells in avascular tissue 
	- synthesise all elements of matrix and enzymes of breakdown 
	- balance between matrix synthesis and breakdown is dynamic and influenced by cytokines and growth factor 
	- MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases ) and ADAMTS-5 for breakdown 

- Local inflammation 
	- accelerates development and progress of OA 
	- if present more likely OA joint is painful 
	- some induced by mechanical stimuli (***Mechanoinflammation***)
	- Matrix component from cartilage cause ***Synovitis*** 
	- IL-1B and TNF-Î± induce PG-E2 and NO from chondrocytes 
	- early inflammation may cause matrix synthesis but net matrix degradation by cytokines 
	- enzymes held in check by activation inhibitors like ***TIMP (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases )*** 
	- Growth factors like BMP-2 (Bone morphogenic protein ) and TGF-Beta stimulate osteophytes 
	- healthy cartilage is avascular due to angiogenesis inhibitors but OA has ***vascular invasion*** from bone due to VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor )
	- angiogenesis causes nerve growth which have nociceptor innervation
- With aging, matrix synthesis decreased but proinflammatory mediators and matrix degrade (***Senescent secretory phenotype*** )
- Aging cartilage less resistant to injury 
- Gradual depletion of Aggrecan with age, unfurling of matrix and loss of type 2 collagen 
# Risk Factors 
- Joint vulnerability and Loading major factors 
- old joint vulnerable with small injury 
- young joint with intact defences requires major acute injury or long-term overloading to precipitate OA 
## Systemic factors 
- Age 
	- Dynamic loading increase matrix synthesis in young but dimnished in elderly 
	- cartilage thins with age and has higher Shear stress and risk of damage 
	- protectors fail more with age 
	- muscles weaker and slow to respond 
	- sensory loops slow with age 
	- ligaments stretch so make it less able to absorb 
- women due to maybe hormone loss but unclear why 
## Heritable and genetics 
- joint specific heritability 
- hand and hip 50% is heritable 
- "generalised OA" age related not inheritable 
- GDF5 (growth differentiation factor 5) polymorphism involved (by altering joint shape)
## Joint environment 
- local 
- uneven distribution of loading forces due to change in anatomy 
- Hip congenital conditions leading to OA later in life 
	- congenital dysplasia 
	- Legg-Perthes disease 
	- Slipped capital femoral epiphysis 
- Femoroacetabular impingement
	- adolescent 
	- outgrowth of bone at femoral head/neck junction 
	- during bone plate closure 
	- abnormal contact during flexion and rotation 
	- increase OA risk 
- Major injury 
	- fracture through surface 
	- avascular necrosis 
- Ligament or fibrocartilage tear (menisci or hip labrum) cause premature OA 
- Framingham Study subjects, men with a history of major knee injury, but no surgery, had a 3.5-fold increased risk for subsequent knee OA 
- Malalignment 
	- best studied in knee 
	- Varus (bowlegged) knees have medial cartilage loss 
	- Valgus (knock-kneed) have lateral cartilage loss 
	- severe focal stress 
	- marrow lesions in MRI 
	- if severe progress despite other factors 
- weakness of quadriceps 
## loading factors 
- Obesity 
	- 3x-6x force in knee in single leg position 
	- more in obesity 
	- knee> hip OA 
	- precedes OA but maybe consequence due to inactivity
	- women > men 
	- weight loss decreases risk 
	- more pain in obese 
- Repeated joint use 
	- Occupational vs leisure activity 
	- workers in jobs have higher risk 
	- farmers ***hip OA*** 
	- miner ***knee and spine OA*** 
	- lifting or carrying or bending jobs have ***Knee OA***

- manifesting as Parkinson’s disease and dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia, after Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
# Clinical
- PDD and DLB as points on a spectrum of LBD pathology
- severe executive, attentional, and visuospatial deficits but preserved episodic memory 
- Early psychosis including well-formed visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and parkinsonism are the main diagnostic features in DLB
- Delusions are less frequent than hallucinations 
- Fluctuating attention and concentration 
- Minor day-to-day variation in cognitive functioning is common across dementias, but in DLB these fluctuations can be marked
- first manifestation of DLB in some patients is delirium, often precipitated by an infection, new medicine, or other systemic disturbance
- patients with RBD enact dreams, often violently, leading to injuries to themselves or their bed partners.
- time interval between parkinsonism and dementia differentiate PDD and DLB. 
- PDD presents in patients with long-standing PD, who manifest dementia often with visual hallucinations, fluctuating attention or alertness, and RBD.
- On the other hand, when the dementia and the neuropsychiatric symptoms precede or co-emerge with the parkinsonism, the patient is diagnosed with DLB
- Orthostatic hypotension that can lead to syncopal events, erectile dysfunction, and constipation can be present early in DLB, at times making it challenging to differentiate DLB from multiple system atrophy (MSA
- MSA the autonomic disturbances occur early and are usually more severe than in DLB, and cognition is relatively preserved.
# prodromal phase
- patients have a mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with cognitive deficits that do not have a substantial impact on daily life.
- deficits in executive, attention, and visuospatial disturbances, but can also present with an amnestic or multiple-domain MCI 
- challenging to differentiate prodromal MCI-DLB and PD-MCI when the major features are RBD and parkinsonism, for which the term prodromal MCI-Lewy body (MCI-LB) was recently proposed.
# pathology 
- presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites throughout specific brainstem nuclei, substantia nigra, amygdala, cingulate gyrus, and, ultimately, the neocortex.
- Lewy bodies
    - intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions
    - stain with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) and ubiquitin 
    - identified with antibodies to the presynaptic protein α-synuclein
    - composed of straight neurofilaments 7–20 nm long with surrounding amorphous material
    - contain epitopes recognized by antibodies against phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated neurofilament proteins, ubiquitin, and α-synuclein
- presence of α-synuclein a gates in neurons and glia in PDD and DLB molecularly classifies these diseases as synucleinopathies
- Stages of progression 
    - Brainstem predominant;
    - transitional limbic;
    - diffuse neocortical
- LBD may similarly propagate via a prion-like mechanism 
- pathologic propagation from the periphery to the brain correlates with the evolution of clinical symptoms; PD usually manifests first with nonmotor features characterized by constipation and/or hyposmia, followed by anxiety, depression, RBD, parkinsonism, and lastly dementia. PDD is manifested clinically when limbic and cortical areas are involved
- cholinergic deficit, owing to basal forebrain and p culopontine nucleus involvement, is present in most patients with DLB
# Pathogenesis
- Both genes and environmental factors are thought to contribute
- mutations of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) particularly lead to PDD or DLB presentations
- origins of LBD in gastrointestinal and olfactory areas suggest that environmental toxins acting on a susceptible genetic background may contribute to the LBD pathogenesis (a “double-hit” hypothesis)
# Labs
- rule out treatable causes of dementia such as drugs, infections, or metabolic disturbances 
- MRI of the brain can be helpful to rule out vascular parkinsonism or subdural hematomas, or support the diagnosis of other disorders such as MSA 
- Biomarkers 
    - polysomnogram showing RBD with atonia, 
    - CSF showing either α-synuclein oligomers (RT-QuIC)
    - CSF or blood levels of phospho-tau217, 
    - iodine-123-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac scintigraphy showing cardiac postganglionic sympathetic denervation, 
    - dopamine transporter imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET)
# Treatment 
- several symptomatic treatments are available. 
- cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine (target dose 6 mg twice daily or 9.5 mg patch daily) or donepezil (target dose 10 mg daily) often improve cognition, reduce hallucinosis, and stabilize delusional symptoms
- atypical antipsychotic pimavanserin is frequently helpful to treat the psychosis and does not worsen parkinsonism
- Pimavanserin is a selective inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor that does not block dopamine receptors
- Low-dose clozapine (begin at 6.25 mg, increasing up to 25 mg, daily) is also effective for treating hallucinations and delusions 
- should not be exposed to typical neuroleptics that can lead to a neuroleptic malignant syndrome and death
- RBD usually responds to melatonin, requiring at times 20 mg/ day.
- clonazepam, gabapentin, or codeine if melatonin fails 
- Antidepressants, especially those with strong anxiolytic properties (escitalopram, paroxetine, duloxetine, or venlafaxine) are often necessary for mood and anxiety symptoms

# Hyperkinetic movement Disorders
- involuntary movements accompanied by weakness
- Arbitrary and misleading sometimes as even Parkinson's patients may have tremors (Hyperkinetic feature) or dystonia (Hyperkinetic disorder) may have slow or restricted movements due to muscle contractions 
# Tremor
## Clinical features
- involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part with alternating contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles 
- Most prominent on 
    - rest -- resting tremor
    - Assuming posture -- postural tremor 
    - Actively reaching for target -- kinetic tremor
    - Carrying out a movement -- action Tremor 
- also characterised by distribution, frequency, amplitude and related neurological dysfunction
- Along 2 axes 
    - Axis 1 -- clinical characteristics like
        - history (age, family history, temporal evolution)
        - Tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition)
        - Associated sign (systeic, neurological)
        - Laboratory findings (electrophysiology, imaging)
    - Axis 2 -- etiology 
        - acquired vs genetic vs idiopathic
- PD tremor 
    - predominant **resting tremor**
    - essential tremor (ET) Characterized by a tremor occuring while trying to sustain a posture coupled with action Tremor 
    - Cerebellar dysfunction characterized by ***kinetic tremor*** (when trying to reach an object)
- Physiological tremor 
    - normal individuals
    - Mild high frequency (10-12hz) postural or action Tremor 
    - Typically in upper extremities
    - Appreciated only with accelerometer or under stress 
- Enhanced physiological tremor
    - in 10% 
    - Associated with anxiety, fatigue, metabolic disturbance (hyperthyroidism, electrolyte abnormalities) or drugs (valproate, lithium) or toxins (caffeine, smoking, alcohol)
    - Treat by control of underlying disorder
    - Improve with beta blockers
## Essential Tremors
- most common movement Disorder 
- May occur in childhood by

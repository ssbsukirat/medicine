# Parkinson's Disease Overview

- **Second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease**, after Alzheimer's disease (AD).
- Cardinal clinical features described by **James Parkinson in 1817**.
- Estimated **~5 million people worldwide**; expected to **double within 20 years** due to aging population.
- Mean age of onset: **~60 years**.
- Lifetime risk: **~3% for men, 2% for women**.
- Frequency increases with age; cases can occur in individuals in their twenties or younger, especially with a gene mutation.

# Clinical Features

- **Cardinal features**: **rest tremor, rigidity (stiffness), bradykinesia (slowing), and gait dysfunction with postural instability**.
- **Additional motor features**: freezing of gait, speech difficulty, swallowing impairment.
- **Nonmotor features**: autonomic disturbances, sensory alterations, mood disorders, sleep dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and dementia.

# Pathological Features and Disease Progression

- **Hallmark pathological features**:
    - **Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)**.
    - Reduced **striatal dopamine**.
    - **Intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions** staining for **α-synuclein** (known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, collectively **Lewy pathology**).
- **Wider pathology**: Lewy pathology can also affect:
    - Cholinergic neurons (nucleus basalis of Meynert)
    - Norepinephrine neurons (locus coeruleus)
    - Serotonin neurons (raphe nuclei)
    - Neurons of the olfactory system, cerebral hemispheres, spinal cord, and peripheral autonomic nervous system.
- **Nondopaminergic pathology**: Likely responsible for nonmotor clinical features.
- **Braak staging hypothesis**: Lewy pathology may begin in the peripheral autonomic nervous system, olfactory system, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, then spread sequentially to SNc and cerebral hemispheres.
- **Motor features as midstage**: Classic SNc degeneration and cardinal motor features develop at a midstage of the illness.
- **Premotor symptoms**: Clinical symptoms reflecting early involvement of nondopaminergic neurons, such as **constipation, anosmia, rapid eye movement (REM) behavior sleep disorder, and cardiac denervation**, can precede motor features by years or decades.
    - Initially considered risk factors, now likely represent an **early premotor form of the disease**.
- **Premotor stage research**: Efforts are underway to define a premotor stage with high sensitivity and specificity for initiating disease-modifying treatment at the earliest stage.

# Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

- **Parkinsonism**: A generic term for a syndrome manifest by **bradykinesia with rigidity and/or tremor**.
- **PD is most common form**: Accounts for **~75% of parkinsonism cases**.
- **Historical diagnosis**: Based on two of three parkinsonian features (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia), with a 24% error rate.
- **Revised criteria (U.K. Brain Bank Criteria)**: Parkinsonism (bradykinesia and rigidity) associated with **rest tremor, asymmetry of motor impairment, and good levodopa response** predicted correct pathological diagnosis in >90% of cases.
- **MDS Clinical Diagnostic Criteria**: Further increase diagnostic accuracy, especially in early cases.
    - Retains motor parkinsonism as core feature.
    - Relies on supportive criteria, absolute exclusion criteria, and red flags.
    - Delineates clinically established PD and clinically probable PD.

## Imaging of the Brain Dopamine System

- **Methods**: Positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
- **Findings in PD**: Typically show **reduced and asymmetric uptake of striatal dopaminergic biomarkers**, particularly in the **posterior putamen with relative sparing of the caudate nucleus**.
    - Reflects degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and loss of striatal terminals.
- **Utility**: Useful in diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., early stage, essential tremor, dystonic/psychogenic tremor) or for research accuracy.
- **Future potential**: May become necessary with disease-modifying therapies to make early diagnosis.
- **Other imaging**: Increased iron in SNc using transcranial sonography or special MRI protocols may help diagnose PD and pre-PD.

## Genetic Testing

- **Not routinely employed**: Monogenic forms of PD are relatively rare, **<10% of cases**.
- **Considered when**: Strong positive family history, early age of onset (<40 years), particular ethnic background, or in research studies.
- **Common genetic associations**:
    - **Glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) variants**: Present in 5–15% of PD patients, 25% of Ashkenazi PD patients. Only ~30% of GBA variant carriers develop PD by age 80.
    - **LRRK2 gene mutations**: Responsible for ~1% of typical sporadic cases. Common cause of PD (~25%) in Ashkenazi Jews and North African Berber Arabs, but with variable penetrance.
- **Research interest**: Useful for identifying at-risk individuals and defining enriched populations for clinical trials targeting specific mutations.

# Atypical, Secondary, and Other Forms of Parkinsonism

- **Atypical Parkinsonism**: Neurodegenerative conditions with **more widespread pathology than PD** (e.g., degeneration of striatum, globus pallidus, cerebellum, brainstem, as well as SNc).
    - Includes **multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS)**.
    - Tend to present with parkinsonism (rigidity and bradykinesia) but with clinical differences:
        - **Early involvement of speech and gait**.
        - **Absence of rest tremor**.
        - **Lack of motor asymmetry**.
        - **Poor or no response to levodopa**.
        - **More aggressive clinical course**.
    - Early stages may be difficult to distinguish from PD, but diagnosis clarifies over time.
    - **Dopamine system imaging usually not helpful** (striatal dopamine depletion seen in both).
    - **Metabolic imaging (2-F-deoxyglucose) may be helpful**: Shows decreased activity in GPi with increased activity in thalamus (reverse of PD).

## Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)

- Combination of atypical parkinsonian features with **cerebellar and autonomic features**.
- Clinical syndromes: Predominantly parkinsonian (MSA-p) or cerebellar (MSA-c) form.
- **Clinical suspicion**: Atypical parkinsonism with cerebellar signs and/or prominent autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension).
- **Pathology**: Degeneration of SNc, striatum, cerebellum, inferior olivary nuclei, coupled with **glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs)** staining for **α-synuclein** (Lewy bodies) particularly in **oligodendrocytes** (not SNc neurons as in PD).
- **MRI findings**: Pathologic iron accumulation in striatum on T2-weighted scans, high signal change in putaminal rim (MSA-p), or cerebellar/brainstem atrophy (pontine “hot cross bun” sign) (MSA-c).
- No established gene mutation/genetic risk factor.

## Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)

- Atypical parkinsonism characterized by **parkinsonism, slow ocular saccades, eyelid apraxia, and restricted vertical eye movements** (especially impaired downward gaze).
- Patients often have **hyperextension of the neck** with early gait disturbance and falls.
- Later stages: Speech/swallowing difficulty, cognitive impairment.
- **Clinical forms**:
    - “Parkinson” form: Can resemble PD early, may respond to levodopa.
    - “Richardson” form: Classic features, little/no levodopa response.
- **MRI**: Characteristic **midbrain atrophy with relative pons preservation** (hummingbird sign).
- **Pathology**: Degeneration of SNc, striatum, STN, midline thalamic nuclei, pallidum, coupled with **neurofibrillary tangles and inclusions staining for tau protein**.
- **Genetic**: Mutations in **MAPT gene** (encodes tau protein) detected in some familial cases.

## Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS)

- Uncommon condition, usually presents with **asymmetric dystonic contractions and clumsiness of one hand**coupled with **cortical sensory disturbances** (apraxia, agnosia, focal limb myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon).
- Dementia may occur at any stage.
- **Diagnosis**: Requires both cortical and basal ganglia features.
- **MRI**: Frequently shows **asymmetric cortical atrophy**.
- **Pathology**: Achromatic neuronal degeneration with tau deposits.
- Considerable clinical/pathological overlap with PSP, often difficult to distinguish without pathological confirmation.

## Secondary Parkinsonism

- Occur due to **other etiologic factors** such as **drugs, stroke, tumor, infection, or toxin exposure** (e.g., carbon monoxide, manganese) causing basal ganglia dysfunction.
- Clinical features reflect damaged basal ganglia region.
    - SNc damage (stroke/tumor) can mimic PD motor features.
    - Globus pallidus damage (toxins like carbon monoxide/manganese) can resemble atypical parkinsonism.
- **Most common cause**: **Dopamine-blocking agents (neuroleptics)**.
    - Used in psychiatry, but also drugs like metoclopramide (for GI problems) are neuroleptic agents.
    - Can also cause acute and tardive dyskinesias.
- **Other drugs**: Tetrabenazine, calcium channel blockers (flunarizine, cinnarizine), amiodarone, lithium.

## Dopa-Responsive Dystonia (DRD)

- Results from a **mutation in the GTP-Cyclohydrolase 1 gene**, leading to a defect in a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase, impairing dopa and dopamine manufacture.
- Typically presents as dystonia, but can present as a **biochemically based parkinsonism** resembling PD that **responds to levodopa**.
- **Distinguishing features**: Not associated with abnormalities on fluoro-dopa PET nor neurodegeneration.
- **Consider in**: Individuals **aged <20 years** with parkinsonism, especially with dystonic features.

## Other Neurodegenerative Disorders

- Parkinsonism can be a feature of: **Wilson’s disease, Huntington’s disease** (especially juvenile Westphal variant), certain **spinocerebellar ataxias**, and **neurodegenerative disorders with brain iron accumulation** (e.g., pantothenate kinase (PANK)–associated neurodegeneration).
- **Wilson’s disease**: Important to rule out, as progression can be prevented with copper chelators.

## Features Suggesting Atypical or Secondary Causes

- Specific features exist that suggest parkinsonism is due to a condition other than classic PD.

# Etiology and Pathogenesis

- **Most cases (∼85–90%) occur sporadically** and have unknown cause.
- **Gene mutations**: The only known causes of PD.
- **Twin studies**: Previously suggested environmental factors more important for onset ≥50 years, genetic for younger onset.
    - Later-onset genetic variants (LRRK2, GBA) argue against exclusive emphasis on environmental factors for older onset.
- **Environmental hypothesis**: MPTP (illicit drug byproduct) caused a PD syndrome by forming MPP+, a mitochondrial toxin selectively damaging dopamine neurons (typically without Lewy bodies).
    - MPTP or MPTP-like compounds have **not been linked to sporadic PD**.
- **Epidemiologic associations (inconsistent results)**:
    - **Increased risk**: Exposure to pesticides, rural living, farming, drinking well water.
    - **Possible protective factors**: Caffeine, cigarette smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium channel blockers. (Validity/mechanism unestablished).
- **Familial cases**: About **10% of PD cases are familial**; several PD-linked gene mutations identified.
- **Genetic risk factors**: Large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identified >25 independent gene variants (SNPs) as PD risk factors, including SNCA, LRRK2, MAPT, GBA, and HLA region.
- **"Double hit" hypothesis**: Many PD cases may involve interaction between **(a) genetic risk factor(s)** (inducing susceptibility) and **(b) toxic environmental factor exposure** (inducing epigenetic/somatic DNA alterations or direct dopaminergic damage).
    - Both factors required for disease to ensue.
- **Risk implications**: Even if a risk factor doubles PD risk, lifetime risk is **≤4%**, so not used for individual counseling.

## Pathogenetic Mechanisms of Cell Death

- **Implicated factors**: Oxidative stress, inflammation, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, lysosomal/proteasomal dysfunction, accumulation of misfolded proteins (proteolytic stress).
- **Aging factor**: Dopamine neurons may switch from sodium to calcium pacing, making them vulnerable to calcium-mediated neurotoxicity.
- **Cell death mechanism**: Appears to occur partly via a signal-mediated **apoptotic or "suicidal" process**.
- **Therapeutic targets**: Each mechanism offers a potential target for neuroprotective drugs.
- **Inflammation role**: Implicated by genetic association with **class II HLA gene DRB1** (variants associated with protection/risk) and presence of autoreactive T-cells recognizing alpha-synuclein peptides in PD patients.
- **Unclear primacy**: Not clear which factor is primary, if they are the same in all cases/subgroups, if they act in a network requiring multiple insults, or if findings are epiphenomena.

## Insights from Gene Mutations

- Though rare, gene mutations point to **specific pathogenic pathways and molecular mechanisms** likely central to sporadic PD.
- Most interest focused on pathways implicated by **SNCA, GBA, LRRK2, and PINK1/Parkin mutations**.

### SNCA (α-synuclein)

- **First PD-linked gene mutation** and most intensely investigated.
- **Clinical features (SNCA mutations)**: Earlier disease onset, faster progression of levodopa-responsive motor signs, early motor fluctuations, prominent nonmotor features (especially cognitive impairment).
- **Pathological significance**: **SNCA is major component of Lewy bodies**, implicating it in sporadic PD.
- **Gene dosage effect**: Duplication or triplication of wild-type SNCA also causes PD; triplication carriers more severely affected. Indicates **increased normal protein production alone can cause PD**.
- **Prion-like hypothesis**: Lewy pathology developed in healthy embryonic dopamine neurons implanted into PD patients, suggesting abnormal protein transfer.
    - SNCA can misfold to β-rich sheets, form toxic oligomers/aggregates, polymerize into amyloid plaques (Lewy bodies), and cause neurodegeneration with spread to unaffected neurons.
    - Injection of SNCA fibrils into rodent striatum leads to Lewy pathology, neurodegeneration, behavioral abnormalities, and spread.
    - Inoculation of human Lewy body homogenates into rodent/primate striatum induces dopamine cell degeneration and widespread Lewy pathology.
- **Gut-brain axis hypothesis**: SNCA pathology might begin peripherally in the enteric nervous system (GI tract) and spread via the vagus nerve to the lower brainstem (dorsal motor nucleus) and ultimately to the SNc.
    - Growing interest in gut microbiome causing inflammatory changes promoting alpha-synuclein misfolding and spread.
    - Offers a novel target for therapeutic intervention.
- **Neuroprotective strategies**: Inhibiting SNCA aggregate accumulation/removal, knocking down host SNCA levels, preventing spread of misfolded SNCA, or blocking templating phenomenon (prion-like reaction). Many are in lab testing and preliminary clinical trials.

### GBA (Glucocerebrosidase gene)

- **Most important risk factor** in terms of effect size for PD.
- **Function**: GBA encodes glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which **promotes lysosomal function and enhances clearance of misfolded proteins like SNCA**.
- **Pathophysiological link**: Increased SNCA levels linked to reduced GBA levels.
- **Clinical observation origin**: Patients with Gaucher’s disease (GD) and relatives often show parkinsonism, leading to discovery that **hundreds of GBA mutations confer PD risk**.
- **Vicious cycle**: Reduced GCase activity (due to GBA variants) impairs lysosomal function, leading to SNCA accumulation. Conversely, SNCA accumulation inhibits lysosomal function and further reduces GBA/GCase levels.
- **Sporadic PD relevance**: Lysosomal function is impaired and GCase levels are reduced in sporadic PD patients, not just those with GBA variants. This molecular pathway may apply broadly.
- **Clinical course**: GBA variant patients may have faster progression and increased cognitive impairment.
- **Therapies**: Drugs enhancing GCase activity and lysosomal function are being tested.

### LRRK2 Mutations

- **Multiple mutations linked to PD**, with p.G2019S being most common (founder effect in Ashkenazi Jewish and North African Arab populations).
- Account for **3–41% of familial PD cases** and found in sporadic cases.
- **Phenotype**: Largely indistinguishable from sporadic PD, but **tremor appears more common** (leg tremor a diagnostic clue).
- **Penetrance**: Incomplete (30–74%). Patients tend to run a more benign course.
- **Mechanism**: Not conclusively known, but thought to involve **enhanced kinase activity** (altered phosphorylation of target proteins, autophosphorylation) with possible impairment of lysosomal function.
- **Therapies**: Kinase inhibitors block LRRK2 toxicity in models; LRRK2 inhibitors developed with good preclinical safety are being tested in PD populations. Nonselective kinase inhibitors are potentially toxic to lungs/kidneys.

### Parkin and PINK1 Mutations

- **Parkin mutations**: More common, major cause of **autosomal recessive and early-onset PD** (up to 77% of juvenile PD <20 years, 10–20% of early-onset PD).
- **Clinical course**: Slowly progressive, good response to antiparkinsonian treatment, commonly complicated by dystonia, very rarely by dementia.
- **Pathology**: Neurodegeneration restricted to SNc and LC; **Lewy bodies typically absent**. May be related to impaired ubiquitination of damaged proteins (parkin is a ubiquitin ligase required for Lewy body formation).
- **Phenotype similarity**: Parkin- and PINK1-linked PD clinical phenotypes are similar.
- **Mechanism**: Parkin and PINK1 involved in **cell-protection and turnover/clearance of damaged mitochondria (mitophagy)**.
    - Mutations cause mitochondrial dysfunction, correctable by Parkin overexpression in animals.
    - **Mitochondrial dysfunction**: Postmortem studies in PD patients show a defect in complex I of the respiratory chain in SNc neurons.
- **Therapeutic target**: Improving mitochondrial function is attractive.

# Pathophysiology of PD

- **Basal ganglia organization**: Series of neuronal circuits with feedback/feedforward loops link basal ganglia nuclei with cortical and brainstem motor regions.
- **Striatum**: Major input region.
- **GPi and SNr**: Major output regions.
- **Pathways**: Input/output regions connected via direct and indirect pathways with reciprocal effects on basal ganglia output activity.
- **Basal ganglia output**: Provides inhibitory (GABAergic) tone to thalamic and brainstem neurons connected to motor systems.
    - **Increased GPi/SNr activity**: Associated with poverty of movement (parkinsonism).
    - **Decreased output**: Results in movement facilitation and involuntary movements (dyskinesia).
- **Dopaminergic projections from SNc**: Modulate neuronal firing and stabilize basal ganglia network.
    - Normal innervation facilitates desired movement selection and suppresses unwanted movements.
- **Cortical loops**: Integrate cortex and basal ganglia, regulate behavioral, emotional, and cognitive functions.
- **In PD**: **Dopamine denervation and loss of dopaminergic tone lead to increased firing of STN and GPi neurons, excessive thalamus inhibition, reduced cortical motor system activation, and parkinsonian features**.
- **Surgical rationale**: Current surgery is based on this model, predicting that STN/GPi lesions or high-frequency stimulation reduce neuronal overactivity and improve PD.
- **Dyskinesia understanding**: The classic model is less useful for understanding dyskinesia origins.

# Treatment

## Levodopa

- **Mainstay of therapy since late 1960s**.
- **Discovery**: Carlsson showed reserpine-induced parkinsonism reversed by levodopa; Hornykiewicz found dopamine deficiency in PD striatum.
- **Mechanism**: Dopamine precursor (dopamine doesn't cross BBB).
- **Formulations**:
    - Routinely administered with **peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor** (e.g., carbidopa in Sinemet, benserazide in Madopar) to prevent peripheral metabolism and reduce side effects (nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension).
    - Available in methylated, controlled-release (Sinemet CR, Madopar HP), and combination with COMT inhibitor (Stalevo) formulations.
    - Long-acting (Rytary) and continuous intraintestinal infusion (levodopa carbidopa intestinal gel) available.
    - Inhaled form recently approved for on-demand "off" episodes.
- **Efficacy**: **Most effective symptomatic treatment and gold standard**.
    - No current treatment provides superior antiparkinsonian benefits.
    - Benefits classic motor features, prolongs independence/employability, improves quality of life, increases life span.
    - Also benefits some "nondopaminergic" features like anxiety, depression, sweating.
    - **Almost all patients improve**; failure to respond questions diagnosis.
- **Limitations & Side Effects**:
    - **Acute dopaminergic side effects**: Nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension (usually transient, managed by low doses/gradual titration, or additional decarboxylase inhibitor/food/domperidone).
    - **Disease progression**: Falling, freezing, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, dementia may emerge and are not adequately controlled. These are primary source of disability in advanced PD.
    - **Motor complications (major concern with chronic use)**: Occur in large majority of patients.
        - **Fluctuations in motor response**: "on" (drug working) and "off" (parkinsonian features return) episodes.
        - **Wearing-off effect**: Duration of benefit shortens over time.
        - **On-off phenomenon**: Rapid, unpredictable switches between "on" and "off".
        - **Variable/unpredictable response**: In advanced cases, due to bioavailability issues, leading to full-on, partial-on, delayed-on, or no-on responses.
        - **Dyskinesias**: Involuntary movements, typically complicate "on" periods.
            - **Peak-dose dyskinesias**: Occur at peak plasma concentration/maximal benefit; usually choreiform, but can be dystonic/myoclonic. Can be disabling and limit higher levodopa doses.
            - **Diphasic dyskinesias**: Occur at lower plasma levels (as dose takes effect/wears off); transient, stereotypic, rhythmic movements, often lower extremities asymmetrically, associated with parkinsonism elsewhere. Relieved by increasing levodopa, but can induce peak-dose dyskinesia.
    - **Minimizing motor complications**: Use **lowest effective dose** and **polypharmacy** to avoid raising levodopa dose.
- **Cause of motor complications**: Not precisely known.
    - More likely in younger individuals, with higher levodopa doses, in women, and with more severe disease.
    - Thought to result from **alterations in GPi/SNr neuronal firing pattern** (pauses, bursts, synchrony) not just frequency, leading to "misinformation" transmission.
- **Nonphysiologic levodopa replacement**: Intermittent oral doses cause fluctuating plasma/brain dopamine levels, inducing molecular alterations in striatal neurons and neurophysiologic changes in pallidal output.
- **Continuous delivery hypothesis**: More continuous levodopa delivery might prevent motor complications.
    - Continuous intraintestinal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa or SC apomorphine infusion significantly improve "off" time and "on" time without dyskinesia in advanced patients.
    - Intestinal infusion (Duopa/Duodopa) approved, but has surgical/tubing complications and inconvenience.
    - New approaches for continuous SC or intraoral infusion, or long-acting oral levodopa formulations are being tested to avoid surgery.
- **Behavioral complications**:
    - **Dopamine dysregulation syndrome**: Cravings for levodopa, addictive use.
    - **Punding**: Purposeless, stereotyped behaviors (e.g., assembly/disassembly of objects) with high levodopa doses.
    - Hypersexuality and other impulse-control disorders (more common with dopamine agonists).
- **Neuroprotective debate**: Long-standing concern levodopa might accelerate degeneration due to oxidative metabolism; conversely, thought to have disease-modifying effect by restoring striatal dopamine.
    - Recent delayed-start study showed neither beneficial nor deleterious effects on progression.
    - Recommended solely for symptomatic benefits, balanced by risk of motor complications/side effects.

## Dopamine Agonists

- Diverse drugs acting directly on dopamine receptors.
- **Advantages over levodopa**: Do not require metabolic conversion, do not undergo oxidative metabolism. Less prone to induce dyskinesia (possibly due to longer action).
- **Initial use**: Adjuncts to levodopa to enhance motor function and reduce "off" time.
- **Current use**: Many physicians initiate therapy with dopamine agonists (especially in younger patients prone to motor complications), though supplemental levodopa eventually needed.
- **Efficacy**: Generally **not comparable efficacy to levodopa**. Apomorphine is the exception, thought comparable to levodopa.
- **Types**:
    - **Replaced ergot derivatives** (bromocriptine, pergolide, cabergoline) due to serious side effects (cardiac valvular damage, pulmonary fibrosis).
    - **Second generation non-ergot agonists**: Pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine.
        - Ropinirole and pramipexole: Oral immediate/extended-release formulations.
        - Rotigotine: Once-daily transdermal patch (useful for surgical patients unable to take oral therapy).
    - **Apomorphine**: Must be parenterally administered (rapidly metabolized orally). Short half-life (45 min).
        - SC injection: Rescue agent for severe "off" episodes.
        - Continuous SC infusion: Reduces "off" time and dyskinesia in advanced patients (approved in Europe).
        - Sublingual bilayer formulation: Recently approved for rapid/reliable "off" period treatment, avoiding SC injection.
- **Side Effects**:
    - **Acute**: Nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension (managed by low doses/slow titration).
    - **Chronic**: Hallucinations, cognitive impairment, leg edema.
    - **Sedation**: Sudden unintended sleep episodes (e.g., while driving). Patients must be informed.
    - **Impulse-control disorders**: Pathologic gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive eating/shopping. More frequent than with levodopa. Dose-related, minimized with lower doses.
    - **Apomorphine injection**: Skin lesions at sites of administration (minimized by proper cleaning/site alteration).
    - **Sublingual apomorphine**: High frequency of oropharyngeal side effects (generally mild, resolve spontaneously or with withdrawal).

## MAO-B Inhibitors

- Block central dopamine metabolism, **increase synaptic dopamine concentrations**.
- **Agents**: Selegiline and rasagiline (selective suicide inhibitors of MAO-B). Safinamide (reversible MAO-B inhibitor).
- **Clinical benefits**:
    - Antiparkinsonian benefits as **monotherapy in early disease**.
    - Reduce "off" time as **adjunct to levodopa** in fluctuating patients.
- **Safety**: Generally safe and well tolerated.
    - May increase dyskinesia in levodopa-treated patients (controlled by levodopa dose down-titration).
    - Do not functionally inhibit MAO-A, so **not associated with "cheese effect"** (hypertensive reaction from tyramine-rich foods) at clinical doses.
    - Theoretical risk of serotonin reaction with SSRI antidepressants, but rarely encountered.
- **Safinamide**: Also blocks activated sodium channels and inhibits glutamate release, potentially providing antidyskinetic and antiparkinsonian effects.
- **Disease-modifying potential (interest in)**:
    - Experimentally prevents MPTP toxicity (blocks conversion to toxic MPP+).
    - Potential to block dopamine oxidative metabolism and prevent oxidative stress.
    - Selegiline and rasagiline incorporate propargyl ring, providing antiapoptotic effects in lab models.
    - DATATOP study (selegiline): Delayed disability onset requiring levodopa, but unclear if neuroprotective or symptomatic masking.
    - ADAGIO study (rasagiline 1 mg/d): Early treatment provided benefits not seen with delayed treatment, consistent with disease-modifying effect. (Benefit not seen with 2-mg dose, not regulatory approved for this indication).

## COMT Inhibitors

- When levodopa is given with a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT primarily metabolizes it peripherally.
- **Mechanism**: **Increase levodopa elimination half-life and enhance brain availability**.
- **Clinical benefits**: Reduce "off" time, prolong "on" time, enhance motor scores in fluctuating patients.
- **Agents**: Tolcapone, entacapone, opicapone.
    - Tolcapone: Three times daily.
    - Entacapone: Combined with each levodopa dose.
    - Opicapone: Long-acting, once-daily (approved in Europe and US).
    - Combination tablet: Levodopa, carbidopa, entacapone (Stalevo).
- **Side Effects**:
    - **Primarily dopaminergic**: Nausea, vomiting, increased dyskinesia (controlled by 20–30% levodopa dose down-titration).
    - **Severe diarrhea**: Described with tolcapone, less so with entacapone (requires stopping in 5–10% of individuals).
    - **Fatal hepatic toxicity (rare)**: Reported with tolcapone (most effective COMT inhibitor), requires periodic liver function monitoring. Not encountered with entacapone or opicapone.
    - **Urine discoloration**: Due to metabolite accumulation, no clinical concern.
- **Continuous delivery hypothesis**: Initiating levodopa with a COMT inhibitor to enhance half-life proposed to provide continuous delivery and reduce motor complications.
    - Demonstrated in preclinical MPTP model; continuous infusion reduces "off" time and dyskinesia in advanced PD.
    - STRIDE-PD study: No benefit of initiating levodopa with COMT inhibitor vs. levodopa alone in early PD (possibly due to infrequent administration).
- **Main value**: In patients experiencing motor fluctuations.

## Other Medical Therapies

### Adenosine A2A Receptor Antagonists

- **Mechanism**: Inhibit A2A receptors that form heterodimers with D2 dopamine receptors on medium spiny striatal D2-bearing neurons of the indirect pathway.
    - Blockade **decreases excessive activation of indirect pathway**, theoretically restoring basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit balance, providing dopaminergic effect without increasing levodopa.
- **Use**: Generally combined with low levodopa doses.
- **Efficacy**: Modest antiparkinsonian effects with reduced motor complication risk.
- **Agents**: Istradefylline is currently approved for use (preladenant failed, tozadenant discontinued due to agranulocytosis).
    - Clinical trials showed improvement in "off" time comparable to other agents, but not in dyskinesia.
    - Generally well tolerated with dopaminergic adverse events.
- **Caffeine**: Potent A2A antagonist; large epidemiologic studies suggest coffee drinking associated with reduced PD frequency, raising question of neuroprotective effect (not established).

### Amantadine

- Originally an antiviral agent, now known for antiparkinsonian effects likely due to **N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism**.
- **Use**:
    - Some physicians use for mild symptomatic effects in early disease.
    - Most widely used as an **antidyskinesia agent in advanced PD**.
    - **Only oral agent demonstrated to reduce dyskinesia without worsening parkinsonism** (motor benefits reported).
- **Side Effects**:
    - **Cognitive impairment** (major concern, particularly with high doses).
    - Livedo reticularis, weight gain.
- **Withdrawal**: Always discontinue gradually due to withdrawal-like symptoms.
- Extended-release formulation recently approved in US.

### Central-Acting Anticholinergic Drugs

- Historically used (e.g., trihexyphenidyl, benztropine), lost favor with levodopa.
- **Major clinical effect**: On **tremor** (uncertain if superior to levodopa/dopamine agonists).
- Can be helpful for severe tremor in individual patients.
- **Use limited**: Especially in elderly, due to propensity to induce **urinary dysfunction, glaucoma, and particularly cognitive impairment**.

### Other Investigational Drugs

- Zonisamide (anticonvulsant) has antiparkinsonian effects, approved in Japan (mechanism unknown).
- Classes under investigation: nicotinic agonists, glutamate antagonists, and 5-HT1A agonists.

## On-Demand Therapies for "Off" Periods

- Many patients experience disabling "off" periods despite available therapies.
- Additional oral levodopa unreliable for individual "off" episodes.
- **Approved on-demand treatments**: **Inhaled levodopa, subcutaneous injections of apomorphine, and sublingual apomorphine**.
- **Benefits**: Avoid variable bioavailability of oral levodopa, provide relatively predictable return to "on" state.

## Neuroprotection

- **Major unmet therapeutic need**: Therapy that slows or stops disease progression.
- Some trials showed positive results (selegiline, rasagiline, pramipexole, ropinirole) consistent with disease-modifying effect, but **uncertainty whether due to neuroprotection or confounding symptomatic/pharmacologic effects**.
- **Novel targets from genetic/laboratory findings**:
    - Agents interfering with **SNCA accumulation**.
    - **LRRK2 inhibitors**.
    - **GBA and GCase enhancers**.
    - **Anti-inflammatory agents** inhibiting microglia activation and cytokine production.
- Many agents show promise in animal models and are in clinical trials.

## Surgical Treatment

- Used for >100 years.
    - Early lesions in motor cortex improved tremor but caused motor deficits (abandoned).
    - Ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of thalamus lesions reduced contralateral tremor without hemiparesis, but didn't help other disabling features.
    - Pallidotomy (lesions in posteroventral GPi): Improved rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and dramatically improved contralateral dyskinesia.
        - Not optimal due to side effects with bilateral lesions (dysphagia, dysarthria, cognitive impairment).
    - STN lesions: Antiparkinsonian benefit and reduced levodopa requirement, but concern about hemiballismus (not commonly performed).

### Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)

- **Most surgical procedures today use DBS**.
- **Mechanism**: Electrode placed into target, connected to stimulator subcutaneously over chest wall.
    - Simulates lesion effects without needing to make brain lesion.
    - Precise mechanism unresolved, may disrupt abnormal neurophysiologic signals.
    - Stimulation variables adjustable to maximize benefit/minimize side effects.
    - Suitable for bilateral procedures with relative safety as no brain lesion is made.
    - System can be stopped/removed if side effects intolerable.
- **Targets**: Primarily **STN or GPi**.
- **Benefits**: **Dramatic results, particularly for tremor and reducing "off" time and dyskinesias**.
    - Does not provide superior clinical benefits to levodopa.
    - GPi stimulation may be associated with reduced depression frequency compared to STN.
- **Indications**: Primarily for patients with **disability from levodopa-induced motor complications** (uncontrolled by drug manipulation) or **severe tremor**.
- **Side Effects**:
    - **Surgical procedure**: Hemorrhage, infarction, infection.
    - **DBS system**: Infection, lead break, lead displacement, skin ulceration.
    - **Stimulation itself**: Ocular/speech abnormalities, muscle twitches, paresthesias, depression, rarely suicide.
- **Long-term**: Continued benefits for classic motor features, but does **not prevent development of nondopaminergic features** (continue to evolve, source of disability).
- **Early PD use**: Benefits may be superior to best medical therapy, but must weigh costs/risks.
- **Future**: Utility may be reduced if new medical therapies provide levodopa benefits without motor complications.
- **New targets explored**: For gait dysfunction, depression, cognitive impairment.
- **"Smart" closed-loop devices**: Sense patient need for stimulation.

### MRI-Guided Ultrasound

- Used to damage critical target regions (GPi, STN) noninvasively, avoiding surgery.
- Preliminary results show good target localization and safety.

## Other Experimental Therapies for PD

### Cell-Based Therapies

- **Concept**: Implanting dopaminergic cells into striatum to replace degenerating SNc dopamine neurons.
- **Fetal nigral mesencephalic cells**: Survive implantation, re-innervate striatum, restore motor function in PD models.
    - However, two double-blind studies showed **no significant benefit vs. sham operation**.
    - Associated with **graft-induced dyskinesia** (persists after lowering/stopping levodopa), possibly due to suboptimal dopamine release leading to sustained diphasic dyskinesia.
    - Transplanted healthy embryonic dopamine neurons can develop PD pathology and dysfunction after years, suggesting **α-synuclein transfer in a prion-like manner**.
    - Unclear how replacing dopamine cells alone will improve nondopaminergic features (falling, dementia), major sources of disability.
- **Stem cells (especially iPSCs)**: May overcome immunity, cell type/number, physiologic integration issues.
    - Still share many concerns of fetal cells.
    - Not yet properly tested in PD patients, bear additional concern of tumors and unanticipated side effects.
    - No scientific basis for routine treatment of PD patients as marketed in some countries.

### Trophic Factors

- Proteins that enhance neuronal growth and restore function to damaged neurons.
- **Agents of interest**: Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin.
- **Clinical trials (GDNF)**: Double-blind trials of intraventricular and intraputaminal infusions failed to show benefits vs. placebo, possibly due to inadequate delivery to target region.

### Gene Therapy

- **Potential**: Long-term expression of a therapeutic protein with a single procedure.
- **Mechanism**: Nucleic acid of therapeutic protein placed into viral vector (often AAV2) for host cell uptake, genome incorporation, and continual synthesis/release.
    - AAV2 virus: Does not promote inflammation, not incorporated into host genome, no insertional mutagenesis, long-lasting transgene expression.
- **Clinical trials (neurturin)**: Promising open-label results, but **failed in double-blind trials** (even with injection into putamen and SNc).
    - Long-term postmortem studies showed transgene survival with biological effects for 10 years, but very small putaminal coverage; higher gene doses likely needed.
- **Other applications**: Delivering aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (with/without tyrosine hydroxylase) to striatum to facilitate levodopa conversion to dopamine.
    - Animal studies suggest antiparkinsonian benefits with reduced motor complications; human trials underway.
- **GBA enhancement**: Gene therapy being studied to enhance GBA and GCase to promote toxic alpha synuclein clearance.
- **Safety**: No clinically significant adverse events to date, but risk of unanticipated side effects remains.
- **Limitation**: Not clear how current approaches, even if successful, will address nondopaminergic features.

## Management of Nonmotor and Nondopaminergic Features of PD

- **Important to manage**, even though focus is often on dopaminergic features.
- **Some nonmotor features benefit from dopaminergic drugs**: Anxiety, panic attacks, depression, pain, sweating, sensory problems, freezing, constipation tend to worsen in "off" periods and improve with better dopaminergic control.

### Psychosis

- Problem for some PD patients, often a **harbinger of developing dementia**.
- **Hallucinations**: Typically visual, formed, and nonthreatening (unlike AD).
- **Management**:
    - Can limit use of dopaminergic agents; first approach is **withdrawal of less effective dopaminergic agents**(anticholinergics, amantadine, dopamine agonists), then lowering levodopa dose if possible.
    - Often responds to **low doses of atypical neuroleptics** (permits higher levodopa doses).
    - **Clozapine**: Effective, but risk of agranulocytosis (requires regular monitoring).
    - Quetiapine: Avoids agranulocytosis, but effectiveness not established in placebo-controlled trials.
    - **Pimavanserin (Nuplazid)**: Inverse agonist of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor; effective in double-blind trials with good safety profile; recently approved in US.

### Dementia in PD (PDD)

- **Common, affecting up to 80% of patients**.
- **Frequency increases with aging**.
- **Cognitive profile (unlike AD)**: Primarily affects **executive functions and attention**, with relative sparing of language, memory, calculation.
- **Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)**: By convention, when dementia precedes, develops coincident with, or occurs within 1 year after motor dysfunction onset.
    - Prone to hallucinations and diurnal fluctuations.
    - Pathology: Lewy bodies distributed throughout cerebral cortex (hippocampus, amygdala), more likely associated with AD pathology.
    - Likely a spectrum with PDD, not separate entities.
    - GBA gene variants are significant risk factor for both PD and DLB.
- **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)**: Frequently precedes dementia, more reliable index of impending dementia than in general population.
- **Early cognitive abnormalities**: Many PD patients show cognitive testing abnormalities even at earliest stages without overt clinical dysfunction.
- **Drug effects**: PD drugs can worsen cognition; should be stopped/reduced for compromise between antiparkinsonian benefit and cognitive function.
    - Drugs usually discontinued in sequence: anticholinergics, amantadine, dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors, MAO-B inhibitors.
    - Manage with lowest dose of standard levodopa that provides meaningful antiparkinsonian effects and does not worsen mental function.
- **Therapies**: Anticholinesterase agents (e.g., memantine, rivastigmine) improve cognitive function measures and attention, but not meaningful cognition or quality of life.
- **Critical unmet need**: More effective therapies for dementia.

### Autonomic Disturbances

- Common and often require attention.
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Problematic, contributes to falling.
    - **Initial treatment**: Add salt to diet, elevate head of bed (prevents overnight sodium natriuresis).
    - **Medications**: Low doses of fludrocortisone or midodrine for most cases.
    - **Droxidopa**: Norepinephrine precursor, mild/transient benefits, recently FDA approved.
    - Vasopressin and erythropoietin for severe/refractory cases.
    - If prominent in early parkinsonism, consider MSA diagnosis.
- **Sexual dysfunction**: May be helped with sildenafil or tadalafil.
- **Urinary problems**: Consult urologist (especially males, to exclude prostate issues); anticholinergic agents like oxybutynin may help.
- **Constipation**: Very important problem.
    - Ensure adequate fluid intake, diet rich in bulk (green leafy vegetables, bran).
    - Mild laxatives or enemas can be useful.
    - Agents promoting GI motility also helpful.
    - Studies evaluating agents that interfere with inflammation and alpha synuclein misfolding in GI tract.

### Sleep Disturbances

- **Common**: Fragmented sleep with excess daytime sleepiness.
- Restless leg syndrome, sleep apnea, other sleep disorders occur more frequently and should be treated.
- **REM behavior disorder (RBD)**: Violent movements/vocalizations during REM sleep (acting out dreams due to failed motor inhibition).
    - Many PD patients have history of RBD preceding motor features by years.
    - Most cases eventually develop an α-synucleinopathy (PD or MSA).
    - **Treatment**: Low doses of clonazepam (0.5–1 mg at bedtime) usually effective.
- Consult sleep specialist and polysomnography may be necessary.
- **Excess daytime sleepiness**: Therapies like Xyrem (for narcolepsy) being evaluated.

## Nonpharmacologic Therapy

### Gait Dysfunction and Falling

- Important cause of disability.
- Dopaminergic therapies help if gait worse in "off" times.
- No specific therapies currently available for gait dysfunction.
- Canes and walkers may be necessary to increase stability and reduce fall risk.
- Effective therapy for gait impairment is an important unmet need.

### Freezing

- Patients suddenly stuck in place for seconds to minutes.
- Major cause of falling.
- May occur during "on" or "off" periods.
- "Off"-period freezing may respond to dopaminergic therapies.
- No specific treatments for "on"-period freezing (mechanism not well understood).
- Some patients respond to **sensory cues** (marching in place, singing, stepping over imaginary line/obstacle).

### Speech Impairment

- Source of disability for many advanced PD patients.
- Speech therapy programs may be helpful, but benefits generally limited and transient.

### Exercise

- Shown to **maintain and even improve function** for PD patients.
- Active and passive exercises with full range of motion reduce arthritis and frozen joints.
- Some lab studies suggest possible neuroprotective effects (not confirmed in patients).
- **Generally recommended for all PD patients**.
- Unclear if specific types of physical therapy (tai chi, dance) offer specific advantage.

### Social and Intellectual Activities / Caregiver Needs

- Patients should maintain social and intellectual activities to extent possible.
- Education, financial planning assistance, social services, home safety attention are important.
- Caregivers' needs should not be neglected; caring for PD patient involves substantial work, increased incidence of depression among caregivers.
- Support groups useful for patients and caregivers.

# Current Management of PD

- **Tailored to individual patient needs**; no universally accepted approach.
- **Neuroprotective therapy (if proven)**: Should be initiated at diagnosis.
    - Dopamine terminal degeneration may be complete within 4 years of diagnosis.
    - Constipation, RBD, anosmia (premotor features), and dopamine system imaging could permit diagnosis and disease-modifying therapy before classic motor features.
    - No therapy conclusively proven disease-modifying, though **rasagiline 1 mg/day** met primary endpoints consistent with this. Physicians use judgment for its use.
- **When to initiate symptomatic therapy**:
    - Some suggest starting at diagnosis to preserve compensatory mechanisms and provide functional benefits.
    - Others prefer delaying levodopa, especially in younger patients, to reduce motor complication risk.
- **Which agent to initiate**:
    - **Levodopa**: Most effective symptomatic therapy. Some recommend starting immediately with **low doses (≤400 mg/d)**, as motor complications are dose-related.
    - **MAO-B inhibitor and/or dopamine agonist**: Alternate approach, reserving levodopa for later stages.
    - **Factors to consider**: Age, disability degree, drug side effect profile.
    - **Levodopa favored**: For more severe disability, elderly, those with cognitive impairment, significant comorbidities, or uncertain diagnosis.
- **Polypharmacy**: Most patients ultimately require a combination of levodopa, MAO-B inhibitor, and dopamine agonist to minimize total daily levodopa dose and reduce motor complication risk.
    - Use low doses of each agent to reduce side effects.
    - Do not deny levodopa if alternative medications are inadequate.
- **Patient discussion**: Discuss risks and benefits of options for informed decisions.
- **Management of motor complications**:
    - **Initial approach**: Adjust frequency/dose of levodopa, or combine lower levodopa doses with a dopamine agonist, COMT inhibitor, or MAO-B inhibitor.
    - **Istradefylline (A2A antagonist)**: Approved in US for "off" periods.
    - **Amantadine**: Only drug demonstrated to treat dyskinesia without worsening parkinsonism, but benefits may decline, and cognitive side effects are important.
    - **Advanced cases**: If medical therapies inadequate, consider **surgical procedures (DBS or Duodopa)**, but these have complications.
    - **DBS in early PD**: Advocated by some, but skepticism due to costs/side effects vs. inexpensive, well-tolerated medical alternatives.
    - **Duodopa (continuous intraintestinal infusion)**: Similar benefits to DBS, but also requires surgery with complications.
    - **Continuous apomorphine infusion**: Does not require surgery, but associated with skin nodules.
    - **Future goals**: Developing systems for **continuous levodopa delivery** or long-acting levodopa formulations to provide benefits without motor complications and avoid polypharmacy/surgery.
- **Nonmotor features**: Treatment should be instituted as appropriate.
- **Exercise therapy**: Recommended for all patients.

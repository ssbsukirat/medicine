- subset of dementia cases due primarily to one or more symptomatic strokes.
- usually ranked the second most frequent cause of dementia 
- broadened to encompass the full impact of cerebrovascular disease on age-related cognitive decline
- ***vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID)*** reflects the observation that pathologic changes involving the cerebral vasculature are highly prevalent in the elderly and contribute to cognitive impairment
- Symptomatic stroke and asymptomatic vascular lesions, both contribute importantly to cognitive impairment 
- increased risk of cognitive impairment among individuals without symptomatic stroke but with MRI evidence of cerebrovascular disease 
# SUBTYPES OF CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH VCID
## Large Cerebral Strokes
- Symptomatic strokes reflect ***irreversible injury*** to discrete areas of cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, or other subcortical and infratentorial structures and produce cognitive impairment as a function of their size and location
- thalamus, medial temporal cortex, anterior corpus callosum, or dominant-side angular gyrus  stroke can be sufficient to meet criteria for dementia
- Multiple strokes and larger volumes of infarcted territory are associated with a higher likelihood of poststroke cognitive dysfunction.
- ongoing effects of the cerebrovascular disease that gave rise to the index stroke as well as loss of cognitive reserve that makes the brain less resilient to any additional age-related disorders 
## Cerebral Small-Vessel Disease
- also cause symptomatic ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke 
- mostly clinically asymptomatic and recognized only during evaluation for cognitive decline or other symptoms
- ***Arteriolosclerosis*** 
    - represents thickening of arterioles due to infiltration of plasma proteins into the vessel wall
    - Risk factors are age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus
    - present as a cause of ischemic or hemorrhagic symptomatic stroke, both most commonly centered in territories supplied by deep penetrating vessels such as thalamus, basal ganglia, or brainstem
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy
    - deposition of the β-amyloid peptide in the walls of small cerebral arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, with consequent loss of normal wall structure
    - primary risk factor is advancing age 
    - often recognized symptomatically as a cause of intracerebral hemorrhage
    - in cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter (collectively known as lobar hemorrhages), or the cerebral convexity subarachnoid space
- Small (lacunar) infarcts are a common feature of arteriolosclerosis and less commonly of cerebral amyloid angiopathy 
- Chronic lacunar infarcts can appear on MRI fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences as a hyperintense rim surrounding a hypointense cavitated core with diameters typically 3–15 mm
- Microinfarcts <3 mm are characteristic of both small-vessel diseases. They are substantially more numerous than lacunar infarcts but less easily visualized. Acute microinfarcts may be visible as punctate hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted MRI images
- Cerebral microbleeds are less numerous than lacunes or microinfarcts but readily detected in their chronic stage because of the paramagnetic effects of iron products 
- White matter hyperintensities on T2-weighted or FLAIR MRI sequences are an almost ubiquitous feature of aging
- ***Binswangers disease***
    - aka subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy
    - Extremely severe diffuse white matter vascular injury
    - gradual cognitive deterioration and notable white matter changes of small-vessel ischemic disease
    - progressive confluent subcortical and periventricular white matter disease is seen with hypoperfusion and hypometabolism 
## Role of Accompanying Brain Pathologies
- large strokes and small-vessel disease often occur in combination with neurodegenerative brain diseases, most commonly Alzheimer’s disease
- co-occurrence of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative lesions produces more cognitive and functional impairment than expected from the effects of each disease mechanism considered independently
- interactions might involve loss of blood-brain barrier integrity (possibly allowing brain penetration of neurotoxic or inflammatory agents) and impaired clearance of β-amyloid 
# Approach 
- identifying vascular risk factors 
    - hypertension,
    - diabetes mellitus, 
    - dyslipidemia, tobacco use, 
    - atrial fibrillation, 
    - coronary artery disease, or 
    - peripheral vascular disease)
- history of prior symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack
- family history of early stroke or vascular disease
- stepwise progression and certain cognitive deficits such as loss of executive function are particularly suggestive, most individuals with VCID follow the more typical pattern of gradual progression of impaired episodic memory
- mainstay for detection and subtyping of cerebrovascular disease is brain MRI
- MRI should include FLAIR, diffusion-weighed, and T2* -weighted sequences to detect the range of lesions noted above: large and small chronic infarcts, acute microinfarcts, microbleeds, and white matter hyperintensities
- Genetic testing for rare hereditary forms of VCID such as ***cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)*** or hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy can be considered for cases in which there is a particularly young onset, positive family history, or suggestive neuroimaging, but is otherwise unnecessary
# Treatment
- follow primary stroke prevention guidelines
- managing blood pressure, controlling cholesterol, reducing blood sugar, maintaining an active lifestyle, adhering to a heart-healthy diet, losing weight, and discontinuing smoking
- Blood pressure targets are <140/90 mmHg for all individuals and <130/80 mmHg for those with estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk ≥10%
- imaging appearance suggests embolic or large-vesselrelated strokes statins and antiplatelets (but less useful in asymptomatic)
- asymptomatic infarcts should be screened for atrial fibrillation, and those with embolic-appearing infarcts can be considered for prolonged cardiac monitoring
- consider agents such as the cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine for mild to moderate cognitive impairment and high-dose donepezil or the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist memantine for moderate to severe impairment

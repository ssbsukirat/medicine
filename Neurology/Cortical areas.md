MCA Territoy 
- Somatic motor and sensory area --> motor + sensation of contralateral (pinprick, cotton touch, vibration, position, two-point discrimination, stereognosis, tactile localization, barognosis, cutaneographia)
- Dominant parietal 
	- Motor speech area
	- Central, suprasylvian speech area and parietooccipital cortex --> aphasia , word deafness, anomia, jargon speech, sensory agraphia, **acalculia, alexia, finger agnosia, right-left confusion (the last four comprise the Gerstmann syndrome)**
	- Conduction aphasia 
- Non-dominant parietal 
	- hemiasomatognosia, 
	- unilateral neglect, 
	- agnosia for the left half of external space, 
	- dressing “apraxia,” constructional “apraxia,” 
	- distortion of visual coordinates, 
	- inaccurate localization in the half field,
	- impaired ability to judge distance, upside- down reading, visual illusions (e.g., it may appear that another person walks through a table)
- homonymous hemianopia 
- conjugate gaze to opposite side 
- frontal
	- motor and sensory to arm 
	- **primary motor area** 
	- **supplemental motor area** - contralateral grasp, sucking, gegenhalten - 
	- gait and stance - gait apraxia 
	- prefrontal --> emotional, behavioural, cognitive 
	- Brocas 
	- Frontal eye field 
- Urinary incontinence - paracentral lobule (both parietal and frontal ) 
- Abulia (akinetic mutism), slowness, delay, intermittent interruption, lack of spontaneity, whispering, reflex distraction to sights and sounds --> cingulate gyrus and medial inferior portion of frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes

- autoimmune disease of CNS characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (plaques or scarring), and neuronal loss
- can be relapsing or progressive 
- plaques typically develop at different times and in different CNS locations (i.e., MS is said to be ***disseminated in time and space)***
# Clinical 
- abrupt or insidious onset 
- may be severe or seem so trivial that a patient may not seek medical attention for months or years 
- Examination often reveals evidence of neurologic dysfunction, often in asymptomatic locations 
- Sensory 
	- include both ***paresthesias*** (e.g., tingling, prickling sensations, formications, “pins and needles,” or painful burning) and ***hypesthesia*** (e.g., reduced sensation, numbness, or a “dead” feeling)
	- Unpleasant sensations (e.g., feelings that body parts are swollen, wet, raw, or tightly wrapped) are also common 
	- ***sensory level*** Sensory impairment of the trunk and legs below a horizontal line on the torso indicates that the spinal cord is the origin of the disturbance and accompanied by ***bandlike sensation*** or tightness around torso 
	- Pain common and in >50% 
- Optic Neuritis 
	- diminished visual acuity, dimness, or decreased color perception (desaturation) in the central field of vision
	- Rarely, there is complete loss of light perception 
	- monocular usually but maybe bilateral 
	- Periorbital pain (aggravated by eye movement) often precedes or accompanies the visual loss 
	- Afferent pupillary defect usually present 
	- Fundoscopy maybe normal or have ***papillitis*** 
	- Pallor of the optic disc ***(optic atrophy)*** commonly follows ON. 
	- Uveitis uncommon and suggests lymphoma or sarcoid 
- Weakness of the limbs 
	- may manifest as loss of strength, speed, or dexterity; 
	- as fatigue; or 
	- as a disturbance of gait.
	- Exercise induced weakness is characteristic 
	- UMN typr with pyramidal signs like spasticity, hyperreflexia and babinski positive 
	- Loss of tendon reflex rarely due to disruption of afferent fibers in spinal cord 
- Facial weakness 
	- due to a lesion in the pons 
	- may resemble idiopathic Bell’s palsy  
	- Unlike Bell’s palsy, facial weakness in MS is usually ***not associated with ipsilateral loss of taste sensation or retro- auricular pain***
- Spasticity 
	- commonly associated with spontaneous and movement-induced muscle spasm 
	- in 30% moderate to severe spasticity, especially in the legs 
	- accompanied by painful spasms interfering with ambulation, work, or self-care. 
	- Occasionally, spasticity provides support for the body weight during ambulation, and in these cases, treatment of spasticity may actually do more harm than good. 
- Visual Blurring 
	- from ON or Diplopia 
	- if resolves when either eye is covered, the cause is diplopia
	- Diplopia may be caused by internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) or palsy of the sixth cranial nerve (rarely the third or fourth
	- INO consists of impaired adduction of one eye due to a lesion in the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus
	- Prominent nystagmus is often observed in the abducting eye, along with a small skew deviation. 
	- bilateral INO is particularly suggestive of MS. 
	- Other common gaze disturbances in MS include
		- (1) a horizontal gaze palsy,
		- (2) a “one and a half” syndrome (horizontal gaze palsy plus an INO), and
		- (3) acquired pendular nystagmus.
- Ataxia usually manifests as cerebellar tremors may also involve the head and trunk or the voice, producing a characteristic cerebellar dysarthria (scanning speech).
- Vertigo may appear suddenly from a brainstem lesion, superficially resembling acute labyrinthitis
# ancillary symptoms 
- Paroxysmal symptoms are distinguished by their
	- brief duration (10 s to 2 min),
	- high frequency (5–40 episodes per day),
	- lack of any alteration of consciousness or change in background electroencephalogram during episodes, and a 
	- self-limited course (generally lasting weeks to months). 
	- They may be precipitated by hyperventilation or movement
	- include 
		- Lhermitte’s symptom; 
		- tonic contractions of a limb, face, or trunk (tonic seizures); 
		- paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia; 
		- paroxysmal sensory disturbances; and
		- several other less well-characterized syndromes.
- Lhermitte’s symptom 
	- is an electric shock–like sensation (typically induced by flexion or other movements of the neck)
	- that radiates down the back into the legs.
	- Rarely, it radiates into the arms.
	- It is generally self-limited but may persist for years.
	- also with disorders of the cervical spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis)
- Trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia occur when lesion involves the root entry (or exit) zone of the fifth, seventh, and ninth cranial nerve, respectively
- Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) 
	- is a very brief lancinnating facial pain 
	- often triggered by an afferent input from the face or teeth. 
	- Most cases not MS related; 
	- atypical features suggest MS 
		- such as onset before age 50 years, 
		- bilateral symptoms, 
		- objective sensory loss,
		- or nonparoxysmal pain
- Facial myokymia 
	- persistent rapid flickering contractions of the facial musculature (especially the lower portion of the orbicularis oculus) or a 
	- contraction that slowly spreads across the face. 
	- It results from lesions of the corticobulbar tracts or brainstem course of the facial nerve
- Heat sensitivity 
	- neurologic symptoms produced by an elevation of the body’s core temperature. 
	- For example, unilateral visual blurring may occur during a hot shower or with physical exercise (Uhthoff’s symptom)
- Bladder dysfunction is present in >90% of MS patients
	- weekly or more frequent episodes of incontinence in 1/3
	- Detrusor hyperreflexia, due to impairment of suprasegmental inhibition, causes urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and uncontrolled bladder emptying. 
	- Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, due to loss of synchronization between detrusor and sphincter muscles, causes difficulty in initiating and/or stopping the urinary stream, producing hesitancy, urinary retention, overflow incontinence, and recurrent infection
- Constipation occurs in >30% of patients
- Sexual dysfunction may manifest as decreased libido, impaired genital sensation, impotence in men, and diminished vaginal lubrication or adductor spasms in women
- Cognitive dysfunction can include memory loss; impaired attention; difficulties in executive functioning, memory, and problem solving; slowed information processing; and problems shifting between cognitive tasks. 
- Euphoria (elevated mood) was once thought to be characteristic of MS but is actually uncommon
- Fatigue(90% patients have) can be exacerbated by elevated temperatures, depression, expending exceptional effort to accomplish basic activities of daily living, or sleep disturbances (e.g., from frequent nocturnal awakenings to urinate
# Disease Course
- 3 types 
- Relapsing or bout onset MS 
	- 90% 
	- discrete attacks of neurologic dysfunction that generally evolve over days to weeks (rarely over hours)
	- there is often substantial or complete recovery over the ensuing weeks to months.
	- However, as attacks continue, recovery may be less evident
	- patients with RMS experience subtle “silent” progression even when relapse-free.
- Secondary progressive 
	- begins as RMS
	- patient experiences progressive deterioration in function unassociated with acute attacks.
	- greater amount of fixed neurologic disability than RMS
	- much lower rate of evolution to SPMS, estimated at slightly >1% each year, likely due to widespread use of effective therapies for MS
- Primary progressive MS (PPMS) 
	- accounts for ~10% of cases
	- do not experience attacks but rather steadily decline in function from disease onset
	- sex distribution is more even, 
	- the disease begins later in life (mean age ~40 years), and 
	- disability develops faster (relative to the onset of the first clinical symptom).
	- Progressive MS patients experiencing relapses or who are found to have acute new lesions on MRI are considered to have “active” progressive MS.
- ![[MScourse.png]] 
# Epidemiology
- threefold more common in women than men
- typically between 20 and 40 years (slightly later in men than in women), but the disease can present across the lifespan.
- risk factors for MS include 
	- a genetic predisposition, 
	- vitamin D deficiency, 
	- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) exposure after early childhood, and 
	- cigarette smoking
- Vitamin D 
	- deficiency is associated with an increase in MS risk, 
	- ongoing deficiency increases disease activity after MS begins. 
	- Immunoregulatory effects of vitamin D explains these relationships

# Genetics
- Susceptibility to MS is polygenic
- HLA)DRB1 gene in the class II region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and specifically to HLA-DR15 strongest 
- interleukin (IL) 7 receptor (CD127), IL-2 receptor (CD25), and T-cell costimulatory molecule LFA-3 (CD58) are others 
- .![[Msgenetics.png]]

# Pathology
## Demyelination
- New MS lesions begin with perivenular cuffing by inflammatory mononuclear cells, predominantly T cells and macrophages, which also infiltrate the surrounding white matter.
- BBB disrupted at inflammation but vessel wall preserved (unlike vasculitis)
- CD8 cells at leading edge 
- Humoral involvement suggested by B lymphos 
- Sharply demarcated areas of demyelination are the pathologic hallmark of MS lesions
- relative sparing of axons is typical, partial or total axonal destruction can also occur, especially within highly inflammatory lesions.
- surviving oligodendrocytes or those that differentiate from precursor cells partially remyelinate the surviving axons, producing so-called shadow plaques
- promoting remyelination to protect axons remains an important therapeutic goal.
- there is prominent astrocytic proliferation (gliosis) and the term sclerosis refers to these gliotic plaques that have a rubbery or hardened texture at autopsy.
## Neurodegeneration
- Cumulative axonal and neuronal loss is the most important contributor to neuro deficit
- 70% of axons are ultimately lost from the lateral corticospinal (e.g., motor) tracts at paraplegia 
- Axons can adapt initially to these injuries, but over time distal and retrograde degeneration (“dying-back” axonopathy) occurs.
- Chronic active plaques are
	- preexisting white matter lesions that show evidence of persistent inflammation, progressive axonal loss, and gradual concentric expansion, 
	- with large numbers of microglial cells at the leading edge of enlarging lesions 
	- but without BBB disruption
- Cortical plaques
	- are frequent in MS but are 
	- generally not well visualized by MRI;
	- extend upward from adjacent white matter lesions, or may be located within the cortex or underneath the pia
- Ectopic lymphoid follicles are 
	- aggregates of B, T, and plasma cells located in the superficial meninges, especially overlying deep cortical sulci; 
	- similar clusters are also present in perivascular spaces. 
	- topographically associated with underlying demyelination and neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex, 
	-  diffusible factors from these mediate subpial cortical demyelination and neurodegeneration
- relapsing MS, inflammation is associated with focal perivenular parenchymal infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes associated with BBB disruption and active demyelination.
- inflammation in progressive MS is more diffuse and is characterized by widespread microglial activation across large areas of white matter, associated with reduced myelin staining and axonal injury (“dirty white matter”).
- ongoing inflammation occurs behind an intact BBB in many patients with progressive MS, and this feature could explain the failure of immunotherapies not capable of crossing the BBB 

# physiology
- myelinated neurons have saltatory nerve conduction
- Produces faster nerve conduction (70m/s)
- Conduction block when impulse cannot cross demyelinated segment due to hyper polarisation of membranes by exposure of voltage dependent potassium channels
- temporary conduction block often follows a demyelinating event before sodium channels (originally concentrated at the nodes) redistribute along the naked axon
- Variable conduction block can occur with raised body temperature or metabolic alterations and may explain clinical fluctuations that vary from hour to hour or appear with fever or exercise
# Immunology
- proinflammatory autoimmune response directed against a c ponent of CNS myelin, and perhaps other neural elements as well, remains the cornerstone of current concepts of MS pathogenesis
# Autoreactive T lymphocytes
- Myelin basic protein (MBP), an intracellular protein involved in myelin compaction, is an important T-cell antigen
- Activated MBP-reactive T cells have been identified in the blood, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and within MS lesions.
- HLA-DR15 protein binds with high affinity to a f ment of MBP (spanning amino acids 89–96), potentially stimulating T-cell responses to this self-protein
- TH1 cells and TH1 cytokines, including IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IFN-γ 
- TNF-α and IFN-γ may directly injure oligodendrocytes or the myelin membrane.
- CD8 cytotoxic T cells are present at the active edges of expanding MS lesions, and activated CD8 cells also appear to be enriched for reactivity against myelin antigens in MS patients
# HUMORAL AUTOIMMUNITY
- B-cell activation and antibody responses are centrally involved
- Clonally restricted populations of activated, antigen-experienced, memory B cells and plasma cells are present in MS lesions, in meningeal lymphoid follicle-like structures overlying the cerebral cortex, and in the CSF.
- Myelin-specific autoantibodies, some directed against an e cellular myelin protein, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)
- CSF, elevated levels of locally synthesized immunoglobulins and oligoclonal antibodies, derived from clonally restricted CNS B cells and plasma cells, are also characteristic 
- pattern of oligoclonal banding is unique to each individual,
- antigen presenting cell (APC) function of B cells may explain their role in MS pathogenesis
- fragments of self-peptides derived from HLA-DR2 proteins themselves were found to bind intact DR2 molecules on B cells and serve as antigens for presentation to T cells. Memory CD4+ T cells derived from CSF responded to these self-peptides bound to DR2 molecules and, in some cases, these self-peptides were cross-reactive with myelin a gens, RAS guanyl-releasing protein 2 (RASGRP2) previously found to be a possible T-cell autoantigen in MS, EBV, and Akkermansia muciniphila, a commensal gut bacterium associated with dysbiosis
# Diagnosis 
- no single diagnostic test 
- ![[mscriteria.png]]
- definite MS require documentation of two or more episodes of symptoms and two or more signs that reflect pathology in anatomically noncontiguous white matter tracts of the CNS
- Symptoms must last for >24 h and occur as distinct episodes that are separated by a month or more 
- If clinically only 1/2 signs on neurological examination the second may be documented by abnormal tests such as MRI or evoked potentials (EPs)
- the second clinical event (in time) may be supported solely by MRI findings, consisting of either the development of new focal white matter lesions on MRI or the simultaneous presence of both an enhancing lesion and a non-enhancing lesion in an asymptomatic location
- progressive from onset for ≥6 months without superimposed relapses, documentation of intrathecal IgG synthesis may be used to support a diagnosis of PPMS
# Diagnostic Tests 
## MRI 
- increase in vascular permeability from a breakdown of the BBB is detected by leakage of intravenous gadolinium (Gd) into parenchyma 
- leakage early in development of lesion and useful marker of inflammation 
- Gd enhancement typically persists for <1 month, and the residual MS plaque remains visible indefinitely as a focal area of hyperintensity (a lesion) on T2-weighted images 
- ***Dawson’s fingers***
	- Lesions are frequently oriented perpendicular to the ventricular surface, corresponding to the pathologic pattern of perivenous demyelination
- Lesions multifocal within the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. 
- Lesions >6 mm located in the ***corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord*** are particularly helpful diagnostically 
- bursts of focal inflammatory disease activity occur far more frequently than would have been predicted by the frequency of relapses. Thus, early in MS, most disease activity is clinically silent 
- ***“burden of disease”*** --> total volume of T2-weighted signal abnormality shows a significant (albeit weak) ***correlation with clinical disability.***
- ***Quantitative measures of brain and spinal cord atrophy*** are evidence of diffuse tissue injury and correlate more strongly with measures of disability or progressive MS
- Approximately one-third of T2-weighted lesions appear as ***hypointense lesions (black holes) on T1-weighted imaging.*** 
- Black holes may be a marker of irreversible demyelination and axonal loss 
## Evoked Potentials 
- assesses function in afferent (visual, auditory, and somatosensory) or efferent (motor) CNS pathways 
- use computer averaging to measure CNS electric potentials evoked by repetitive stimulation of selected peripheral nerves or of the brain
- provide the most information when the pathways studied are ***clinically uninvolved*** 
- EP abnormalities are ***not specific to MS,*** 
- marked ***delay in the latency*** of a specific EP component (as opposed to a reduced amplitude or distorted wave-shape) is suggestive of demyelination 
## CSF 
- ***mononuclear cell pleocytosis*** and an increased level of ***intrathecally synthesized IgG***
- total CSF protein is usually normal or mildly elevated 
- Measures of intrathecal IgG 
	- ***CSF IgG index*** expresses the ***ratio of IgG to albumin in the CSF divided by the same ratio in the serum.*** 
	- The ***IgG synthesis rate*** uses ***serum and CSF IgG and albumin measurements to calculate the rate of CNS IgG synthesis.*** 
	- measurement of ***oligoclonal bands (OCBs)*** by agarose gel electrophoresis in the CSF
- OCBs may be absent at the onset of MS, and in individual patients, the number of bands may increase with time
- mild CSF pleocytosis (>5 cells/μL) is present in ~25% of cases, usually in young patients with RMS 
- Features suggesting not MS 
	- pleocytosis of >75 cells/μL, 
	- the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or 
	- a protein concentration >1 g/L (>100 mg/dL) in CSF
# Differential Diagnosis 
- ![[MSdifferentials.png]]
- possibility should be considered when 
	- symptoms are localized exclusively to the posterior fossa, craniocervical junction, or spinal cord; 
	- the patient is <15 or >60 years of age; 
	- clinical course is progressive from onset 
	- patient has never experienced visual, sensory, or bladder symptoms 
	- laboratory findings (e.g., MRI, CSF, or EPs) are atypical
- Uncommon or rare symptoms should prompt alternate 
	- aphasia, 
	- parkinsonism, 
	- chorea, 
	- isolated dementia, 
	- severe muscular atrophy, 
	- peripheral neuropathy, 
	- episodic loss of consciousness, 
	- fever, 
	- headache, 
	- seizures 
	- coma
# Prognosis 
- long-term prognosis for MS has improved substantially in recent years, and transition from RMS to SPMS now occurs at approximately a 1% annual rate com- pared with 2–3% in the pretreatment era 
- favorable prognosis 
	- ON or sensory symptoms at onset; 
	- fewer than two relapses in the first year of illness; 
	- minimal impairment after 5 years
- aggressive markers 
	- older age at symptom onset and greater disability 
	- appearance of motor signs during the first year of the illness
- disability markers 
	- truncal ataxia, 
	- action tremor, 
	- pyramidal symptoms, or a 
	- progressive disease course
- benign MS 15 years after onset who have entirely normal neurologic examinations are likely to maintain their benign course. 
- 1st clinical attack 
	- With three or more typical T2-weighted lesions, the risk of developing MS after 20 years is ~80%. 
	- normal brain MRI, the likelihood of developing MS is <20%. 
	- two or more Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline is highly predictive of future MS 
	- the appearance of either new T2-weighted lesions or new Gd enhancement ≥3 months after the initial episode predictive of future MS 
- Effect on pregnancy 
	- less attacks than expected in pregnancy (especially last trimester)
	- more attacks than expected 3 months post partum 
	- overall through the year 9m+3m post partum, course unchanged 
	- pregnancy should be planned according to 
		- he mother’s physical state 
		- her ability to care for the child 
		- the availability of social support
	- Disease-modifying therapy is generally discontinued during pregnancy 
# Treatment 
- Categories 
	- acute attacks 
	- disease modifying agents 
	- symptomatic 
- EDSS (expanded disability status scale)
	- <3.5 can usually walk 
	- >4 have progressive MS 
- Acute Attack 
	- If new attack/ deterioration consider whether this change reflects new disease activity or a ***“pseudoexacerbation” resulting from an increase in ambient temperature, fever, or an infection***
	- Glucocorticoid inappropriate if pseudoexacerbation 
	- Glucocorticoid 
		- 1st attacks or exacerbation 
		- reducing the severity and shortening the duration of attacks 
		- long term effect unclear , so ***mild attacks usually not treated*** 
		- IV methylpred 500-1000mg/d x 3-5days 
		- maybe followed by no taper or oral prednisone 60-80mg/d tapered over 2 weeks 
		- side effects  include fluid retention, potassium loss, weight gain, gastric disturbances, acne, and emotional lability
		- Concurrent use of a low-salt, potassium-rich diet and avoidance of potassium-wasting diuretics
		- Lithium carbonate (300 mg orally bid) for emotional lability and insomnia 
		- if history of PUD, cimetidine 400BD, ranitidine 150BD 
		- PPI like pantoprazole 40 BD to prevent gastritis 
	- if unresponsive to steroids, and fulminant  plasma exchange  40-60ml/exchange and 5-7 exchanges 
## Disease Modifying Therapy 
- consider patients with recent relapses to be a “relapsing form of MS” regardless of whether these patients previously had progressive disability independent from relapses
# Frequent agents 

## Anti CD20 — highly effective 
- Ocrelizumab
	- humanized monoclonal antibody against CD20 on surface of ***mature B cells*** 
	- not expressed on early B-cell precursors or on antibody-producing plasma cells, so selectively depletes mature B cells

	- rapidly depletes circulating B cells through antibody-dependent cellular toxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity
	- Ocrelizumab 600 mg is administered by intravenous infusion every 24 weeks (administered as two 300-mg infusions spaced 2 weeks apart for the first dose, and as a single 600-mg infusion thereafter)
	- Iv methylpred 100mg before 
	- optional prophylaxis with analgesics/antipyretics and antihistamines is recommended 
	- Vaccination responses may be blunted in patients receiving ocrelizumab or other anti-CD20 based therapies

- associated with malignancy, including in the MS clinical trials, and for this reason is not recommended in treatment-naïve patients
- contraindicated in p nant women because it is a known teratogen in animals and can cause embryolethality 
- recommended to not plan conception for 6 months after the last dose
- complete blood count including lymphocyte count and liver function tests; be screened for HIV, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B and C; be vaccinated for varicella zoster virus; and undergo a brain MRI within 3 months of treatment
## ALEMTUZUMAB (HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
- humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen that is expressed on both monocytes and lymphocytes
- causes lymphocyte depletion (of both B and T cells)
- toxicities of concern 
    - autoimmune diseases including thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, antiglomerular basement membrane disease, and membranous glomerulonephritis
    - malignancies including thyroid cancer, melanoma, breast cancer, human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers, and lymphoproliferative disorders including lymphoma
    - serious infections
    - infusion reactions.
- only in patients who have tried and failed at least two other DMTs.
## MITOXANTRONE HYDROCHLORIDE (HIGHLY EFFECTIVE)
- anthracenedione
- antineoplastic action by 
    - intercalating into DNA and producing both strand breaks and interstrand cross-links
    - interfering with RNA synthesis
    - inhibiting topoisomerase II (involved in DNA repair)
- in patients with rapidly worsening MS (defined as patients whose neurologic status remains significantly abnormal between MS attacks) 
- cardiotoxic (e.g., cardiomyopathy, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and irreversible congestive heart failure) 
- cumulative dose >140 mg/m 2is not recommended
- approved doses (12 mg/m 2every 3 months), the maximum duration of therapy can be only 2–3 years
- >40% of women will experience amenorrhea, which may be permanent
- risk of acute leukemia from mitoxantrone 
# DECISION-MAKING FOR TREATMENT OF RMS
- First-line therapy should be initiated in patients with a clinically isolated syndrome at high risk for MS or in patients diagnosed with RMS (according to 2017 McDonald criteria)
- favor use of the most highly effective DMTs as first-line options
- “treat to target” approach in which a treatment of modest or moderate effectiveness is first used, and therapy advanced to a more effective agent when breakthrough disease (evident clinically or by MRI)
- begin with an anti-CD20 agent, either ocrelizumab or ofatumumab, or with natalizumab in JCV-negative patients
- patients who prefer oral treatment, either an S1P modulator or fumarate is also reasonable for first-line therapy
- Switching DMTs
    - suboptimal response, 
    - experiencing more than one relapse with active MRI scans while on treatment, and 
    - safety issues including development of persistent high-titer neutralizing antibodies in patients receiving IFN-β
    - women who become pregnant while on treatment
    - serious adverse events that may be drug-related
- glatiramer acetate that can be continued during pregnancy
- mild initial course—e.g., normal examination or minimal impairment (EDSS ≤2.5) and low disease activity by MRI—either an oral (fumarates, S1P modulators, teriflunomide) or injectable (IFN-β or glatiramer acetate) agent can be considered.
- safety and value of combination therapy is also largely unknown and is generally not recommended
- Delay treatment in 
    - normal neurologic examinations
    - a single attack or a low attack frequency
    - low burden of disease as assessed by brain MRI
- vitamin D deficiency should be corrected in all patients with MS
# DMTs for progressive MS
## SPMS
- Siponimod is a selective S1P1 S1P5 receptor modulator and reduced the risk of relapse and MRI measures of the burden of diseas
- relapse in the 2 years prior to treatment and those with contrast-enhancing lesions on brain MRI received the most therapeutic benefit
- dosed based on CYP2C9 genotype
- CYP2C9 1/* 3 or 2/* 3, siponimod is administered as 1 mg daily
- dosage is reduced in patients with the CYP2C9 * 3/* 3 genotype
- complete blood count, o mic evaluation, electrocardiogram, liver function tests, and vaccination for varicella zoster virus. 
- first-dose monitoring is required only in patients with sinus bradycardia, first- or second-degree heart block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure
- Ocrelizumab, cladribine, and ponesimod are also indicated in active SPMS
- IFN-β is probably ineffective in patients with SPMS who do not have active disease
## PPMS
- Ocrelizumab
- improve other clinical and MRI markers of inflammatory and degenerative disease activity 
## OFF-LABEL TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR RMS AND SPMS
- Azathioprine (2–3 mg/kg per day) has been used primarily in relapsing MS.
- Methotrexate (7.5–20 mg/week) was shown in one study to slow the progression of upper-extremity dysfunction in SPMS but blind liver biopsy recommended after 2 years of therapy
- Cyclophosphamide (700 mg/m2, every other month) may be helpful for treatment-refractory patients who are (1) otherwise in good health, (2) ambulatory, and (3) <40 years of age
- Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), administered in monthly pulses (up to 1 g/kg) for up to 2 years, appears to reduce annual exacerbation rates.
- Methylprednisolone in one study, administered as monthly highdose intravenous pulses, reduced disability progression
- Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation appears to be highly effective in reducing the occurrence of relapses and may improve disability in relapsing MS. It appears to be ineffective for patients with progressive MS
# Symptomatic Therapy
- Ataxia/tremor is often intractable. Clonazepam, 1.5–20 mg/d; primidone, 50–250 mg/d; propranolol, 40–200 mg/d; or ondansetron, 8–16 mg/d, may help
- Spasticity and spasms may improve with physical therapy, regular exercise, and stretching medications include baclofen (20–120 mg/d), diazepam (2–40 mg/d), tizanidine (8–32 mg/d), dantrolene (25–400 mg/d), and cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (10–60 mg/d)
- Weakness potassium channel blockers such as 4-aminopyridine (20 mg/d) and 3,4-di-aminopyridine (40–80 mg/d)
- Pain is treated with anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, 100–1000 mg/d; phenytoin, 300–600 mg/d; gabapentin, 300–3600 mg/d; or pregabalin, 50–300 mg/d), antidepressants (amitriptyline, 25–150 mg/d; nortriptyline, 25–150 mg/d; desipramine, 100–300 mg/d; or venlafaxine, 75–225 mg/d), or antiarrhythmics (mexiletine, 300–900 mg/d)
- Evening fluid restriction or frequent voluntary voiding may help detrusor hyperreflexia. If these methods fail, propantheline bromide (10–15 mg/d), oxybutynin (5–15 mg/d), hyoscyamine sulfate (0.5–0.75 mg/d), tolterodine tartrate (2–4 mg/d), or solifenacin (5–10 mg/d) may help. Coadministration of pseudoephedrine (30–60 mg) is sometimes beneficial.
- Detrusor/sphincter dyssynergia may respond to phenoxybenzamine (10–20 mg/d) or terazosin hydrochloride (1–20 mg/d). Loss of reflex bladder wall contraction may respond to bethanechol (30–150 mg/d).
- Depression selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, 20–80 mg/d, or sertraline, 50–200 mg/d), the tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, 25–150 mg/d; nortriptyline, 25–150 mg/d; or desipramine, 100–300 mg/d), and the nontricyclic antidepressants (venlafaxine, 75–225 mg/d)
- Excessive daytime somnolence caused by MS may respond to amantadine (200 mg/d), methylphenidate (5–25 mg/d), modafinil (100–400 mg/d), or armodafinil (150–250 mg/d)
- Cognitive problems may respond marginally to lisdexamfetamine (40 mg/d).
- Paroxysmal symptoms respond dramatically to low-dose anticonvulsants (acetazolamide, 200–600 mg/d; carbamazepine, 50–400 mg/d; phenytoin, 50–300 mg/d; or gabapentin, 600–1800 mg/d).
# Variants
- Acute MS (Marburg’s variant) 
    - fulminant demyelinating process that in some cases progresses inexorably to death within 1–2 years.
    - Typically, there are no remissions.
    - does not seem to follow infection or vaccination 
- Tumefactive MS 
    - acute demyelinating syndrome presents as a solitary expansile lesion, a brain tumor is often suspected
    - Brain biopsy to establish the diagnosis
- Balo’s concentric sclerosis 
    - fulminant demyelinating syndrome characterized by concentric brain or spinal cord lesions with alternating spheres of demyelination and remyelination
# ACUTE DISSEMINATED ENCEPHALOMYELITIS (ADEM)
- monophasic course 
- frequently associated with an antecedent infection (postinfectious encephalomyelitis)
- 5% follow immunisation
- common in children than adults,
- presence of widely scattered foci of perivenular i mation and demyelination that can involve both white matter and grey matter structures, in contrast to larger confluent white matter lesions typical of MS
- most explosive form of ADEM, acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, the lesions are vasculitic and hemorrhagic, and the clinical course is devastating
- frequently associated with the viral exanthems of childhood
- rarely follows vaccination with live measles vaccine
- most frequently associated with varicella (chickenpox) infections
- result from a cross-reactive immune response to the infectious agent or vaccine that then triggers an inflammatory demyelinating response.
- Autoantibodies to MBP and to other myelin antigens have been detected in the CSF
- Clinical 
    - abrupt and progression rapid (hours to days).
    - neurologic syndrome generally begins late in the course of the viral illness as the exanthem is fading
    - Fever reappears, and headache, meningismus, and lethargy progressing to coma may develop.
    - Seizures common
    - Signs of disseminated neurologic disease are consistently present (e.g., hemiparesis or quadriparesis, extensor plantar responses, lost or hyperactive tendon reflexes, sensory loss, and brainstem involvement) 
    - chickenpox, cerebellar involvement is often conspicuous
    - CSF protein is modestly elevated (0.5–1.5 g/L 50–150 mg/dL). Lymphocytic pleocytosis, generally ≥200 cells/μL
    - Transient CSF oligoclonal banding has been reported.
    - MRI usually reveals extensive changes in the brain and spinal cord, consisting of white matter hyperintensities on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences with Gd enhancement on T1-weighted sequence
- Diagnosis
    - reliably established when there is a history of recent vaccination or viral exanthematous illness
    - infection with herpes simplex or other viruses including HIV may be difficult to exclude
    - hypercoagulable states including the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, autoimmune (paraneoplastic) limbic encephalitis, vasculitis, neurosarcoid, primary CNS lymphoma, or metastatic cancer considered
    -  is common in ADEM and rare in MS

## Treatment
- high-dose glucocorticoids; depending on the response, treatment may need to be continued for 8 week
- fail to respond within a few days may benefit from a course of plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin
# GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN (GFAP) AUTOIMMUNITY
- Autoimmunity against the astrocyte protein GFAP 
- presents with a range of symptoms referable to meningismus, encephalitis, myelitis, and optic neuritis
- characteristic patterns of gadolinium enhancement localized to GFAP-enriched CNS regions including venous structures in a periventricular radial orientation, the leptomeninges, the peri-ependymal spinal cord, and a striking serpiginous pattern involving brain parenchyma
- Differential is neurosarcoid 
- lymphocytic pleocytosis is commonly present in the CSF. 
- Antibodies against GFAP can be measured in the CSF or serum
- paraneoplastic syndrome in 25% of case, mostly ovarian teratoma,
- coexist with anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD
- generally glucocorticoid responsive

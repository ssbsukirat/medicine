- autoimmune disease of CNS characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, gliosis (plaques or scarring), and neuronal loss
- can be relapsing or progressive 
- plaques typically develop at different times and in different CNS locations (i.e., MS is said to be ***disseminated in time and space)***
# Clinical 
- abrupt or insidious onset 
- may be severe or seem so trivial that a patient may not seek medical attention for months or years 
- Examination often reveals evidence of neurologic dysfunction, often in asymptomatic locations 
- Sensory 
	- include both ***paresthesias*** (e.g., tingling, prickling sensations, formications, “pins and needles,” or painful burning) and ***hypesthesia*** (e.g., reduced sensation, numbness, or a “dead” feeling)
	- Unpleasant sensations (e.g., feelings that body parts are swollen, wet, raw, or tightly wrapped) are also common 
	- ***sensory level*** Sensory impairment of the trunk and legs below a horizontal line on the torso indicates that the spinal cord is the origin of the disturbance and accompanied by ***bandlike sensation*** or tightness around torso 
	- Pain common and in >50% 
- Optic Neuritis 
	- diminished visual acuity, dimness, or decreased color perception (desaturation) in the central field of vision

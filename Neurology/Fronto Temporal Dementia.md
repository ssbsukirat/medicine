- group of clinical syndromes united by their links to underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology 
- disease of abnormal protein aggregation, with either tau or transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) 
- m>f 
# Clinical 
- 3 variants -- behavioral , semantic PPA , nonfluent PPA 
- Behavioural FTD (bvFTD)
	- most common 
	- social and emotional dysfunction 
	- manifests as apathy, disinhibition, compulsivity, loss of empathy, and overeating, 
	- accompanied by deficits in executive control 
	- associated with motor neuron disease 
	- Degeneration with atrophy occurs in the medial and orbital frontal and anterior insula 
- Semantic Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA)
	- slowly lose the ability to decode word, object, person-specific, and emotion meaning 
	- anterior temporal region degeneration with atrophy 
- Nonfluent / Agrammatic PPA 
	- profound inability to produce words, often with prominent motor speech impairment 
	- lateral frontal and precentral gyrus of the dominant hemisphere degeneration 
- if associated with MND, FTD-MND 
- the corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy–Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) can be considered part of the FTLD clinical spectrum
- parietal functions such as visuospatial processing and arithmetic calculations are unaffected even late
# Genetics 
- Autosomal Dominant 
	- ***C9orf72*** (chromosome 9) exanucleotide (***GGGGCC***) expansion in a noncoding exon
	- ***GRN*** (chromosome 17)
	- ***MAPT*** (chromosome 17) genes
- MAPT and GRN mutations are associated with parkinsonian features, whereas ALS is rare 
# Neuropathology 
- focal atrophy of frontal, insular, and/or temporal cortex on imaging 
- atrophy often begins focally in one hemisphere before spreading to anatomically interconnected cortical and subcortical regions
- Loss of cortical serotonergic innervation 
- cholinergic system is relatively spared in FTD (achE inhibitors less useful )
- Microscopic gliosis, microvacuolation, and neuronal loss 
- contain either tau or TDP-43 in ~90% of patients, with the remaining ~10% showing inclusions containing the FET family of proteins (FUS, Ewing sarcoma protein, TAF-15) 
# Pathogenesis 
- toxicity and spreading capacity of misfolded tau are critical for the pathogenesis 
- TDP-43 and FUS are RNA/DNA binding proteins with unclear function 
- loss of TDP-43 function results in mis-splicing events leading to mRNA degradation 
- misfolded proteins have “prion-like” properties and creates exponential amplification of protein misfolding within a cell

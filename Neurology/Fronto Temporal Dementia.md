- group of clinical syndromes united by their links to underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology 
- disease of abnormal protein aggregation, with either tau or transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) 
- m>f 
# Clinical 
- 3 variants -- behavioral , semantic PPA , nonfluent PPA 
- Behavioural FTD (bvFTD)
	- most common 
	- social and emotional dysfunction 
	- manifests as apathy, disinhibition, compulsivity, loss of empathy, and overeating, 
	- accompanied by deficits in executive control 
	- associated with motor neuron disease 
	- Degeneration with atrophy occurs in the medial and orbital frontal and anterior insula 
- Semantic Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA)
	- slowly lose the ability to decode word, object, person-specific, and emotion meaning 
	- anterior temporal region degeneration with atrophy 
- Nonfluent / Agrammatic PPA 
	- profound inability to produce words, often with prominent motor speech impairment 
	- lateral frontal and precentral gyrus of the dominant hemisphere degeneration 
- if associated with MND, FTD-MND 
- the corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy–Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) can be considered part of the FTLD clinical spectrum
- parietal functions such as visuospatial processing and arithmetic calculations are unaffected even late
# Genetics 
- Autosomal Dominant 
	- ***C9orf72*** (chromosome 9) exanucleotide (***GGGGCC***) expansion in a noncoding exon
	- ***GRN*** (chromosome 17)
	- ***MAPT*** (chromosome 17) genes
- MAPT and GRN mutations are associated with parkinsonian features, whereas ALS is rare 
# Neuropathology 
- focal atrophy of frontal, insular, and/or temporal cortex on imaging 
- atrophy often begins focally in one hemisphere before spreading to anatomically interconnected cortical and subcortical regions
- Loss of cortical serotonergic innervation 
- cholinergic system is relatively spared in FTD (achE inhibitors less useful )
- Microscopic gliosis, microvacuolation, and neuronal loss 
- contain either tau or TDP-43 in ~90% of patients, with the remaining ~10% showing inclusions containing the FET family of proteins (FUS, Ewing sarcoma protein, TAF-15) 
# Pathogenesis 
- toxicity and spreading capacity of misfolded tau are critical for the pathogenesis 
- TDP-43 and FUS are RNA/DNA binding proteins with unclear function 
- loss of TDP-43 function results in mis-splicing events leading to mRNA degradation 
- misfolded proteins have “prion-like” properties and creates exponential amplification of protein misfolding within a cell 
- Picks Disease 
	- once used to describe a progressive degenerative disorder characterized by selective involvement of the anterior frontal and temporal neocortex and pathologically by intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (Pick bodies)
	- now used only in reference to a specific FTLD-tau histopathologic subtype 
	- Pick bodies are argyrophilic, staining positively with the Bielschowsky silver method (but not with the Gallyas method) and also with immunostaining for hyperphosphorylated tau 
# Treatment 
- Symptomatic 
- no therapies known to slow progression or improve symptoms 
- behaviors that may accompany FTD, such as depression, hyperorality, compulsions, and irritability, can be ameliorated with antidepressants, especially SSRIs 
- often accompanied by parkinsonism, antipsychotics, which can exacerbate this problem, must be used with caution. 
# Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Syndrome 
- degenerative disorder that involves the brainstem, basal ganglia, diencephalon, and selected areas of cortex 
- begins with falls and executive or subtle personality changes (such as mental rigidity, impulsivity, or apathy) 
- progressive oculomotor syndrome ensues
	- begins with square wave jerks, 
	- followed by slowed saccades (vertical worse than horizontal) 
	- resulting in progressive supranuclear ophthalmoparesis
- Dysarthria, dysphagia, and symmetric axial rigidity 
- stiff, unstable posture with hyperextension of the neck and a slow, jerky, toppling gait
- Frequent unexplained and sometimes spectacular falls are common secondary to a combination of axial rigidity, inability to look down, and impaired judgment
- retain oculocephalic reflexes (demonstrated using a vertical doll’s head maneuver)
- oculomotor disorder is supranuclear
- overlaps with bvFTD, featuring apathy, frontal-executive dysfunction, poor judgment, slowed thought processes, impaired verbal fluency, and difficulty with sequential actions and with shifting from one task to another
- Response to l-dopa is limited or absent; no other treatments exist
- Death in 5-10 years
- PSP is used to refer to a specific histopathologic entity within the FTLD-tau class
- accumulation of hyperphosphorylated 4-repeat tau is seen within neurons and glia
- inclusions often appear tangle-like and may be large, spherical (“globose”) and coarse in subcortical and brainstem structures
- involvement is in the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray, tectum, oculomotor nuclei, pontine nuclei, and dentate nucleus of cerebellum.
- prominent tau-positive glial inclusions, such as tufted astrocytes coiled oligodendroglial inclusions (“coiled bodies”), or, least often, thorny astrocytes
- often confused with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD)
    - PD may have restricted upgaze, they do not develop downgaze paresis or other abnormalities of voluntary eye movements typical of PSP 
    - Dementia in PD becomes more likely with increasing age, increasing severity of extrapyramidal signs, long disease duration, and the presence of depression.
# CORTICOBASAL SYNDROME
- slowly progressive dementia-movement disorder associated with severe degeneration in the perirolandic cortex and basal ganglia (substantia nigra and striatopallidum)
- present with asymmetric rigidity, dystonia, myoclonus, and apraxia
- progressively incapacitated limb, 
- ***alien limb phenomena*** in which the limb exhibits unintended motor actions such as grasping, groping, drifting, or undoing.
- Eventually bilateral 
- dysarthria, slow gait, action tremor, and a frontal-predominant dementia
- CBD refers to a specific histopathological FTLD-tau entity
- microscopic features include ballooned, achromatic, tau-positive neurons; astrocytic plaques
- CBD features a severe tauopathy burden in the subcortical white matter

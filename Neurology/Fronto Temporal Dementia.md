- group of clinical syndromes united by their links to underlying frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology 
- disease of abnormal protein aggregation, with either tau or transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) 
- m>f 
# Clinical 
- 3 variants -- behavioral , semantic PPA , nonfluent PPA 
- Behavioural FTD (bvFTD)
	- most common 
	- social and emotional dysfunction 
	- manifests as apathy, disinhibition, compulsivity, loss of empathy, and overeating, 
	- accompanied by deficits in executive control 
	- associated with motor neuron disease 
	- Degeneration with atrophy occurs in the medial and orbital frontal and anterior insula 
- Semantic Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA)
	- slowly lose the ability to decode word, object, person-specific, and emotion meaning 
	- anterior temporal region degeneration with atrophy 
- Nonfluent / Agrammatic PPA 
	- profound inability to produce words, often with prominent motor speech impairment 
	- lateral frontal and precentral gyrus of the dominant hemisphere degeneration 
- if associated with MND, FTD-MND 
- the corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsyâ€“Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS) can be considered part of the FTLD clinical spectrum
- parietal functions such as visuospatial processing and arithmetic calculations are unaffected even late

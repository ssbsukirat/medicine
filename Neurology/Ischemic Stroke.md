# Pathophysiology and Core Concepts of Ischemic Stroke

## Definition and Ischemia Thresholds

- Acute occlusion of an intracranial vessel causes a reduction in blood flow to the supplied brain region.
- The magnitude of flow reduction depends on collateral blood flow, individual vascular anatomy, the site of occlusion, and systemic blood pressure.
- Cessation of flow leads to brain tissue death (infarction) within 4–10 minutes.
- Blood flow values <16–18 mL/100 g tissue per minute cause infarction within an hour.
- Blood flow values <20 mL/100 g tissue per minute cause ischemia without infarction, unless prolonged for several hours or days.
- If blood flow is restored before significant infarction, symptoms may be transient (Transient Ischemic Attack, TIA).

## The Ischemic Penumbra

- The penumbra is defined as **ischemic but reversibly dysfunctional tissue** surrounding a core area of infarction.
- This tissue will eventually progress to infarction if flow is not restored.
- Saving the ischemic penumbra is the goal of revascularization therapies.
- The penumbra can be imaged using perfusion techniques via MRI or CT.

## Mechanisms of Cell Death

- Focal cerebral infarction occurs via two pathways:
    - **Necrotic pathway:** Rapid cellular cytoskeletal breakdown due primarily to energy failure.
        - Ischemia starves neurons of glucose and oxygen, causing mitochondria to fail ATP production.
        - Membrane ion pumps stop, neurons depolarize, and intracellular calcium rises.
        - Excess extracellular glutamate is released, activating postsynaptic receptors and increasing neurotoxicity via calcium influx.
    - **Apoptotic pathway:** Cells become programmed to die days to weeks later. Favored by lesser degrees of ischemia, such as those seen within the ischemic penumbra.
- Ischemia also causes injury or destruction of axons, dendrites, and glia.
- Free radicals, produced by degradation of membrane lipids and mitochondrial dysfunction, cause catalytic destruction of membranes.
- Fever and hyperglycemia (glucose >11.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]) dramatically worsen brain injury.

# Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment and Management

## Initial Priorities and Diagnosis

- Once stroke is suspected, the first priorities are to assess airway and blood pressure (ABCs).
- Establish the time last seen normal (onset time).
- Treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified.
- Perform an emergency noncontrast head CT scan to differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
    - No reliable clinical findings conclusively separate ischemia from hemorrhage.
- Patients with disabling neurologic deficits (especially NIHSS >5) may be eligible for thrombolytic or endovascular therapy.

## Medical Support

- The immediate goal is to optimize cerebral perfusion in the surrounding ischemic penumbra.
- Prevent common complications in bedridden patients, such as infections (pneumonia, urinary, skin) and Deep-Venous Thrombosis (DVT) with Pulmonary Embolism (PE).
- Subcutaneous heparin (unfractionated and low-molecular-weight) is safe and may be used concomitantly.
- Pneumatic compression stockings are safe and of proven benefit in reducing DVT risk.
- **Blood Pressure (BP) Management:**
    - Permissive hypertension is allowed for the first few weeks to help collateral flow.
    - Routine BP lowering below certain limits has the potential to worsen outcomes.
    - BP should be reduced if it exceeds 220/120 mmHg.
    - BP must be lowered to <185/110 mmHg if thrombolytic therapy is anticipated.
    - BP should also be reduced if malignant hypertension or concomitant myocardial ischemia exists.
    - Lowering the heart rate with a $\beta_1$-adrenergic blocker (e.g., esmolol) may be a first step if facing competing demands of myocardium and brain.
- **Temperature and Glucose Control:**
    - Fever is detrimental and should be treated with antipyretics and surface cooling.
    - Serum glucose should be monitored and kept <10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) and above at least 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL).
- **Cerebral Edema:**
    - Edema peaks on the second or third day, potentially lasting $\sim 10$ days.
    - Water restriction and IV mannitol may be used to raise serum osmolarity, but hypovolemia must be avoided.
    - **Hemicraniectomy** reduces mortality by 50% and improves clinical outcomes for survivors of large infarcts. The size of the acute diffusion-weighted imaging volume predicts future deterioration requiring surgery. Older patients (>60 years) benefit less but still significantly.
- **Cerebellar Infarction:**
    - Strokes here may mimic labyrinthitis. Head or neck pain should suggest cerebellar stroke due to vertebral artery dissection.
    - Swelling can acutely increase Intracranial Pressure (ICP) by obstructing CSF flow (hydrocephalus) or compressing the brainstem.
    - Brainstem compression can cause coma and respiratory arrest.
    - Emergency suboccipital decompression is recommended for neurologic deterioration before significant brainstem compression occurs.

## IV Thrombolysis

- IV rtPA is the first treatment proven to improve clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke.
- The NINDS study showed benefit for rtPA (0.9 mg/kg max 90 mg) in selected patients within 3 h of onset.
- IV rtPA improved the number of patients with minimal disability by 12% absolute increase, despite a 6.4% symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate (versus 0.6% placebo).
- Efficacy is confirmed in the <3-h time window, and likely extends to 4.5 h.
- The ECASS III trial confirmed efficacy in the 3- to 4.5-h window, though treatment effect was less robust (OR 1.34). Patients >80 years and diabetics with previous stroke were excluded from ECASS III.
- rtPA is approved for 0–3 h in the U.S. and 3–4.5 h in Europe and Canada.
- Advanced neuroimaging may help select patients for thrombolysis beyond 4.5 h.
- **Tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 5 s):** Used by some centers as an alternative to rtPA because it does not require a 1-h infusion, easing transport to comprehensive centers. Found safe prior to endovascular therapy.

## Endovascular Revascularization

- Used for Ischemic Stroke (IS) from **large-vessel intracranial occlusion** (MCA, ICA, basilar artery) which often fail IV rtPA.
- Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy improved clinical outcomes for ICA and MCA occlusions <6 h from onset.
- Combined meta-analysis confirmed a large benefit (OR 2.49); 46% of the endovascular group achieved a good outcome (mRS 0–2).
- Clinical outcome is dependent on time: odds of good outcome exceed 3 if groin puncture occurs within 2 h.
- The time window can be extended beyond 6 h (up to 24 h) if imaging demonstrates good vascular collaterals (penumbra/mismatch).
    - DAWN trial and DEFUSE-3 trial confirmed good outcomes with endovascular therapy up to 16 h from stroke onset.
- Thrombectomy for basilar occlusion has been found safe up to 24 h from symptom onset.
- Outcomes are likely improved if preceded by IV rtPA treatment when eligible.

## Acute Antithrombotic Treatment

- **Aspirin** is the only antiplatelet agent proven effective for acute IS treatment.
- Use of aspirin within 48 h of stroke onset reduced recurrent stroke risk and mortality minimally.
- Trials (IST and CAST) showed aspirin (160 mg/d to 300 mg/d) is safe and produces a small net benefit. Treating 1000 acute strokes prevents $\sim 9$ deaths or nonfatal stroke recurrences in the first few weeks.
- **Routine anticoagulation** (heparin or others) is not warranted for primary treatment of atherothrombotic cerebral ischemia, as trials failed to show benefit and showed increased risk of hemorrhage.
- Anticoagulation may be beneficial for halting progression of dural sinus thrombosis.

# Etiology of Ischemic Stroke

## Major Mechanisms

- **Occlusion by Embolus:** From cardiogenic sources (e.g., AF) or artery-to-artery emboli (e.g., carotid plaque); typically affects large vessels.
- **In situ Thrombosis:** Typically affects small penetrating arteries arising from major intracranial arteries.
- **Hypoperfusion:** Caused by flow-limiting stenosis of a major vessel, often producing "watershed" ischemia.

## Cardioembolic Stroke (∼20% of IS)

- Caused by embolism of thrombotic material from the heart (atrial/ventricular wall or valves).
- Tend to occur suddenly with maximum deficit at onset.
- Emboli most often lodge in the intracranial ICA, MCA, PCA, or their branches.
- **Key Causes:**
    - **Nonrheumatic Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF):** The most common cause overall. Thrombus forms in the atrium/atrial appendage. Average annual stroke risk is $\sim 5%$. Risk estimated by the CHA2DS2-VASc score.
    - **Recent Myocardial Infarction (MI):** Source of emboli, especially with transmural or anteroapical ventricular wall involvement.
    - **Rheumatic Heart Disease:** Associated with mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation.
- **Paradoxical Embolization:** Venous thrombi migrate to arterial circulation, usually via a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) or Atrial Septal Defect.
    - Confirmed using bubble-contrast echocardiography or Transcranial Doppler.
    - PFO closure with percutaneous devices reduces recurrent stroke risk in patients with no other explanation for stroke.
- **Bacterial Endocarditis:** Source of septic emboli/valvular vegetations. May cause multifocal symptoms or large septic infarcts (potentially evolving into abscesses or hemorrhage, precluding anticoagulation).

## Artery-to-Artery Embolic Stroke

- Caused by thrombus forming on atherosclerotic plaques and embolizing.
- Any diseased vessel may be a source (aortic arch, common/internal carotid, vertebral, basilar arteries).
- **Carotid Atherosclerosis:** Accounts for $\sim 10%$ of IS. Most frequent location is the common carotid bifurcation and proximal ICA. Risk factors include older age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.
    - Symptomatic stenosis carries a greater risk of subsequent stroke than asymptomatic stenosis.
- **Intracranial Atherosclerosis:** More common in patients of Asian and African-American descent. Causes stroke by embolism or _in situ_ thrombosis. Recurrent stroke risk is $\sim 15%$ per year.
- **Arterial Dissection (ICA/Vertebral):** Common source in young patients (<60 years). Usually painful. Extracranial dissections do not cause hemorrhage; intracranial dissections may cause SAH. Cause is often unknown, and recurrence is rare.

## Small-Vessel Stroke (Lacunar Infarction)

- **Prevalence:** Accounts for $\sim 20%$ of all strokes.
- **Pathophysiology:** Occlusion of small penetrating arteries (30–300 $\mu$m branches) by atherothrombotic disease or lipohyalinotic thickening. Infarcts (lacunes) range from 3 mm to 2 cm.
- **Risk Factors:** Hypertension and age.
- **Clinical Syndromes (Most Common):**
    - Pure motor hemiparesis (infarct in posterior internal capsule or pons).
    - Pure sensory stroke (infarct in ventral thalamus).
    - Ataxic hemiparesis (infarct in ventral pons or internal capsule).
    - Dysarthria and a clumsy hand/arm (infarction in ventral pons or genu of internal capsule).
- **Prognosis:** Recovery tends to be more rapid and complete than large-vessel strokes.

## Less Common Causes

- **Hypercoagulable Disorders:** Increase risk of cortical vein or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Examples include antiphospholipid syndrome (requires long-term anticoagulation) and homocysteinemia.
- **Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis:** Associated with oral contraceptive use, pregnancy/postpartum, infection, dehydration, and laboratory-confirmed thrombophilia. Diagnosis is via MR or CT venography. Treatment involves IV heparin, even with hemorrhage, followed by oral anticoagulants.
- **Sickle Cell Anemia (SS disease):** Common cause in children. Predicted by high-velocity blood flow in MCAs (TCD). Treated with aggressive exchange transfusion.
- **Vasculopathies:**
    - **Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis:** Affects elderly, involves external carotid system. Causes blindness (occlusion of posterior ciliary arteries), preventable with glucocorticoids. Rarely causes stroke.
    - **Necrotizing/Granulomatous Arteritis (Primary CNS Vasculitis):** Involves distal small branches (<2 mm) and causes small ischemic infarcts. Requires brain biopsy or angiography for diagnosis. Treatment is aggressive immunosuppression.
- **Moyamoya Disease:** Occlusive disease of large intracranial arteries (distal ICA, MCA/ACA stem). Characterized by collateral circulation development ("puff of smoke"). Anticoagulation is risky due to hemorrhage potential.
- **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES):** Associated with hypertension/hyperperfusion states. Presents with headache and fluctuating visual symptoms. MRI shows edema (often occipital) that typically reverses completely.
- **Leukoaraiosis (White Matter Disease):** Result of multiple small-vessel infarcts due to lipohyalinosis caused by chronic hypertension. Associated with subcortical dementia.
- **CADASIL:** Inherited disorder (Notch-3 mutation) causing small-vessel strokes, progressive dementia, and symmetric white matter changes.

# Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs)

## Definition and Risk

- TIAs are stroke symptoms lasting briefly (standard definition <24 h, most <1 h).
- If infarction is identified on imaging, the event is classified as stroke, regardless of symptom duration.
- The risk of subsequent stroke after TIA is high: $\sim 10–15%$ in the first 3 months, with most occurring in the first 2 days.
- Risk can be estimated using the ABCD2 score.

## Treatment

- Improvement characteristic of TIA is a contraindication to thrombolysis.
- Urgent evaluation and treatment are justified.
- The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet therapy) prevents subsequent stroke better than aspirin alone following TIA or minor ischemic stroke.
- Ticagrelor combined with aspirin also showed benefit and is favored over clopidogrel because its effect is not limited by common genetic polymorphisms (CYP2C19).
- Dual antiplatelet regimen (Aspirin + Clopidogrel/Ticagrelor) should be administered for the first 21–90 days, followed by monotherapy.

# Primary and Secondary Stroke Prevention

## General Principles and Risk Factor Modification

- Identification and control of modifiable risk factors (Table 427-4) is the best strategy to reduce stroke burden.
- **Hypertension:** The most significant risk factor. Should be treated to a target of <130/80 mmHg. Lowering systolic BP $<120$ mmHg reduces stroke and heart attack by 43% compared to $<140$ mmHg. Thiazide diuretics and ACE inhibitors are strongly supported.
- **Statins:** Reduce risk of stroke, even in patients without typical lipid abnormalities.
    - SPARCL trial showed secondary prevention benefit with atorvastatin, 80 mg/d.
    - Target serum LDL $<70$ mg/dL lowers recurrent stroke risk.
    - A statin should be considered for all patients with prior ischemic stroke, unless the cause is nonatherothrombotic. PSK9 inhibitors can be used if statin intolerant.
- **Diabetes:** Prevention is likely the most effective strategy.
- **Smoking:** Should be discouraged.

## Antiplatelet Agents

- Reduce risk of nonfatal stroke by $\sim 25–30%$.
- Recommended for every patient with prior atherothrombotic stroke or TIA who lacks a contraindication or indication for anticoagulation.
- **Aspirin:** Inhibits thromboxane A2 formation irreversibly. Low doses (30–75 mg/d) achieve platelet effect without significantly inhibiting prostacyclin formation. Most North American physicians recommend 81–325 mg/d.
- **Clopidogrel/Ticagrelor:** Block the ADP receptor on platelets.
    - Clopidogrel alone was marginally more effective than aspirin in CAPRIE trial.
    - Long-term combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not recommended due to increased bleeding risk without improved prevention.
    - Short-term dual therapy (Aspirin + Clopidogrel or Aspirin + Ticagrelor) for 21–90 days is effective following TIA or minor stroke. Ticagrelor is preferred due to lack of genetic variation in efficacy.
- **Dipyridamole + Aspirin (Extended-release):** Combination is approved for stroke prevention. Shows efficacy superior to aspirin alone. Side effect is principally headache.

## Anticoagulation Therapy (Embolic Stroke Prevention)

- **Chronic Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation (NVAF):** Anticoagulation (VKA, target INR 2–3) reduces stroke risk by $\sim 67%$.
- **New Oral Anticoagulants (OACs):** Dabigatran (thrombin inhibitor) and factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) are often more convenient and efficacious than VKAs for stroke prevention in NVAF.
- The decision to use anticoagulation for primary prevention is based on risk factors (Table 427-3). A history of TIA or stroke favors anticoagulation.
- **Cryptogenic Stroke:** Ambulatory monitoring for 3–4 weeks is a reasonable strategy to detect intermittent AF.
- **Noncardiogenic Stroke:** Data do not support long-term VKAs for preventing atherothrombotic stroke. Exceptions include antiphospholipid syndrome (warfarin INR 2–3) and cancer-associated stroke (apixaban).

## Carotid Atherosclerosis Treatment

- Carotid disease can be treated surgically (endarterectomy) or with endovascular stenting.
- **Surgical Therapy (CEA):**
    - **Symptomatic Stenosis:** Substantial benefit for stenosis $\geq 70%$. A 17% absolute risk reduction favoring surgery was found in NASCET for $\geq 70%$ stenosis. Most beneficial when performed within 2 weeks of symptom onset.
    - **Asymptomatic Stenosis ($\geq 60%$):** ACAS and ACST trials showed a modest absolute risk reduction (5.4–5.9% over 5 years) compared to medical therapy alone. Medical therapy is generally recommended.
- **Endovascular Therapy (Stenting):**
    - SAPPHIRE (high-risk patients) showed stenting was comparable to CEA.
    - CREST found relative equivalence between stenting and CEA in lower-risk patients over 10 years, though stenting had higher 30-day stroke risk and CEA had higher 30-day MI risk.
- **Intracranial Atherosclerosis:** Aggressive medical management (antiplatelets, statins, BP control) is superior to intracranial stenting, which was found to be dramatically harmful in the SAMMPRIS trial.
- **PFO Closure:** Endovascular closure devices are recommended for patients with embolic stroke and PFO where no other cause is identified, offering a significant reduction in second stroke.

# Stroke Centers and Rehabilitation

## Stroke Centers

- Patient care in stroke units followed by rehabilitation improves neurologic outcomes and reduces mortality.
- Stroke teams that provide emergency 24-h evaluation are essential.
- Comprehensive stroke centers are designed to rapidly identify and treat large-vessel ischemia.
- Geographic systems of care, which triage patients to primary centers (for IV rtPA/tenecteplase) or comprehensive centers (for thrombectomy), are effective strategies.

## Rehabilitation

- Includes early physical, occupational, and speech therapy.
- Goal is to maximize recovery and prevent complications of immobility.
- Constrained movement therapy (immobilizing the unaffected side) improves hemiparesis even years after stroke.
- Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors may help prevent poststroke depression.
- Developing physical and pharmacologic strategies to enhance long-term neural recovery is an active research area.

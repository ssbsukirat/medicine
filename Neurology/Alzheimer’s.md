- Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, contributing to an estimated 60–70% of all cases
- can manifest as early as the third decade of life, but it is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly
- present with an insidious loss of episodic memory followed by a slowly progressive dementia 
- brain atrophy begins in the medial temporal lobes before spreading to the inferior temporal, lateral, medial parietal, and dorsolateral frontal cortices
- widespread neuritic plaques containing amyloid beta (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau filaments, and Aβ accumulation in blood vessel walls in cortex and leptomeninges (amyloid angiopathy)
- major genetic risk factor for AD is the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene
- one ε4 allele increases the risk for AD by twoto threefold in women whereas carrying two alleles increases the risk ten- to fifteenfold in both sexes
# clinical
- beginning with memory impairment and progressing to deficits in executive, language, and visuospatial functions
- ~20% of patients with AD present with nonmemory complaints such as word-finding, organizational, or navigational difficulty
- visual processing dysfunction (referred to as posterior cortical atrophy syndrome) or a progressive “logopenic” aphasia characterized by difficulties with naming and repetition are the primary manifestations
- asymmetric akinetic-rigid-dystonic (“corticobasal”) syndrome or a dysexecutive/ behavioral, i.e., “frontal” variant of AD.
- ***subjective cognitive decline*** refers to self-perceived worsening in memory or other cognitive abilities that may not be noticeable to others or apparent on formal neuropsychologic testing
- ***Mild cognitive impairment*** memory loss becomes noticeable to the patient and family and friends and is confirmed on standardized memory tests
- 50% of MCI progress to AD in 4 years
- replaced by the notion of “early symptomatic AD” to signify that AD is considered the underlying disease (based on clinical or biomarker evidence) in a patient who remains functionally compensated.
- preclinical AD” refers to a person with CSF or positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker evidence of amyloid pathology (with or without tau pathology) in the absence of symptoms.
- Preclinical may precede symptoms by 20 years 
- partial and sometimes generalized seizures herald AD and can occur even prior to dementia onset, especially in younger patients
- cognitive problems begin to interfere with daily activities, such as keeping track of finances, following instructions on the job, driving, shopping, and housekeeping. 
- Some patients are unaware of these difficulties (***anosognosia***), but most remain acutely attuned to their deficits in early disease stages
- Changes in environment (travel, relocation, hospitalization) tend to destabilize
- Middle stages 
    - unable to work, is easily lost and confused, and requires daily supervision
    - Language becomes impaired—***first naming, then comprehension, and finally fluency***
    - Apraxia emerges, manifesting as trouble performing learned sequential motor tasks such as using utensils or appliances.
    - Visuospatial deficits begin to interfere with dressing, eating, or even walking
- Late
    - some persons remain ambulatory, wandering aimlessly
    - Loss of judgment and reasoning
    - Delusions are prevalent and usually simple, with common themes of theft, infidelity, or misidentification
    - Disinhibition and uncharacteristic belligerence alternate with passivity and withdrawal
    - Sleep-wake patterns are disrupted, and nighttime wandering
    - shuffling gait with generalized muscle rigidity associated with slowness and awkwardness of movement
    - often look parkinsonian but rarely have a high-amplitude, low-frequency tremor at rest
- End 
    - rigid, mute, incontinent, and bedridden
    - need help with eating, dressing, and toileting
    - Hyperactive tendon reflexes and myoclonic jerks (sudden brief contractions of various muscles or the whole body) may occur spontaneously or in response to physical or auditory stimulation.
    - death results from malnutrition, secondary infections, pulmonary emboli, heart disease, or, ***most commonly, aspiration*** 
- typical duration of symptomatic AD is 8–10 years, but the course ranges from 1–25 years
# Diagnosis 
- Early in the disease course, other etiologies of dementia should be excluded 
- [[Dementia#causes of dementia]]
- Neuroimaging studies (CT and MRI) do not show a single specific pattern with AD and may be normal early in the disease.
- with progress usually ***posterior-predominant cortical atrophy*** becomes apparent, along with ***atrophy of the medial temporal memory structures***
- CT/MRI mainly to exclude secondary causes 
- Functional imaging studies, such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, reveal hypometabolism in the posterior temporal-parietal cortex in AD
- Amyloid PET imaging 
	- radiotracers (11C)PIB, (18F)florbetapir, (18F)florbetaben, or (18F)flutemetamol 
	- confirms the presence of neuritic and diffuse Aβ plaques throughout the neocortex
	- approximately 25% of cognitively unimpaired older individuals also have positive scans
	- ligands also bind to vascular Aβ deposits in ***cerebral amyloid angiopathy***
- Tau radiotracers 
	- (18F)flortuacipir, (18F)MK-6240
	- bind to the paired helical filaments that form NFTs 
	- binding is largely consistent with Braak neuropathologic staging of NFTs 
	- early retention in medial temporal regions, followed by spread into temporoparietal and cingu- late cortices, dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and, ultimately, primary sensory and motor areas 
- CSF 
	- generally normal 
	- reductions in Aβ42 levels and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio correlate with amyloid deposition 
	- increases in phosphorylated tau (at residue 181 or 217) correlate with tangle inclusions,
	- increases in total tau levels represent a nonspecific finding seen in AD but also in other causes of neurodegeneration
- EEG normal or nonspecific slowing 
- ***Slowly progressive decline in memory and orientation, normal results on laboratory tests, and an MRI or CT scan showing only distributed or posteriorly predominant cortical and hippocampal atrophy are highly suggestive of AD.*** 
- misdiagnoses due to limbic-predominant age- related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) neuropathologic changes with or without hippocampal sclerosis, primary age-related tauopa- thy, DLB, vascular pathology, or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD) 
# Epidemiology 
- positive family history of dementia suggests a genetic contribution to AD, which is usually attributable to the ApoE ε4 risk allele 
- Female sex is a risk factor independent 
- history of mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury increases the risk 
- environmental factors, including aluminum, mercury, and viruses, have been proposed as causes of AD 
- studies suggest that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents is associated with a decreased risk of AD

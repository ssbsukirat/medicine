- Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, contributing to an estimated 60–70% of all cases
- can manifest as early as the third decade of life, but it is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly
- present with an insidious loss of episodic memory followed by a slowly progressive dementia 
- brain atrophy begins in the medial temporal lobes before spreading to the inferior temporal, lateral, medial parietal, and dorsolateral frontal cortices
- widespread neuritic plaques containing amyloid beta (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau filaments, and Aβ accumulation in blood vessel walls in cortex and leptomeninges (amyloid angiopathy)
- major genetic risk factor for AD is the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene
- one ε4 allele increases the risk for AD by twoto threefold in women whereas carrying two alleles increases the risk ten- to fifteenfold in both sexes
# clinical
- beginning with memory impairment and progressing to deficits in executive, language, and visuospatial functions
- ~20% of patients with AD present with nonmemory complaints such as word-finding, organizational, or navigational difficulty
- visual processing dysfunction (referred to as posterior cortical atrophy syndrome) or a progressive “logopenic” aphasia characterized by difficulties with naming and repetition are the primary manifestations
- asymmetric akinetic-rigid-dystonic (“corticobasal”) syndrome or a dysexecutive/ behavioral, i.e., “frontal” variant of AD.
- ***subjective cognitive decline*** refers to self-perceived worsening in memory or other cognitive abilities that may not be noticeable to others or apparent on formal neuropsychologic testing
- ***Mild cognitive impairment*** memory loss becomes noticeable to the patient and family and friends and is confirmed on standardized memory tests
- 50% of MCI progress to AD in 4 years
- replaced by the notion of “early symptomatic AD” to signify that AD is considered the underlying disease (based on clinical or biomarker evidence) in a patient who remains functionally compensated.
- preclinical AD” refers to a person with CSF or positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker evidence of amyloid pathology (with or without tau pathology) in the absence of symptoms.
- Preclinical may precede symptoms by 20 years 
- partial and sometimes generalized seizures herald AD and can occur even prior to dementia onset, especially in younger patients
- cognitive problems begin to interfere with daily activities, such as keeping track of finances, following instructions on the job, driving, shopping, and housekeeping. 
- Some patients are unaware of these difficulties (***anosognosia***), but most remain acutely attuned to their deficits in early disease stages
- Changes in environment (travel, relocation, hospitalization) tend to destabilize
- Middle stages 
    - unable to work, is easily lost and confused, and requires daily supervision
    - Language becomes impaired—***first naming, then comprehension, and finally fluency***
    - Apraxia emerges, manifesting as trouble performing learned sequential motor tasks such as using utensils or appliances.
    - Visuospatial deficits begin to interfere with dressing, eating, or even walking
- Late
    - some persons remain ambulatory, wandering aimlessly
    - Loss of judgment and reasoning
    - Delusions are prevalent and usually simple, with common themes of theft, infidelity, or misidentification
    - Disinhibition and uncharacteristic belligerence alternate with passivity and withdrawal
    - Sleep-wake patterns are disrupted, and nighttime wandering
    - shuffling gait with generalized muscle rigidity associated with slowness and awkwardness of movement
    - often look parkinsonian but rarely have a high-amplitude, low-frequency tremor at rest
- End 
    - rigid, mute, incontinent, and bedridden
    - need help with eating, dressing, and toileting
    - Hyperactive tendon reflexes and myoclonic jerks (sudden brief contractions of various muscles or the whole body) may occur spontaneously or in response to physical or auditory stimulation.
    - death results from malnutrition, secondary infections, pulmonary emboli, heart disease, or, ***most commonly, aspiration*** 
- typical duration of symptomatic AD is 8–10 years, but the course ranges from 1–25 years
# Diagnosis 
- Early in the disease course, other etiologies of dementia should be excluded 
- [[Dementia#causes of dementia]]
- Neuroimaging studies (CT and MRI) do not show a single specific pattern with AD and may be normal early in the disease.
- with progress usually ***posterior-predominant cortical atrophy*** becomes apparent, along with ***atrophy of the medial temporal memory structures***
- CT/MRI mainly to exclude secondary causes 
- Functional imaging studies, such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, reveal hypometabolism in the posterior temporal-parietal cortex in AD
- Amyloid PET imaging 
	- radiotracers (11C)PIB, (18F)florbetapir, (18F)florbetaben, or (18F)flutemetamol 
	- confirms the presence of neuritic and diffuse Aβ plaques throughout the neocortex
	- approximately 25% of cognitively unimpaired older individuals also have positive scans
	- ligands also bind to vascular Aβ deposits in ***cerebral amyloid angiopathy***
- Tau radiotracers 
	- (18F)flortuacipir, (18F)MK-6240
	- bind to the paired helical filaments that form NFTs 
	- binding is largely consistent with Braak neuropathologic staging of NFTs 
	- early retention in medial temporal regions, followed by spread into temporoparietal and cingu- late cortices, dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and, ultimately, primary sensory and motor areas 
- CSF 
	- generally normal 
	- reductions in Aβ42 levels and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio correlate with amyloid deposition 
	- increases in phosphorylated tau (at residue 181 or 217) correlate with tangle inclusions,
	- increases in total tau levels represent a nonspecific finding seen in AD but also in other causes of neurodegeneration
- EEG normal or nonspecific slowing 
- ***Slowly progressive decline in memory and orientation, normal results on laboratory tests, and an MRI or CT scan showing only distributed or posteriorly predominant cortical and hippocampal atrophy are highly suggestive of AD.*** 
- misdiagnoses due to limbic-predominant age- related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) neuropathologic changes with or without hippocampal sclerosis, primary age-related tauopa- thy, DLB, vascular pathology, or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD) 
# Epidemiology 
- positive family history of dementia suggests a genetic contribution to AD, which is usually attributable to the ApoE ε4 risk allele 
- Female sex is a risk factor independent 
- history of mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury increases the risk 
- environmental factors, including aluminum, mercury, and viruses, have been proposed as causes of AD 
- studies suggest that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents is associated with a decreased risk of AD 
- do from book 
# Pathology 
- earliest and most severe degeneration is usually found in the 
	- medial temporal lobe (entorhinal/perirhinal cortex and hippocampus),
	- inferolateral temporal cortex, and 
	- nucleus basalis of Meynert
- microscopic findings are neuritic plaques and NFTs 
- graded based on the topography of Aβ plaques, the density of neuritic plaques, and the spatial extent of NFTs present 
- soluble amyloid species called ***oligomers*** may cause cellular dysfunction and represent the early toxic molecule in AD
- neuritic plaques--> 
	- central core of amyloid, proteoglycans, ApoE, α- antichymotrypsin, and other proteins 
	- core is surrounded by a halo, which contains dystrophic, tau-immunoreactive neurites and activated microglia
- Aβ is a protein of 39–42 amino acids that is derived proteolytically from a larger transmembrane protein, ***amyloid precursor protein (APP),***
- accumulation of Aβ in cerebral arterioles is termed ***amyloid angiopathy***
- NFTs are 
	- composed of silver-staining neuronal cytoplasmic fibrils composed of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein; 
	- appear as paired helical filaments by electron microscopy 
- associated with a decrease in the cortical levels of several proteins and neurotransmitters, especially acetylcholine 
- Reduction of acetylcholine reflects degeneration of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, located just below the thalamus and adjacent to the third ventricle, that project throughout the cortex. 
- noradrenergic and serotonergic depletion due to degeneration of upper brainstem nuclei such as the locus coeruleus (norepinephrine) and dorsal raphe (serotonin)
# genetic
- APP gene on chromosome 21.
    - Adults with trisomy 21 (Down’s syndrome) develop neuropathologic hallmarks of AD if they survive beyond age 40 years, 
    - and many develop a progressive dementia superimposed on their baseline deficits
    - early-age-of-onset familial AD (FAD) have point mutations in APP (first examples of single-gene autosomal dominant transmission of AD)
- Presenilin-1 (PSEN-1)
    - chromosome 14 
    - encodes presenilin-1 protein (also known as S182).
    - Mutations cause early-age-of-onset AD, 
    - onset before age 60 and often before age 50, 
    - transmitted in an autosomal dominant, highly penetrant fashion
- Presenilin-2 (PSEN-2)
    - chromosome 1
    - encodes the presenilin-2 protein (also known as STM2)
    - PSEN-1 are much more common than those in PSEN-2
- presenilins are highly homologous and encode similar proteins that at first appeared to have seven transmembrane domains (hence the designation STM), but subsequent studies have suggested eight such domains, with a ninth submembrane region
- homologous to a cell-trafficking protein, sel 12, found in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
- mutations in the presenilin genes have elevated CSF levels of Aβ42 even before symptoms 
- PSEN-1 are the most c mon cause of early-age-of-onset FAD (40–70% of all cases)
- PSEN-1 tend to produce AD with an earlier age of onset (mean onset 45 years) and a shorter, more rapidly progressive course (mean duration 6–7 years) than mutations in PSEN-2 (mean onset 53 years; duration 11 years)
- APOE gene
    - chromosome 19
    - The protein product, ApoE, participates in cholesterol transport 
    - gene has three alleles: ε2, ε3, and ε4
    - ApoE ε4 allele confers increased risk of AD in the general population, including sporadic and late-age-of-onset familial forms
    - increased risk single ε4 allele is especially prominent in women
    - ApoE ε4 allele represents the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic AD
    - acts as a dose-dependent disease modifier, with each ApoE ε4 allele associated with an approximately 10-year earlier age of onset 
    - increased risk for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), DLB, and vascular dementia, while its association with FTD is uncertain
- Other genes
    - clusterin (CLU),
    - phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) 
    - complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1 (CR1) genes
# Treatment 
## PATIENT AND CAREGIVER EDUCATION
- memory aids such as notebooks and posted daily reminders in early stages
- emphasize activities that are pleasant while curtailing those that increase stress on the patient
- Use of adult day-care centers can be helpful 
- Loss of independence and change of environment may worsen confusion, agitation, and anger.
## NEUROTRANSMITTER-BASED THERAPIES
- Approved
	- inhibition of the cholinesterases, primarily acetylcholinesterase,
		- Donepezil (target dose, 10 mg daily), 
		- rivastigmine (target dose, 6 mg twice daily or 9.5-mg patch daily), 
		- galantamine (target dose 24 mg daily, extended-release),
	- memantine (target dose, 10 mg twice daily) — blocking overexcited N-methyl-d-aspartate(NMDA) glutamate receptors
- Dose escalations over 4–6 weeks to minimize side effects
- anticholinesterase inhibitor maintains his or her mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score for close to a year
- mementine not approved for mild AD
- None effective in MCI
- Cholinesterase inhibitors are relatively easy to administer, and their major side effects are gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, cramps), altered sleep with unpleasant or vivid dreams, bradycardia (usually benign), and muscle cramps.
- effects associated with memantine include constipation, dizziness, headache, and somnolence
- initiate a cholinesterase inhibitor for a patient diagnosed with mild AD dementia, and to add memantine when patients enter the moderate stage of disease
## THERAPIES TARGETING AMYLOID-a
- ***aducanumab***, a monoclonal antibody targeting the N-terminus of the Aβ peptide, reduction in Aβ plaques
- aducanumab should only be considered for treatment of patients with MCI or early dementia due to AD
- biomarker confirmation of Aβ based on CSF or PET be required prior to initiating treatment, since clinical diagnosis in isolation is not sufficient to ensure the presence of Aβ plaques.
- neurological or psychiatric conditions, unstable medical illnesses, evidence of prior brain hemorrhages (including multiple microhemorrhages), or active anticoagulant treatment should be excluded
- administered as an intravenous infusion every 4 weeks 
- gradual dose titration from 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg over seven infusions 
- Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are the most common adverse effect
- ARIA can manifest as vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) or cortical microhemorrhages and superficial siderosis (ARIA-H)
- symptoms associated with ARIA were headache, altered mental status, dizziness, visual disturbances, and nausea.
- Baseline and safety surveillance MRI scans (at minimum following the 7th and 12th infusions) are required
- patients with contraindications to MRI cannot safely receive this therapy 
- ARIA-E is more common in ApoE ε4 carriers
## ADDITIONAL THERAPIES
- Mild-to-moderate depression is common in the early stages of AD and may respond to antidepressants or cholinesterase inhibitors.
- SSRIs are commonly used due to their low anticholinergic side effects (for example, escitalopram, target dose 5–10 mg daily)
- Seizures can be treated with levetiracetam
- newer generation of atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine, are being used in low doses to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms like Agitation, insomnia, hallucinations, and belligerence
- antipsychotics carry a black box FDA warning for use in elderly patients with dementia and thus should be prescribed only with caution
- Medications with strong anticholinergic effects should be vigilantly avoided, including prescription and over-the-counter sleep aids (e.g., diphenhydramine) or incontinence therapies (e.g., oxybutynin)
## EXPERIMENTAL THERAPIES
- additional anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (e.g., lecanemab, gantenerumab, and donanemab) have shown evidence of robust amyloid plaque lowering on PET 
- Active vaccination against Aβ is another approach that aims to promote immune-mediated clearance of amyloid pathology.
- Monoclonal antibodies directed against phosphorylated tau are in earlier stages of development
- therapeutic approaches targeting tau include: active immunization; inhibition of tau phosphorylation, acetylation, and aggregation; microtubule stabilization; and lowering of tau expression via antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNA.

# Other causes
## Prion disease 
- CJD is a rapidly progressive disorder associated with dementia, focal cortical signs, rigidity, and myoclonus, causing death <1 year after first symptoms appear 
- AD can on occasion present as a rapidly progressive dementia
- corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and DLB are more likely to be mistaken for CJD 
- differential diagnosis 
    - viral or bacterial encephalitides, 
    - Hashimoto’s encephalopathy, 
    - central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, 
    - lymphoma, or 
    - paraneoplastic/autoimmune syndromes
- markedly abnormal periodic complexes on EEG
- cortical ribboning and basal ganglia hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI are diagnostic
## Huntington disease 
- autosomal dominant degenerative brain disorder.
- chorea, behavioral disturbance, and executive impairment 
- begin in the fourth or fifth decade of life, but there is a wide range, from childhood to >70 years 
- Memory not impaired until late in the disease, but attention, judgment, self-awareness, and executive functions deficient at an early stage
- Depression, apathy, social withdrawal, irritability, and intermittent disinhibition are common 
- Delusions and obsessive-compulsive behavior
- course 15 years 
## Normal pressure hydrocephalus 
- uncommon but treatable syndrome
- triad includes an 
	- abnormal gait (ataxic or apractic), 
	- dementia (usually mild to moderate, with an emphasis on executive impairment)
	- urinary urgency or incontinence
- enlarged lateral ventricles (hydrocephalus) with little or no cortical atrophy, although the Sylvian fissures may appear propped open (so-called boxcarring), which can be mistaken for perisylvian atrophy 
- Crowding of dorsal frontal-parietal gyri in NPH vs dorsal atrophy and sulcal widening in PSP and CBD 
- communicating hydrocephalus with a patent aqueduct of Sylvius
- CSF 
	- opening pressure falls in the high-normal range
	- protein, glucose, and cell counts are normal
- Special investigation 
	- radionuclide cisternography (showing a delay in CSF absorption over the convexity 
	- constant-pressure infusion test. 
- transient improvement in gait or cognition may follow lumbar puncture (or serial punctures) with removal of 30–50 mL of CSF but inconsistent 
- Hippocampal atrophy on MRI favors AD, whereas a characteristic “magnetic” gait with external hip rotation, low foot clearance, and short strides, along with prominent truncal sway or instability, favors NPH 
- treatment is shunting in some patients 
## Intracranial hypotension or sagging brain syndrome
- low CSF pressure, 
- leading to downward pressure on the subcortical structures and disruption of cerebral function
- headache, often exacerbated by coughing or a Valsalva maneuver or by moving from lying to standing 
- dizziness, vomiting, disruption of sleep-wake cycles, and sometimes a progressive behavioral variant FTD-like syndrome 
- also maybe caused by CSF leaks secondary to lumbar puncture, head trauma, or spinal cord arachnoid cysts. 
- Treatment consists of finding and patching the CSF leak
## Chronic alcoholism 
- associated malnutrition, especially of B vitamins, particularly thiamine 
- also produce cerebral damage 
- ***Marchiafava-Bignami disease***
	- A rare idiopathic syndrome of dementia and seizures with degeneration of the corpus callosum has been reported primarily in male Italian red wine drinkers 
## Thiamine Deficiency 
- Wernicke’s encephalopathy
- usually a malnourished patient (frequently but not necessarily alcoholic) 
- with ***confusion, ataxia, and diplopia*** 
- resulting from inflammation and necrosis of periventricular midline structures, including dorsomedial thalamus, mammillary bodies, midline cerebellum, periaqueductal gray matter, and trochlear and abducens nuclei
- dorsomedial thalamus lesions correlates most closely with the memory loss
- parenteral thiamine (100 mg intravenously for 3 days followed by daily oral dosage) may reverse the disease 
- Korsakoff's syndrome 
	- irreversible and profound amnestic syndrome 
	- unable to recall ***new information*** despite normal immediate memory, attention span, and level of consciousness 
	- knowledge acquired prior to the illness remains relatively intact 
	- Confabulation is common 
	- Mammillary body atrophy may be visible on MRI
## B12 deficiency 
- pernicious anemia, causes a megaloblastic anemia and may also damage the nervous system 
- spinal cord syndrome (myelopathy) affecting the posterior columns (loss of vibration and position sense) and corticospinal tracts (hyperactive tendon reflexes with Babinski signs) 
- damages peripheral nerves (neuropathy), resulting in sensory loss with depressed tendon reflexes. 
- Damage to myelinated axons may also cause dementia 
- mechanism 
	- deficiency of S-adenosyl methionine (required for methylation of myelin phospholipids) due to reduced methionine synthase activity or accumulation of methylmalonate, homocysteine, and propionate, providing abnormal substrates for fatty acid synthesis in myelin. 
- Neurological manifestations may occur in absence of anemia so dont use CBC only
- Treatment with parenteral vitamin B12 (1000 μg intramuscularly daily for a week, weekly for a month, and monthly for life for pernicious anemia) stops progression of the disease 
## Pellagra 
- Deficiency of nicotinic acid 
- skin rash over sun-exposed areas, glossitis, and angular stomatitis 
- Severe dietary deficiency of nicotinic acid along with other B vitamins such as pyridoxine may result in spastic paraparesis, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, irritability, and dementia
- Low serum folate levels appear to be a rough index of malnutrition, but isolated folate deficiency has not been proved as a specific cause of dementia. 
## CNS infections 
- delirium and other acute neurologic syndromes 
- chronic CNS infections like meningitis may cause dementia 
- suspected in patients presenting with a dementia or behavioral syndrome, who also have headache, meningismus, cranial neuropathy, and/or radiculopathy 
- psychomotor retardation, apathy, and impaired memory 
## Neoplasm 
- Primary and metastatic neoplasms of the CNS 
- FND, seizure more common than dementia 
- if tumour in frontal or temporal lobes, the initial manifestations may be memory loss or behavioral changes 
- Limbic encephalitis 
	- autoimmune, sometimes paraneoplastic, syndrome of dementia associated with occult carcinoma (often small-cell lung cancer) 
	- confusion, agitation, seizures, poor memory, emotional changes, and frank dementia 
- Paraneoplastic encephalitis associated with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies presents as a progressive psychiatric disorder with memory loss and seizures; affected patients are often young women with ovarian teratoma.
- Autoimmune 
	- leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1; faciobrachial dystonic seizures)
	- contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2; insomnia, ataxia, myotonia)
	- α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4- propionic acid (AMPA)-receptor (limbic encephalitis with relapses)
## Nonconvulsive Seizure 
- confusion, clouding of consciousness, and garbled speech 
- EEG demonstrates the epileptic nature of the illness 
- recurrent or persistent, the condition may be termed complex partial status epilepticus 
- responds to anticonvulsant therapy 
- caused by previous small strokes or head trauma; some cases are idiopathic 
## Isolated vasculitis of the CNS (CNS granulomatous angiitis) 
- chronic encephalopathy associated with confusion, disorientation, and clouding of consciousness. 
- Headache is common 
- strokes and cranial neuropathies may occur
- CSF analysis reveals a mild pleocytosis or protein elevation 
- angiography can show multifocal stenoses involving medium- caliber vessels, but some patients have only small-vessel disease that is not revealed on angiography 
- Some patients respond to glucocorticoids or chemotherapy. 
- poor prognosis 
## Chronic metal exposure 
- rare 
- elicit a history of exposure at work or home 
- Chronic lead poisoning
	- from inadequately fire-glazed pottery 
	- Fatigue, depression, and confusion 
	- episodic abdominal pain and peripheral neuropathy 
	- Gray lead lines in the gums,
	- anemia with basophilic stippling of red blood cells 
	- acute intermittent porphyria is differential 
	- elevated levels of urine porphyrins as a result of the inhibition of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydrase 
	- treat with chelation with EDTA 
- Chronic mercury poisoning 
	- dementia, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and tremulousness that may progress to a cerebellar intention tremor or choreoathetosis 
	- transverse white lines of the fingernails (Mees’ lines) 
	- chelation therapy with dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite, BAL) 
- Aluminum poisoning
- rare, dialysis dementia syndrome
- water used during renal dialysis was contaminated with aluminum.
- progressive encephalopathy associated with confusion, nonfluent aphasia, memory loss, agitation, and, later, lethargy and stupor

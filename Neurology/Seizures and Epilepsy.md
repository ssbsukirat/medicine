- Focal seizures originate within networks limited to one brain region 
	- note that the term partial seizures is no longer used 
	- associated with structure abnormalities 
- Generalized seizures arise within and rapidly engage networks distributed across both cerebral hemispheres 
	- may have cellular , biochemical or structural 
# Focal onset seizure 
- arise from a neuronal network either discretely localized within one brain region or more broadly distributed but still within a cerebral hemisphere 
- no more simple or complex

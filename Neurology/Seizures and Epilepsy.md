- Seizure 
	- ***transient occurrence of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain***
	- 5-10% have an episode once mostly in early childhood or late adult 
- Epilepsy is ***condition in which a person has a risk of recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process***

- Focal seizures originate within networks limited to one brain region 
	- note that the term partial seizures is no longer used 
	- associated with structure abnormalities 
- Generalized seizures arise within and rapidly engage networks distributed across both cerebral hemispheres 
	- may have cellular , biochemical or structural 
# Focal onset seizure 
- arise from a neuronal network either discretely localized within one brain region or more broadly distributed but still within a cerebral hemisphere 
- no more simple or complex 
- effect on ***awareness (intact or impaired)*** and nature of the ***onset (motor or nonmotor)***
- can also evolve into generalized seizures 
	- earlier focal seizure with secondary generalisation 
	- but now description of type of generalised seizure evolving from focal seizure

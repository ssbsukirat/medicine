	- hormonal fluctuations during menses; 
	- lack of or excess sleep;

## Pathogenesis
- dysfunction of monoaminergic sensory control systems located in the brainstem and hypothalamus
- Activation at trigeminal nucleus results in the release of vasoactive neuropeptides, particularly calcitonin geneâ€“related peptide (CGRP)
- second-order trigeminal neurons cross the midline and project to ventrobasal and posterior nuclei of the thalamus 
- projections to the periaqueductal gray and hypo- thalamus, from which reciprocal descending systems have established antinociceptive effects 
- 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; also known as serotonin) also involved 
- triptans are potent agonists of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors and some at ***5-HT1F (ditans)***

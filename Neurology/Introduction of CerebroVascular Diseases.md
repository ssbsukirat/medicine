# Cerebrovascular Diseases: Introduction and Definition

## Overview and Epidemiology

- Cerebrovascular diseases include ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.
- Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide.
    - 6.2 million people died from stroke in 2015.
    - The lifetime global risk of stroke from age 25 years onward was 25% in 2016.
- Nearly 7 million Americans aged 20 or older report having had a stroke.
- The overall disease burden is expected to climb as the population ages.
- Stroke is likely to remain the second most common disabling condition in individuals aged 50 or older worldwide.

## Definitions

- A stroke (cerebrovascular accident) is clinically defined as an **abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit** attributable to a focal vascular cause.
- Brain imaging and laboratory studies are used to support the diagnosis.
- Cerebral ischemia is caused by a **reduction in blood flow** lasting longer than several seconds.
    - Neurologic symptoms manifest within seconds because neurons lack glycogen.
- **Infarction (death of brain tissue)** results if flow cessation lasts for more than a few minutes.
- **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):** Occurs when blood flow is quickly restored, brain tissue recovers fully, and symptoms are transient.
    - Requires all neurologic signs and symptoms to resolve within 24 hours without evidence of brain infarction on imaging.
- **Stroke:** Has occurred if neurologic signs and symptoms last for >24 hours or if brain infarction is demonstrated.

## Causes of Symptoms

- **Focal Ischemia or Infarction:** Usually caused by thrombosis of cerebral vessels or by emboli from a proximal arterial source or the heart.
- **Generalized Reduction in Cerebral Blood Flow:** Due to systemic hypotension (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic shock) usually produces syncope.
    - If low flow persists, infarction may develop in border zones between major cerebral artery distributions.
    - Global hypoxia-ischemia causes widespread brain injury, called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
- **Intracranial Hemorrhage:** Caused by bleeding directly into or around the brain.
    - Produces symptoms via mass effect, toxic effects of blood, or increased intracranial pressure.
    - Important causes include aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

# Approach to the Patient

## Rapid Evaluation

- Rapid evaluation is essential for the use of acute treatments such as thrombolysis or thrombectomy.
- Patients often do not seek medical help themselves (due to anosognosia or lack of knowledge); family or bystanders often call for assistance.

## Recognition of Acute Stroke Symptoms

- Patients and family should call emergency medical services immediately if they witness the sudden onset of:
    - Loss of sensory and/or motor function on one side of the body (hemiparesis occurs in nearly 85% of ischemic stroke patients).
    - Change in vision, gait, or ability to speak or understand.
    - A sudden, severe headache.
- **FAST** (Facial weakness, Arm weakness, Speech abnormality, and Time) is an acronym used to teach the public about common symptoms and underscore that treatments are highly time sensitive.

## Conditions Mimicking Stroke

- Causes of sudden-onset neurologic symptoms that may mimic stroke include:
    - **Seizure:** Usually excluded by history showing no convulsive activity at onset, though ongoing complex partial seizures can mimic stroke.
    - **Intracranial tumor:** May present acutely due to hemorrhage, seizure, or hydrocephalus.
    - **Migraine:** Can mimic stroke, even acephalgic migraine (without head pain).
        - Migraine deficits (sensory or motor) tend to migrate slowly across a limb over minutes, not seconds.
        - Diagnosis is more secure if the disturbance crosses vascular boundaries or if classic visual symptoms (e.g., scintillating scotomata) are present.
    - **Metabolic encephalopathy:** Typically produces fluctuating mental status changes without focal neurologic findings.
        - Can "unmask" a prior deficit (e.g., recurrent hemiparesis) in the setting of fever or sepsis.

## Initial Imaging and Management

- Once stroke is diagnosed, brain imaging is required to determine if the cause is ischemia or hemorrhage.
- **Computed tomography (CT) imaging** is the standard modality to detect the presence or absence of intracranial hemorrhage.
- If the stroke is ischemic, acute treatments like recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) or endovascular mechanical thrombectomy may be used to restore cerebral perfusion.
- Medical management to reduce complications and planning for secondary prevention follow acute treatment.
    - Secondary prevention strategies vary based on the cause of ischemic stroke (e.g., cardiac embolus, carotid atherosclerosis).

# Stroke Syndromes: Localization

## General Approach

- A careful history and neurologic examination can often localize the region of brain dysfunction.
- If localization corresponds to an arterial distribution, potential causes can be narrowed.
- Stroke syndromes are classified into:
    1. Large-vessel stroke within the anterior circulation.
    2. Large-vessel stroke within the posterior circulation.
    3. Small-vessel disease of either vascular bed.

## Anterior Circulation Syndromes

### Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA)

- The anterior circulation is composed of the internal carotid artery and its branches.
- Occlusion of the proximal MCA or major branches is most often due to an **embolus** (artery-to-artery, cardiac, or unknown).
- **Vascular Supply:**
    - Cortical branches supply the lateral surface of the hemisphere (except the frontal pole, superomedial strip, and lower temporal/occipital pole).
    - The proximal MCA (M1 segment) gives rise to **lenticulostriate arteries** which supply deep structures including the putamen, internal capsule (posterior limb), adjacent corona radiata, and most of the caudate nucleus.
    - MCA often divides into superior (supplies frontal and superior parietal cortex) and inferior (supplies inferior parietal and temporal cortex) divisions (M2 branches).

|Syndrome/Lobe Affected|Signs and Symptoms|Structures/Area Involved|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Complete MCA Occlusion**|Contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, homonymous hemianopia, temporary gaze preference to ipsilateral side, dysarthria.|Proximal MCA (M1) blocking penetrating and cortical branches.|
|**Dominant Hemisphere**|Global aphasia; Motor aphasia; Central aphasia, word deafness, Gerstmann syndrome (acalculia, alexia, finger agnosia, right-left confusion); Conduction aphasia.|Somatic motor/sensory area for face/arm/leg, speech areas.|
|**Nondominant Hemisphere**|Anosognosia, constructional apraxia, neglect; Apractagnosia, hemiasomatognosia, agnosia for left half of external space, dressing/constructional "apraxia," impaired distance judgment, visual illusions.|Nondominant parietal lobe.|
|**Inferior Division, Dominant**|Fluent (Wernicke’s) aphasia without weakness, jargon speech, inability to comprehend written/spoken language, often contralateral, homonymous superior quadrantanopia.|Posterior part (temporal cortex) of the dominant hemisphere.|
|**Inferior Division, Nondominant**|Hemineglect or spatial agnosia without weakness.|Inferior division of the MCA in the nondominant hemisphere.|

- **Small-vessel (Lacunar) Stroke:** Occlusion of a lenticulostriate vessel.
    - Location: Internal capsule.
    - Manifests as: Pure motor stroke or sensory-motor stroke contralateral to the lesion.
    - If genu of internal capsule is ischemic: Primarily facial weakness, followed by arm, then leg weakness.
    - _Clumsy hand, dysarthria lacunar syndrome:_ Contralateral hand may become ataxic and dysarthria is prominent.

### Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA)

- **Anatomy:** Divided into precommunal (A1, connects ICA to anterior communicating artery) and postcommunal (A2, distal to anterior communicating artery) segments.
    - A1 segment gives rise to deep penetrating branches supplying the anterior limb of the internal capsule, anterior perforate substance, amygdala, anterior hypothalamus, and inferior caudate nucleus head.
- **Proximal Occlusion (A1):** Usually well tolerated due to collateral flow through the anterior communicating artery and MCA/PCA collaterals.
- **Single A2 Segment Occlusion (Contralateral Symptoms):**
    - Paralysis of opposite foot and leg (Motor leg area).
    - Lesser degree of paresis of opposite arm.
    - Cortical sensory loss over toes, foot, and leg.
    - Urinary incontinence.
    - Contralateral grasp reflex, sucking reflex, gegenhalten (paratonic rigidity).
    - Abulia (akinetic mutism), slowness, lack of spontaneity.
    - Impairment of gait and stance (gait apraxia).
- **Bilateral A2 Occlusion:** Occurs if both A2 segments arise from a single stem.
    - Results in profound abulia, bilateral pyramidal signs with paraparesis or quadriparesis, and urinary incontinence.
    - May also cause dyspraxia of left limbs and tactile aphasia in left limbs (Corpus callosum involvement).

### Anterior Choroidal Artery

- Arises from the internal carotid artery.
- **Supply:** Posterior limb of the internal capsule, and white matter posterolateral to it (containing some geniculocalcarine fibers).
- **Complete Syndrome:** Contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia (hypesthesia), and homonymous hemianopia.
    - _Note:_ Minimal deficits often occur due to collateral supply from MCA and posterior choroidal arteries.
- Cause: Usually _in situ_ thrombosis; vulnerable to iatrogenic occlusion during surgery near ICA aneurysms.

### Internal Carotid Artery (ICA)

- **Symptoms:** Vary depending on whether ischemia is caused by propagated thrombus, embolism, or low flow.
    - MCA territory cortex is affected most often.
    - Occlusion may go unnoticed with a competent Circle of Willis.
    - If thrombus propagates or embolizes the MCA, symptoms are identical to proximal MCA occlusion.
- **Occlusion of both ACA and MCA origins (at carotid top):** Abulia or stupor with hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and aphasia or anosognosia.
- **Amaurosis Fugax (Transient Monocular Blindness):** Recurrent warning sign in ~25% of symptomatic ICA disease.
    - Patients describe a horizontal shade sweeping across the field of vision.
    - Symptoms typically last only a few minutes.
    - ICA perfuses the optic nerve and retina via the ophthalmic artery.

### Common Carotid Artery (CCA)

- Occlusion may present with all symptoms and signs of internal carotid occlusion.
- Low flow in the external carotid branches may cause **jaw claudication**.
- Bilateral CCA occlusions may occur in Takayasu’s arteritis.

## Posterior Circulation Syndromes

- Composed of paired vertebral arteries, basilar artery, and paired PCAs.
- Supply: Cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, subthalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, and medial temporal/occipital lobes.

### Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA)

- **Origin:** Most often arises from basilar bifurcation (75%); 20% arise from the ipsilateral ICA (fetal PCA).
- Syndromes usually result from atheroma formation or emboli lodging at the top of the basilar artery.
- PCA syndromes are divided into:
    1. **P1 Syndrome:** Midbrain, subthalamic, and thalamic signs (due to proximal P1 segment or penetrating branches).
    2. **P2 Syndrome:** Cortical temporal and occipital lobe signs (due to occlusion of the P2 segment).

#### P1 Syndromes (Central Territory)

- Infarction location: Ipsilateral subthalamus, medial thalamus, cerebral peduncle, and midbrain.
- **Claude’s syndrome:** Third nerve palsy with contralateral ataxia (involvement of dentatorubrothalamic tract).
- **Weber’s syndrome:** Third nerve palsy and contralateral hemiplegia (hemiplegia localized to cerebral peduncle).
- Involvement of the subthalamic nucleus may cause contralateral hemiballismus.
- Occlusion of the artery of Percheron: Paresis of upward gaze and drowsiness, often abulia.
- **Bilateral Proximal PCA Occlusion:** Coma, unreactive pupils, bilateral pyramidal signs, and decerebrate rigidity.
- **Thalamic Déjérine-Roussy syndrome:** Contralateral hemisensory loss followed by agonizing, searing, or burning pain in affected areas.

#### P2 Syndromes (Peripheral Territory)

- Infarction location: Medial temporal and occipital lobes.
- **Contralateral homonymous hemianopia without macula sparing** is usual (calcarine cortex involved).
- Medial temporal lobe/hippocampal involvement: Acute memory defect (especially if dominant hemisphere is involved).
- If dominant hemisphere infarct extends to the splenium of the corpus callosum: **Alexia without agraphia**.
- Other findings: Visual agnosia, anomia with paraphasic errors (amnestic aphasia), and peduncular hallucinosis (visual hallucinations).
- **Bilateral Distal PCA Infarction:** **Cortical blindness** (preserved pupillary light reaction).
    - Patient may be unaware of or deny blindness (Anton’s syndrome).
    - Rarely, central vision is spared ("gun-barrel" vision).
- **Bilateral Visual Association Area Lesions (Watershed):** May result in Balint’s syndrome (disorder of visual scanning), palinopsia, or asimultanagnosia.

### Vertebral Artery and Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)

- **Vertebral Artery Disease:** Atherothrombotic lesions favor V1 and V4 segments.
    - V1 disease can produce posterior circulation emboli.
    - Stenosis proximal to PICA origin can threaten the lateral medulla and posterior inferior cerebellum.
- **Subclavian Steal:** Occlusion of the subclavian artery proximal to vertebral origin causes reversal of flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery, potentially leading to posterior circulation TIAs during arm exercise.

#### Lateral Medullary (Wallenberg’s) Syndrome

- Caused by embolic occlusion or thrombosis of a V4 segment or PICA.

|Side of Lesion|Side Opposite Lesion|
|:--|:--|
|Vertigo, numbness of the ipsilateral face, diplopia, hoarseness, dysarthria, dysphagia, ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome, ipsilateral upper motor neuron facial weakness.|Numbness of contralateral limbs.|
|Pain, numbness, impaired sensation over one-half the face (Descending tract/nucleus fifth nerve).|Impaired pain and thermal sense over half the body, sometimes face (Spinothalamic tract).|
|Ataxia of limbs, falling to side of lesion.||
|Nystagmus, vertigo, vomiting (Vestibular nucleus).||

- **Medial Medullary Syndrome:** Rarely occurs with infarction of the pyramid.
    - On side of lesion: Paralysis with atrophy of one-half the tongue (Ipsilateral twelfth nerve).
    - On side opposite lesion: Contralateral hemiparesis of arm and leg (sparing face); impaired tactile and proprioceptive sense.
- **Cerebellar Infarction Complication:** Cerebellar swelling can cause brainstem herniation, hydrocephalus, and central herniation, potentially leading to respiratory arrest.

### Basilar Artery

- **Branches:** Paramedia (pons midline), short circumferential (lateral pons), and bilateral long circumferential (SCA and AICA).
- **Disease Location:** Atheromatous lesions are most frequent in proximal basilar and distal vertebral segments.

#### Basilar Artery Syndromes

- **Complete Basilar Occlusion:** Easily recognized by a constellation of **bilateral long tract signs** (sensory and motor) combined with cranial nerve and cerebellar dysfunction.
    - Patients may have spontaneous myoclonic posturing movements simulating seizures.
    - Can result in a **"locked-in" state** (preserved consciousness with quadriplegia and cranial nerve signs).
    - Carries a high mortality.
- **Impending Occlusion/TIAs:** A series of TIAs and a slowly progressive, fluctuating stroke often herald atherothrombotic occlusion.
    - Proximal basilar TIAs may produce vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, facial/circumoral numbness, and hemisensory symptoms.
    - Basilar artery TIAs usually affect both sides; basilar branch TIAs affect one side.
- **Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA) Occlusion:**
    - On side of lesion: Severe ipsilateral cerebellar ataxia, nausea, vomiting, dysarthria; Miosis, ptosis, decreased sweating (Horner’s syndrome).
    - On side opposite lesion: Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation over extremities, body, and face; Impaired touch, vibration, and position sense (Medial lemniscus).
- **Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA) Occlusion:**
    - On side of lesion: Ipsilateral deafness, facial weakness, vertigo, nausea and vomiting, nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia, Horner’s syndrome, and paresis of conjugate lateral gaze.
    - On side opposite lesion: Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation.

# Imaging Studies

## CT Scans

- **Role:** Identify or exclude hemorrhage, and detect neoplasms, abscesses, or other conditions mimicking stroke.
- **Acute Findings:** Generally show no abnormality in the first few hours of infarction; infarcts may not be reliably seen for 24–48 hours.
- **Limitations:** May miss small ischemic strokes in the posterior fossa (due to bone artifact) or small cortical surface infarcts.
- **Noncontrast CT:** Imaging modality of choice for acute stroke due to speed and availability.
- **CT Angiography (CTA):** Uses IV contrast to visualize cervical and intracranial arteries and veins.
    - Identifies carotid disease and intracranial vascular occlusions.
    - Sensitive for SAH and can identify intracranial aneurysms.
- **CT Perfusion Imaging:** Demonstrates deficits in brain perfusion.
    - Used to predict the region of infarcted brain and the brain at risk (ischemic penumbra).

## Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

- **Role:** Reliably documents the extent and location of infarction in all areas, including the posterior fossa and cortical surface. Also identifies intracranial hemorrhage.
- **Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI):** More sensitive for early brain infarction than standard MR sequences or CT.
- **MR Perfusion Studies:** Provide a measure of the ischemic penumbra, defined as the mismatch between poor perfusion and the DWI abnormality.
- **MR Angiography:** Highly sensitive for stenosis of extracranial ICA and large intracranial vessels, though it may overestimate stenosis.
- **MRI with fat saturation:** Used to visualize clotted blood within the dissected vessel wall (arterial dissection).
- **Iron-sensitive imaging (ISI):** Detects cerebral microbleeds.
- **Limitations:** MRI is more expensive, time consuming, and less readily available than CT; most acute protocols prefer CT.
- **Utility in TIA:** More likely to identify new infarction, a strong predictor of subsequent stroke.

## Cerebral Angiography (Conventional X-Ray)

- **Gold Standard:** For identifying and quantifying atherosclerotic stenoses and characterizing pathologies (aneurysms, vasospasm, thrombi, vasculitis, fibromuscular dysplasia).
- **Risks:** Includes arterial damage, embolic stroke, and renal failure.
- **Use:** Reserved for situations where less invasive means are inadequate.
- Essential for guiding endovascular thrombectomy for ICA terminus or MCA occlusions.

## Ultrasound and Perfusion Techniques

- **Duplex Ultrasound:** Uses B-mode imaging and Doppler flow velocity assessment to identify and quantify stenosis at the origin of the internal carotid artery.
- **Transcranial Doppler (TCD):** Assesses flow in MCA, ACA, PCA, and vertebrobasilar systems.
    - Can detect stenotic lesions in large intracranial arteries (via increased systolic flow velocity) and microemboli.
- **Perfusion Quantification:** Xenon techniques (xenon-CT) and PET quantify cerebral blood flow, typically used for research or determining the significance of stenosis.
- **Relative Perfusion:** SPECT and MR perfusion techniques report relative cerebral blood flow.
- **Integration:** MR angiography combined with ultrasound, or CTA of the entire head and neck, often eliminates the need for conventional x-ray angiography.

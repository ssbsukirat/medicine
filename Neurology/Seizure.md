### SEIZURE OVERVIEW

A seizure is a transient occurrence of signs or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. This abnormal brain activity can manifest in various ways, from dramatic convulsive activity to subtle experiential phenomena.

#### Key Points
- **Incidence**: ∼5–10% of the population will have at least one seizure, with the highest incidence in early childhood and late adulthood.
- **Definition**: 
  - **Seizure**: Transient abnormal brain activity.
  - **Epilepsy**: Condition with a risk of recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process.
  - **Epilepsy Syndrome**: Clinical and pathologic characteristics that suggest a specific underlying etiology.

#### Incidence and Prevalence of Epilepsy
- **Incidence**: ∼0.3–0.5% in different populations worldwide.
- **Prevalence**: 5–30 persons per 1000.

### CLASSIFICATION OF SEIZURES

Determining the type of seizure is essential for diagnosis, therapy selection, and prognosis. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Commission updated their classification in 2017.

#### General Principles
- **Focal Seizures**: Originate within networks limited to one brain region.
- **Generalized Seizures**: Arise and rapidly engage networks across both cerebral hemispheres.
- **Etiology**: 
  - **Focal Seizures**: Often associated with structural brain abnormalities.
  - **Generalized Seizures**: May result from cellular, biochemical, or widespread structural abnormalities.

#### Focal Onset Seizures
- **Awareness**: Classified based on effect on awareness (intact or impaired).
- **Onset**: Motor or nonmotor onset.
- **Evolution**: Can evolve into generalized seizures.

##### Focal Seizures with Intact Awareness
- **Motor Manifestations**: Tonic, clonic, or myoclonic movements.
- **Nonmotor Manifestations**: Sensory, autonomic, or emotional symptoms.
- **EEG**: May show brief discharges termed epileptiform spikes or sharp waves.

**Key Features**:
- **Jacksonian March**: Gradual progression of motor activity.
- **Todd’s Paralysis**: Localized paresis post-seizure.
- **Epilepsia Partialis Continua**: Seizure activity continuing for hours or days.

**Manifestations**:
- **Somatic Sensation**: Paresthesias.
- **Vision**: Flashing lights, hallucinations.
- **Equilibrium**: Sensation of falling, vertigo.
- **Autonomic Function**: Flushing, sweating, piloerection.
- **Temporal/Frontal Lobe Seizures**: Alterations in hearing, olfaction, emotional state.

**Auras**:
- Sensations of fear, impending change, detachment, depersonalization, déjá vu, illusions.

##### Focal Seizures with Impaired Awareness
- **Impairment**: Transient inability to maintain normal contact with the environment.
- **Automatisms**: Involuntary, automatic behaviors (e.g., chewing, lip smacking, hand movements).
- **Post-Seizure**: Confusion, possible anterograde amnesia, or transient neurologic deficits.

#### Evolution of Focal Seizures to Generalized Seizures
- **Spread**: Involve both cerebral hemispheres, often producing a tonic-clonic seizure.
- **Distinction**: Important to differentiate from primary generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures for evaluation and treatment.

### GENERALIZED ONSET SEIZURES

Generalized seizures arise at some point in the brain but immediately and rapidly engage neuronal networks in both cerebral hemispheres. Several types of generalized seizures have features that place them in distinctive categories and facilitate clinical diagnosis.

#### Typical Absence Seizures
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control.
  - Seizure usually lasts for seconds.
  - Consciousness returns suddenly with no postictal confusion.
  - May be accompanied by subtle, bilateral motor signs (e.g., rapid blinking, chewing movements, small-amplitude clonic movements of the hands).
  
- **Demographics**:
  - Associated with genetically determined epilepsies.
  - Onset usually in childhood (ages 4–10) or early adolescence.
  - Main seizure type in 15–20% of children with epilepsy.
  - Seizures can occur hundreds of times per day.

- **Clinical Signs**:
  - Often first clue is unexplained "daydreaming" and a decline in school performance.
  - Often misdiagnosed as an attention deficit disorder.

- **Electrophysiologic Hallmark**:
  - Burst of generalized, symmetric, 3-Hz spike-and-slow-wave discharges on EEG.
  - Hyperventilation tends to provoke these discharges and is used when recording the EEG.

#### Atypical Absence Seizures
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Longer duration of consciousness lapse.
  - Less abrupt onset and cessation.
  - More obvious motor signs, possibly with focal or lateralizing features.
  
- **Electrophysiologic Features**:
  - Generalized, slow spike-and-slow-wave pattern with a frequency of ≤2.5 per second.
  - Often associated with diffuse or multifocal structural brain abnormalities.
  - May accompany other signs of neurologic dysfunction (e.g., mental retardation).
  - Less responsive to anticonvulsants compared to typical absence seizures.

#### Generalized, Tonic-Clonic Seizures
- **Prevalence**:
  - Main seizure type in ~10% of all persons with epilepsy.
  - Common in metabolic derangements and various clinical settings.

- **Phases**:
  - **Prodrome**: Vague premonitory symptoms hours before seizure.
  - **Tonic Phase**:
    - Abrupt onset without warning.
    - Tonic contraction of muscles, producing classic features (e.g., ictal cry, impaired respirations, cyanosis, tongue biting).
    - Enhanced sympathetic tone (increased heart rate, blood pressure, pupillary size).
  - **Clonic Phase**:
    - Superimposition of periods of muscle relaxation on tonic muscle contraction.
    - Lasts no more than 1 min.
  - **Postictal Phase**:
    - Unresponsiveness, muscular flaccidity, excessive salivation, stridorous breathing, partial airway obstruction.
    - Gradual regain of consciousness over minutes to hours.
    - Postictal confusion, headache, fatigue, muscle ache.
  
- **EEG Features**:
  - Tonic phase: Progressive increase in generalized low-voltage fast activity, followed by generalized high-amplitude, polyspike discharges.
  - Clonic phase: High-amplitude activity interrupted by slow waves (spike-and-slow-wave pattern).
  - Postictal EEG: Diffuse suppression of cerebral activity, then gradual recovery.

#### Atonic Seizures
- **Characteristics**:
  - Sudden loss of postural muscle tone lasting 1–2 seconds.
  - Brief impairment of consciousness, usually no postictal confusion.
  - Brief seizure: Quick head drop or nodding movement.
  - Longer seizure: Patient collapses (risk of direct head injury).
  
- **EEG Features**:
  - Brief generalized spike-and-wave discharges followed by diffuse slow waves correlating with loss of muscle tone.
  - Often associated with known epilepsy syndromes.

### Myoclonic Seizures
- **Definition**: Sudden and brief muscle contractions involving one part or the entire body.
- **Normal Example**: Sudden jerking movement observed while falling asleep.
- **Pathologic Myoclonus**: Commonly seen with metabolic disorders, degenerative CNS diseases, or anoxic brain injury.
- **EEG**: Bilaterally synchronous spike-and-slow-wave discharges prior to the movement.
- **Prevalence**: Predominant feature in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME).

### Epileptic Spasms
- **Characteristics**: Briefly sustained flexion or extension of predominantly proximal muscles, including truncal muscles.
- **EEG**: Shows hypsarrhythmia with diffuse, giant slow waves and a chaotic background of irregular, multifocal spikes and sharp waves.
- During the clinical spasm, there is a marked suppression of the EEG background (the “**electrodecremental** response”). 
- **EMG** also reveals a characteristic rhomboid pattern that may help distinguish spasms from brief tonic and myoclonic seizures.
- **Occurrence**: Predominantly in infants due to differences in neuronal function and connectivity.

### Epilepsy Syndromes
- **Definition**: Disorders where epilepsy is the predominant feature, with sufficient clinical, EEG, radiologic, or genetic evidence suggesting a common underlying mechanism.
- ![[seizuresyndromes.png]]

#### Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME)
- **Onset**: Early adolescence.
- **Characteristics**: Bilateral myoclonic jerks, typically occurring in the morning after awakening, often provoked by sleep deprivation.
- **Other Seizures**: Generalized tonic-clonic seizures and absence seizures in up to one-third of patients.
- **Consciousness**: Preserved unless myoclonus is severe.
- **Treatment**: Seizures usually respond well to anticonvulsants.
- **Genetics**: Often a family history of epilepsy; polygenic cause suggested.

#### Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
- **Onset**: Childhood.
- **Triad**:
  1. Multiple seizure types (generalized tonic-clonic, atonic, atypical absence).
  2. EEG showing slow (<3 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges and various other abnormalities.
  3. Impaired cognitive function in most cases.
- **Causes**: CNS disease/dysfunction due to various causes (e.g., mutations, developmental abnormalities, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, trauma, infection).
- **Prognosis**: Often poor due to underlying CNS disease and the severe consequences of poorly controlled epilepsy.

#### Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Syndrome (MTLE)
- **Common Syndrome**: Associated with focal seizures with impairment of consciousness.
- **EEG and Pathology**: Distinctive features; high-resolution MRI often shows hippocampal sclerosis.
- **Treatment**: Often refractory to anticonvulsants but responds well to surgical intervention.

### Causes of Seizures and Epilepsy
- **Mechanism**: Result from a shift in the normal balance of excitation and inhibition within the CNS.
- **Factors**:
  1. **Susceptibility**: Normal brain capable of having a seizure under appropriate circumstances; genetic factors and normal development influence seizure threshold.
  2. **Chronic Disorders**: Conditions like severe head trauma can lead to chronic seizure disorders through long-lasting pathologic changes (epileptogenesis). Other processes associated with epileptogenesis include stroke, infections, and abnormalities of CNS development.
  3. **Episodic Nature**: Seizures occur intermittently; precipitating factors include stress, sleep deprivation, hormonal changes, toxic substances, medications, and photic stimulation.

#### Causes According to Age
- **Neonatal/Early Infancy**: 
	- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, trauma, CNS infection, congenital CNS abnormalities, metabolic disorders.
	- babies of mothers using neurotoxic drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or ethanol drug-withdrawal seizures in the first few days after delivery
	- Hypoglycemia and hypocalcemias secondary complication of perinatal injury
	- Inborn errors of metabolism usually 2-3 days later as feeding starts 
	- Pyridoxine B6 deficiency is important treatable cause
- **Late Infancy/Early Childhood**:
	- Febrile seizures 
		- fever without CNS infections 
		- common during rising temperature phase of a febrile illness (day 1)
		- Patient has family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy
		- 3m-5y age with max at 18-24months 
		- generalized, tonic-clonic seizure usually
		- ***simple febrile seizure*** is a single, isolated event, brief, and symmetric in appearance
		- ***Complex febrile seizures*** are characterized by repeated seizure activity, a duration >15 minutes, or by focal features
		- Recurrences are much more likely when the febrile seizure occurs in the first year of life 
		- risk factors for epilepsy later 
			- complex febrile 
			- pre-existing NeurologicaL deficit
			- family history of non-febrile seizures 
	- infections, 
	- developmental disorders.
- **Adolescence/Early Adulthood**: Head trauma, CNS infections, brain tumors, drug use, alcohol withdrawal.
- **Older Adults**: Cerebrovascular disease, trauma, CNS tumors, degenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's).
- **Metabolic Disturbances**: Electrolyte imbalance, hypo-/hyperglycemia, renal/hepatic failure.

### Mechanisms of Seizure Initiation and Propagation
- **Initiation**: Electrographic “spike” due to intense near-simultaneous firing of local excitatory neurons, resulting in hypersynchronization of excitatory bursts.
- **Propagation**: Recruitment of surrounding neurons via synaptic and nonsynaptic mechanisms, such as increases in extracellular K+, accumulation of Ca2+, and activation of NMDA receptors.

### Mechanisms of Epileptogenesis
- **Definition**: Transformation of a normal neuronal network into one that is chronically hyperexcitable.
- **Process**: Initial CNS injury leads to structural changes, local hyperexcitability, and further structural changes over time until spontaneous seizures occur.

### Genetic Causes of Epilepsy
- **Progress**: Identification of genetic mutations associated with various epilepsy syndromes.
- **Channelopathies**: Many inherited epilepsies are due to mutations affecting ion channel function.
- **Susceptibility Genes**: Ongoing research to identify genes underlying idiopathic epilepsies.

### Mechanisms of Action of Antiseizure Drugs
- **Mechanisms**: Modify ion channel activity or neurotransmitters to block seizure initiation or spread.
- **Examples**: 
  - **Na+ Channel Inhibitors**: Phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine.
  - **Ca2+ Channel Blockers**: Gabapentin, pregabalin.
  - **GABA Modulators**: Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, valproic acid.
  - **Other Mechanisms**: Topiramate (glutamate attenuation), levetiracetam (modulation of synaptic vesicles).
### APPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH SEIZURE

#### Initial Management
- **Priorities**: Attention to vital signs, respiratory and cardiovascular support, and seizure treatment if seizures resume.
- **Emergency Conditions**: Recognize and manage CNS infection, metabolic derangement, or drug toxicity.

#### Evaluation for Non-Acutely Ill Patients
- **First Seizure**:
  1. Establish if the episode was a seizure.
  2. Determine the cause by identifying risk factors and precipitating events.
  3. Decide on the need for antiseizure drug therapy and treatment for underlying illness.

- **Patients with Prior Seizures/Epilepsy**:
  1. Identify underlying cause and precipitating factors.
  2. Assess the adequacy of current therapy.

### HISTORY AND EXAMINATION
- **Determine if Event was a Seizure**: In-depth history focusing on symptoms before, during, and after the episode. Interview witnesses.
- **Identify Risk Factors**: History of febrile seizures, family history, earlier auras, head trauma, stroke, tumor, CNS infection.
- **Precipitating Factors**: Sleep deprivation, systemic diseases, metabolic derangements, acute infection, drugs lowering seizure threshold, alcohol or drug use.
- **Physical Examination**: Search for signs of infection, systemic illness, neurocutaneous disorders, chronic diseases, organomegaly, limb asymmetry, head trauma, and substance use.
- **Neurologic Examination**: Emphasize signs of cerebral hemispheric disease. Assess mental status, visual fields, motor function, and cortical sensory testing.

### LABORATORY STUDIES
- **Routine Blood Studies**: Identify metabolic causes (electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, hepatic/renal function).
- **Toxin Screen**: Blood and urine screening for toxins in appropriate risk groups.
- **Lumbar Puncture**: If meningitis or encephalitis is suspected, and mandatory for HIV-infected patients.

### ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC STUDIES
- **EEG**: Record electrical brain activity via scalp electrodes. Helps diagnose and classify seizure disorders, guide treatment, and assess prognosis.
  - **During Seizure**: Abnormal, repetitive, rhythmic activity with a discrete onset and termination.
  - **Interictal Period**: Epileptiform activity (spikes or sharp waves).
  - **Activation Procedures**: Hyperventilation, photic stimulation, sleep deprivation to provoke abnormalities.
  - **Continuous Monitoring**: Video-EEG telemetry or portable continuous EEG for ≥24 hours to capture clinical events.
  - **MEG**: Measures small magnetic fields from brain activity, localizes seizure foci.

### BRAIN IMAGING
- **Indications**: New-onset seizures to detect underlying structural abnormalities.
- **Preferred Method**: MRI, superior to CT for detecting cerebral lesions.
  - **MRI Findings**: Tumors, vascular malformations, cortical architecture abnormalities.
- **Emergency Situations**: CT scan if MRI is unavailable and CNS infection or mass lesion is suspected.
- **Functional Imaging**: PET and SPECT for evaluating medically refractory seizures.

### GENETIC TESTING
- **Use**: Diagnose epilepsy syndromes with specific gene mutations, guide therapeutic options.
- **Current Focus**: Mainly infants and children with suspected genetic causes.

### DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF SEIZURES
- **Distinguishing Features**: Careful history and laboratory studies; additional tests like video-EEG monitoring, sleep studies, tilt-table analysis, or cardiac electrophysiology.
- **Common Mimics**:
  - **Syncope**: Distinguished by precipitating factors (pain, stress), brief loss of consciousness, stereotyped transition, and postictal state.
  - **Psychogenic Seizures**: Conversion reactions resembling seizures, differentiated by behaviors, duration, and EEG findings.


### TREATMENT

#### Seizures and Epilepsy

Therapy for seizure disorders is often multimodal, involving treatment of underlying conditions, avoiding precipitating factors, using antiseizure medications or surgery, and addressing psychological and social issues. A neurologist experienced in epilepsy treatment should oversee the strategy, especially for refractory epilepsy or polypharmacy cases.

### TREATMENT OF UNDERLYING CONDITIONS
- **Metabolic Disturbances**: Treat abnormalities in serum electrolytes or glucose. Antiseizure drugs are typically unnecessary unless the disorder can't be corrected promptly.
- **Drug-Induced Seizures**: Avoid the causative drug. Antiseizure medications are unnecessary unless seizures recur without these triggers.
- **Structural CNS Lesions**: Seizures may not recur post-treatment, but antiseizure medication is usually maintained for at least 1 year. Surgical removal of seizure-producing tissue is an option for refractory cases.

### AVOIDANCE OF PRECIPITATING FACTORS
- **Sleep Deprivation**: Optimize sleep quality.
- **Alcohol**: Modify drinking habits if alcohol intake is associated with seizures.
- **Stress Reduction**: Techniques like physical exercise, meditation, or counseling may help.
- **Reflex Epilepsy**: Avoid specific stimuli that trigger seizures (e.g., video games, music).

### ANTISEIZURE DRUG THERAPY

#### When to Initiate Therapy
- **Recurrent Seizures**: Start therapy for recurrent seizures of unknown etiology or known irreversible cause.
- **Single Seizure**: Treatment is controversial; consider factors like brain insult history, EEG abnormalities, significant brain imaging findings, and nocturnal seizures.

#### Selection of Antiseizure Drugs
- **Efficacy and Side Effects**: Consider convenience of dosing, potential side effects, and cost.
- **Common Drugs**: Phenytoin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and ethosuximide are often used as first-line therapy.
- **Newer Drugs**: Typically used as add-on or alternative therapy but can be first-line monotherapy.

#### Drug Selection for Focal Seizures
- **Common Choices**: Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, levetiracetam.
- **Considerations**: Pharmacokinetics, side effects, drug interactions.

#### Drug Selection for Generalized Seizures
- **Initial Choices**: Lamotrigine, valproic acid, levetiracetam.
- **Alternatives**: Topiramate, zonisamide, perampanel, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine.

#### Initiation and Monitoring of Therapy
- **Education**: Patients should be informed about the trial-and-error process to find the optimal medication and dose.
- **Monitoring**: Serum drug levels can guide dosing but clinical response is key.

#### Discontinuing Therapy
- **Criteria**: Complete seizure control for 1–5 years, single seizure type, normal neurologic exam, no family history of epilepsy, normal EEG.
- **Process**: Gradual dose reduction over 2–3 months.

### TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY EPILEPSY
- **Polypharmacy**: Combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action may be required.
- **Third-Line Drugs**: Zonisamide, brivaracetam, topiramate, lacosamide, tiagabine.

### SURGICAL TREATMENT OF REFRACTORY EPILEPSY
- **Candidates**: Patients with focal epilepsy not controlled by medication.
- **Common Procedures**: Temporal lobectomy, amygdalohippocampectomy, lesionectomy, multiple subpial transection, hemispherectomy, corpus callosotomy.
- **Presurgical Evaluation**: Inpatient video-EEG monitoring, high-resolution MRI, functional imaging (SPECT, PET, MEG).

### NEUROSTIMULATION DEVICES
- **Options**: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS).
- **Efficacy**: Significant seizure reduction over time, but seizure freedom is rare.
- **Choice of Device**: Based on patient-specific factors and technology strengths.



### STATUS EPILEPTICUS

Status epilepticus refers to continuous seizures or repetitive, discrete seizures with impaired consciousness between episodes. Subtypes include generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) and nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

#### Definition
- **Traditional**: Seizure activity lasting 15-30 minutes.
- **Practical**: Acute use of anticonvulsant therapy is needed when seizures last beyond 5 minutes.

#### GCSE Management
- **Emergency**: Immediate treatment is crucial to prevent cardiorespiratory dysfunction, hyperthermia, metabolic derangements, and irreversible neuronal injury.
- **Causes**: Anticonvulsant withdrawal, noncompliance, metabolic disturbances, drug toxicity, CNS infection, tumors, refractory epilepsy, head trauma.
- **Diagnosis**: Obvious during overt seizures; subtle signs (e.g., mild clonic movements, rapid eye movements) appear after 30-45 minutes. EEG may be necessary to confirm ongoing status epilepticus.

#### Initial Management Steps
1. Attend to acute cardiorespiratory problems and hyperthermia.
2. Perform brief medical and neurologic examination.
3. Establish venous access.
4. Send samples for laboratory studies to identify metabolic abnormalities.
5. Begin anticonvulsant therapy immediately.

#### Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus
- Less urgent than GCSE, but should still be treated promptly to prevent cellular injury.

### BEYOND SEIZURES: OTHER MANAGEMENT ISSUES

#### EPILEPSY COMORBIDITIES
- **Cognitive Dysfunction**: Includes psychiatric diseases; frequent interictal EEG abnormalities can cause subtle memory and attention dysfunction.
- **Psychiatric Problems**: Depression (∼20% of patients), anxiety, psychosis. Depression should be treated with counseling and/or medication (SSRIs preferred).
- **Postictal Psychosis**: Occurs after increased seizure frequency; usually resolves spontaneously but may require short-term treatment.

#### MORTALITY OF EPILEPSY
- **Increased Risk**: Due to underlying etiology, accidents, status epilepticus, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).
- **SUDEP**: Often affects young people with convulsive seizures, potentially due to brainstem-mediated effects on pulmonary, cardiac, and arousal functions.

#### PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES
- **Stigma**: Education for patients and their associates can help reduce cultural stigma.
- **Employment**: Legal protections exist against employment discrimination; patients should be aware of their rights.
- **Driving**: Patients must be seizure-free for a specific interval (varies by region) before driving. Physicians must inform patients about the risks of driving with uncontrolled seizures.

#### SPECIAL ISSUES RELATED TO WOMEN AND EPILEPSY

##### Catamenial Epilepsy
- **Increased Seizures**: Around menses due to hormonal effects on neuronal excitability. Some women may benefit from adjusted antiseizure drug dosages during this time.

##### Pregnancy
- **Risks**: Seizure frequency changes, potential fetal abnormalities. Close monitoring and appropriate drug therapy are essential.
- **Drug Therapy**: Maintain effective drug therapy to prevent uncontrolled seizures. Monotherapy at the lowest effective dose is preferred, especially during the first trimester.
- **Folate Supplementation**: 1-4 mg/day recommended to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.
- **Vitamin K**: Mothers on enzyme-inducing drugs should take vitamin K in the last 2 weeks of pregnancy; infants receive vitamin K at birth.

##### Contraception
- **Interaction with Antiseizure Drugs**: Certain drugs reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Alternative contraceptive methods or adjusted oral contraceptive medications are recommended.

##### Breast-Feeding
- **Antiseizure Drugs in Breast Milk**: Varying degrees of excretion. Generally encouraged unless adverse effects on the infant are observed.

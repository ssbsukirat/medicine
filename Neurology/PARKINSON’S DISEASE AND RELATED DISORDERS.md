- second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease
- mean age of onset of PD is about 60 years
- frequency of PD increases with age, but cases can be seen in individuals in their twenties and even younger
- characterized by rest tremor, rigidity (stiffness), bradykinesia (slowing), and gait dysfunction with postural instability
- ![[PDclinical.png]]
- Additional clinical features can include freezing of gait, speech difficulty, swallowing impairment, and a series of nonmotor features that include autonomic disturbances, sensory alterations, mood disorders, sleep dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and dementia
- Pathologically, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), reduced striatal dopamine, and intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions in cell bodies and axons that stain for α-synuclein (aka Lewy body )
- can also affect 
    - cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), 
    - norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), 
    - serotonin neurons in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem, and 
    - neurons of the olfactory system, cerebral hemispheres, spinal cord, and peripheral autonomic nervous system
- “nondopaminergic” pathology is likely responsible for the nonmotor clinical features
- begin in the peripheral autonomic nervous system, olfactory system, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve in the lower brainstem, and then spread in a predictable and sequential manner to affect the SNc and cerebral hemispheres (Braak staging)
- symptoms reflecting early involvement of nondopaminergic neurons such as constipation, anosmia, rapid eye movement (REM) behavior sleep disorder, and cardiac denervation can precede the onset of the classic motor features of PD by several years if not decades
# DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
- Parkinsonism is a generic term that is used to define a syndrome manifest by bradykinesia with rigidity and/or tremor.
- ![[PDdifferentials.png]]
- basal ganglia are comprised of a group of subcortical nuclei that include the 
    - striatum (putamen and caudate nucleus),
    - subthalamic nucleus (STN) 
    - globus pallidus pars externa (GPe)
    - pallidus pars interna (GPi)
    - SNc
- Historically, PD was diagnosed based on the presence of two of three parkinsonian features (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia)
- parkinsonism (bradykinesia and rigidity) associated with rest tremor, asymmetry of motor impairment, and a good response to levodopa is much more likely to predict the correct pathologic diagnosis —> ***U.K. Brain Bank Criteria*** 
- Imaging of the dopamine system increases diagnostic accuracy
- MDS Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson’s disease
    - motor parkinsonism has been retained as the core feature of the disease
    - three additional categories of diagnostic features: supportive criteria (features that increase confidence in the diagnosis of PD), absolute exclusion criteria, and red flags (which must be counterbalanced by supportive criteria to permit a diagnosis of PD)
    - two levels of certainty have been delineated; clinically established PD and clinically probable PD
- Imaging of the brain dopamine system
    - using positron emission tomography (PET) or singlephoton emission computed tomography (SPECT)
    - show reduced and asymmetric uptake of striatal dopaminergic biomarkers, particularly in the posterior putamen with relative sparing of the caudate nucleus
    - reflect the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and the loss of their striatal terminals
- diagnosis of PD, and even pre-PD, may be made based on the presence of increased iron in the SNc using transcranial sonography or special MRI protocols 
- genetic form of PD should be considered in patients with a strong positive family history, early age of onset (<40 years), a particular ethnic background
- variants of the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) are the most common genetic association with PD
# Atypical, Secondary, and Other Forms of Parkinsonism
- ![[PDatypical.png]]
- usually associated with more widespread pathology than found in PD (e.g., degeneration of striatum, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and brainstem, as well as the SNc)
- include multiple system atrophy (MSA) progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome
- tend to present with parkinsonism (rigidity and bradykinesia) but manifest clinical differences from PD reflecting their more widespread pathology
- early involvement of speech and gait, absence of rest tremor, lack of motor asymmetry, poor or no response to levodopa, and a more aggressive clinical course
- Neuroimaging of the dopamine system is usually not helpful
- metabolic imaging of the basal ganglia/thalamus network (using 2-F-deoxyglucose) may be helpful, showing a pattern of decreased activity in the GPi with increased activity in the thalamus
- MSA 
    - combination of the atypical parkinsonian features, as well as cerebellar and autonomic features
    - predominantly parkinsonian (MSA-p) or cerebellar (MSA-c) form
    - features of atypical parkinsonism in conjunction with cerebellar signs and/or prominent autonomic dysfunction, usually orthostatic hypotension
    - degeneration of the SNc, striatum, cerebellum, and inferior olivary nuclei
    - characteristic glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) that stain positively for α-synuclein (Lewy bodies) particularly in oligodendrocytes rather than in SNc neurons as in PD
    - MRI can show pathologic iron accumulation in the striatum on T2-weighted scans,
    - high signal change in the region of the external surface of the putamen (putaminal rim) in MSA-p, or 
    - cerebellar and brainstem atrophy (the pontine “hot cross bun” sign) in MSA-c.
- PSP
    - atypical parkinsonism that is characterized by parkinsonism as noted above coupled with slow ocular saccades, eyelid apraxia, and restricted vertical eye movements with particular impairment of downward gaze
    - hyperextension of the neck with early gait disturbance and falls
    - later stages, speech and swallowing difficulty and cognitive impairment may become evident.
    - Two clinical forms of PSP have been identified; a “Parkinson” form that can closely resemble PD in the early stages and can include a positive response to levodopa, and the more classic “Richardson” form that is characterized by the features described above with little or no response to levodopa
    - characteristic atrophy of the midbrain with relative preservation of the pons on midsagittal images — hummingbird sign
    - degeneration of the SNc, striatum, STN, midline thalamic nuclei, and pallidum, coupled with neurofibrillary tangles and inclusions that stain for the tau protein
- CBS 
    - uncommon condition 
    - presents with asymmetric dystonic contractions and clumsiness of one hand coupled with cortical sensory disturbances manifest as apraxia, agnosia, focal limb myoclonus, or 
    - alien limb phenomenon (where the limb assumes a position in space without the patient being aware of its location or recognizing that the limb belongs to them)
    - Dementia may occur at any stage of the disease. 
    - Both cortical and basal ganglia features are required to make this diagnosis
    - Pathologic findings include achromatic neuronal degeneration with tau deposits.
- Secondary parkinsonisms 
    - occur as a consequence of other etiologic factors such as drugs, stroke, tumor, infection, or exposure to toxins (e.g., carbon monoxide, manganese)
    - strokes or tumors that affect the SNc may have a clinical picture that is largely identical to the motor features of PD,
    - carbon monoxide or manganese that damage the globus pallidus more closely resemble atypical parkinsonism
    - ***Dopamine-blocking agents such as neuroleptics are the most common cause of secondary parkinsonism.***
    - Other drugs that can cause secondary parkinsonism include tetrabenazine, calcium channel blockers (flunarizine, cinnarizine), amiodarone, and lithium
- dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD)
    - Parkinsonism maybe a feature 
    - mutation in the GTPCyclohydrolase 1 gene,
    - defect in a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase with impairment in the manufacture of dopa and dopamine
    - Usually has dystonia 
    - present as a biochemically based form of parkinsonism
    - not associated with abnormalities on fluoro-dopa positron emission tomography (FD-PET) nor neurodegeneration.
    - considered in individuals aged <20 years who present with parkinsonism particularly if there are dystonic features
- Others 
    - Wilson’s disease, 
    - Huntington’s disease (especially the juvenile form known as the Westphal variant), 
    - certain spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
    - neurodegenerative disorders with brain iron accumulation such as pantothenate kinase (PANK)associated neurodegeneration (formerly known as Hallervorden-Spatz disease)
- rule out Wilson’s disease, as progression can be prevented with the use of copper chelators
# ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS
- most sporadically (~85–90%) and are of unknown cause
- mutations are the only known causes of PD
- environmental factors might play an important role in patients with an age of onset ≥50 years, with 
- genetic factors being more important in younger-onset patients
- later-onset genetic variants (e.g., LRRK2 and GBA)argues against the emphasis on environmental factors, even in individuals >50 years of age
- 10% of PD cases are familial in origin
- ![[PDgenes.png]]
- may be due to a “double hit” involving an interaction between
	- one or more genetic risk factors that induce susceptibility coupled with 
	- exposure to a toxic environmental factor that may induce epigenetic or somatic DNA alterations or has the potential to directly damage the dopaminergic system

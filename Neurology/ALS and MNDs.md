# Amyortrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
- most common progressive motor neuron disease 
## Pathology 
- pathologic hallmark is death of ***lower motor neurons*** (consisting of *anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and their brainstem homologues innervating bulbar muscles*) and ***upper, or corticospinal, motor neurons*** (originating in *layer five of the motor cortex and descending via the pyramidal tract to synapse with lower motor neurons, either directly or indirectly via interneurons*)
	- initially may have selective loss of either upper or lower but eventually all forms of motor neurons die 
	- in absence of clear involvement of both UMN and LMN, diagnosis is questionable 
	- in some cases ***ALS arises concurrently with frontotemporal dementia*** in these instances, there is degeneration of frontotemporal cortical neurons and corresponding cortical atrophy

	- ![[MNDtypes.png]]
	- ***bulbar palsy and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; also called progressive muscular atrophy)***, the ***lower motor neurons*** of brainstem and spinal cord, respectively, are most severely involved. 
	- By contrast, ***pseudobulbar palsy, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) affect only upper motor neurons*** innervating the brainstem and spinal cord
- Motor neurons undergo **shrinkage**, often with **accumulation of the pigmented lipid (lipofuscin)** that normally develops in these cells with advancing age
- neuron **cytoskeleton** is typically affected early in the illness -- **focal enlargement** common -- "**spheroids**" made of accumulations of **neurofilament** and other proteins 
- affected neurons demonstrate **ubiquitin-positive aggregates**, typically associated with the **protein TDP43** -- **proliferation of astroglia and microglia seen** 
- death of the peripheral motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord leads to **denervation and atrophy of the corresponding muscle fibers** -- early phases of the illness denervated muscle can be **reinnervated by sprouting of nearby distal motor nerve terminals** -- but reinnervation less than in other diseases like poliomyelitis , peripheral neuropathy 
- with disease progress , muscle atrophy is easily recognized visually and on biopsy, hence the name **"amyotrophy"**
- The loss of fibers in the lateral columns and resulting fibrillary gliosis impart a particular firmness **(lateral sclerosis)** 
- **selectivity** of neuronal cell death. By light microscopy, the entire sensory apparatus and cerebellar structures that control the coordination of movement remain intact
- Cognitive areas preserved except in [[Fronto Temporal Dementia]] 
- motor neurons required for ocular motility remain unaffected, as do the parasympathetic neurons in the sacral spinal cord (the nucleus of Onufrowicz, or Onuf) that innervate the sphincters of the bowel and bladder. 
## Clinical 
- Depends on UMN vs LMN predominant 
- LMN dysfunction
	- initially insidious assymetric weakness , usually distally in one limb 
	- recent development of cramping with volitional movement , in early hours of body 
	- progressive wasting and atrophy of muscles and, particularly early in the illness, spontaneous twitching of motor units, or fasciculations 
	- preponderance of extensor over flexor weakness is common
	- if bulbar rather than limb muscles, the problem at onset is difficulty with chewing, swallowing, and movements of the face and tongue
	- rarely initially respiratory muscle weakness may cause death before other symptoms 
- **Corticospinal** involvement predominant
    - hyperactive tendon jerks -- **patient complains of muscle stiffness out of proportion to weakness**
    - Spastic resistance to passive movement
- **Corticobulbar** projections to brainstem -- if degeneration -- **dysarthria and exaggeration of motor expression of emotions** -- involuntary excess of weeping or laughing (pseudobulbar affect)
- With time more muscles involved till it takes a **symmetric distribution** in all regions -- both LMN and UMN will eventually be implicated
- **Sensory, bowel, bladder, cognitive preserved** even late in disease
- **Ocular motility preserved** even in late disease with brainstem involvement
- Diagnostic guidelines
    - world federation of neurology
    - Simultaneous UMN and LMN involvement
    - Progressive weakness
    - Exclude all other diagnosis
    - Definite when 3/4 involved
        - bulbar 
        - Cervical
        - Thoracic
        - Lumbosacral motor neurons
    - Probable if 2/4 
    - Possible if 1/4 
    - If 1/4 + progressive umn and LMN + SOD1(superoxide dismutase)
- CSF markers of neurodegeneration like neurofilament light chains, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains, inflammatory markers like **monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 are elevated** 
## Epidemiology
- median survival 3-5 years 
- Death by respiratory paralysis
- 1-3/100000 incidence, 3-5/100000 prevalence
- Risk factors 
    - exposure to pesticides and insecticide
    - Silica 
    - Smoking
    - Service in military

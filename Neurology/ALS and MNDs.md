# Amyortrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
- most common progressive motor neuron disease 
## Pathology 
- pathologic hallmark is death of ***lower motor neurons*** (consisting of *anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and their brainstem homologues innervating bulbar muscles*) and ***upper, or corticospinal, motor neurons*** (originating in *layer five of the motor cortex and descending via the pyramidal tract to synapse with lower motor neurons, either directly or indirectly via interneurons*)
- initially may have selective loss of either upper or lower but eventually all forms of motor neurons die 
- in absence of clear involvement of both UMN and LMN, diagnosis is questionable 
- in some cases ***ALS arises concurrently with frontotemporal dementia*** in these instances, there is degeneration of frontotemporal cortical neurons and corresponding cortical atrophy

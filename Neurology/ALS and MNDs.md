# Amyortrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
- most common progressive motor neuron disease 
## Pathology 
- pathologic hallmark is death of ***lower motor neurons*** (consisting of *anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and their brainstem homologues innervating bulbar muscles*) and ***upper, or corticospinal, motor neurons*** (originating in *layer five of the motor cortex and descending via the pyramidal tract to synapse with lower motor neurons, either directly or indirectly via interneurons*)
	- initially may have selective loss of either upper or lower but eventually all forms of motor neurons die 
	- in absence of clear involvement of both UMN and LMN, diagnosis is questionable 
	- in some cases ***ALS arises concurrently with frontotemporal dementia*** in these instances, there is degeneration of frontotemporal cortical neurons and corresponding cortical atrophy

	- ***bulbar palsy and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA; also called progressive muscular atrophy)***, the ***lower motor neurons*** of brainstem and spinal cord, respectively, are most severely involved. 
	- By contrast, ***pseudobulbar palsy, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) affect only upper motor neurons*** innervating the brainstem and spinal cord
- Motor neurons undergo **shrinkage**, often with **accumulation of the pigmented lipid (lipofuscin)** that normally develops in these cells with advancing age
- neuron **cytoskeleton** is typically affected early in the illness -- **focal enlargement** common -- "**spheroids**" made of accumulations of **neurofilament** and other proteins 
- affected neurons demonstrate **ubiquitin-positive aggregates**, typically associated with the **protein TDP43** -- **proliferation of astroglia and microglia seen**

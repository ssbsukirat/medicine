Here are notes from the provided chapter:

# Dementia, the Amnesic Syndrome, and the Neurology of Intelligence and Memory

- Neurologists are increasingly consulted as the elderly population rises, due to mental failure impacting work or home function.
- This can indicate degenerative brain disease, brain tumor, multiple strokes, chronic subdural hematomas, drug intoxication, chronic meningoencephalitis (e.g., HIV, syphilis), normal-pressure hydrocephalus, or depressive illness.
- Formerly, little could be done, but now effective treatments exist for several conditions, potentially restoring normal competence.
- Diagnostic technologies allow earlier recognition, improving recovery chances or preventing progression.
- **Dementia** denotes a persistent deterioration of intellectual or cognitive function with little or no disturbance of consciousness or perception.
- In medical parlance, it describes a syndrome of failing memory and other intellectual functions from chronic progressive degenerative brain disease.
- The term more accurately includes intellectual deterioration, behavioral abnormalities, and personality changes.
- Dementia can result from static encephalopathy (e.g., head trauma, cerebral anoxia) or progressive degenerative disease.
- It differs from global confusional state (encephalopathy) in its chronicity.
- A confused, amnestic person is not determined to be demented until deficits persist.
- Dementia and encephalopathy have different causes; degeneration of cerebral neurons is common but one of many causes of dementia.
- Encephalopathy has myriad intrinsic (metabolic) and extrinsic (toxic) causes.

# Intelligence

- Understanding intellectual deterioration requires knowledge of normal intellectual functions, especially intelligence and memory.
- Intelligence, or intelligent behavior, is defined as "general mental efficiency," "innate cognitive ability," or the "aggregate or global capacity of an individual to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment" (Wechsler).
- It is the capacity to have ideas and reason about them.
- It is **global** because it characterizes an individual's behavior as a whole, and an **aggregate** because it comprises independent cognitive abilities.
- Intelligence is disturbed by many brain disorders but cannot be easily attributed to a single cerebral region or function.
- Dementias and developmental delays affect intelligence through widely distributed brain function.
- Intelligence is linked to normal cerebral function and varies between individuals and families.
- Intelligent children excel in school and score high on intelligence tests if motivated.
- The first intelligence tests (Binet and Simon, 1905) predicted scholastic success.
- The term **intelligence quotient (IQ)**, introduced by Stern and used by Terman (1916), is calculated by (mental age / chronologic age up to 14th year) × 100.
- IQ broadly correlates with school achievement and to a lesser extent with professional success.
- Individual IQ increases up to 14-16 years, then stabilizes until late adult life.
- Normal children's test scores follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
- Early pedigree studies supported inherited intelligence but later showed strong environmental influence.
- Tests were less reliable for talented children without optimal opportunities.
- Neither genetic nor purely environmental views are entirely correct.
- Studies of identical twins (reared together or apart) show greater similarity in intelligence than nonidentical twins.
- In elderly twins (>80 years), 62% of cognitive performance was accounted for by shared genetic traits.
- Life experience alters intelligence, but modestly.
- **Genetic endowment is strongly suggested as the more important factor**.
- Early learning also modifies the level of ability attained.
- Intelligence may be viewed as the **product** of genetic and environmental factors.
- Non-scholastic achievement is influenced by factors like curiosity, readiness to learn, interest, persistence, sociability, and ambition/motivation, which are not measured by intelligence tests.

### Genetic Mechanisms

- Limited knowledge exists regarding genetic mechanisms.
- There's an excess of males with developmental delay (formerly mental retardation).
- Several well-characterized syndromes of mental retardation are X-linked.
- Males and females show different performance patterns on subtests (males perform better in spatial ability and certain mathematical tasks).
- Males are more affected by genes on their single X chromosome, while females benefit from the mosaic provided by two X chromosomes.
- High intelligence segregates X-linked in some families.
- Intelligence and intellectual traits will likely prove to be polygenic.

### Neurologic Structure and Function

- Correlation between neurologic structure/function and intelligence is difficult to document, except for pathologically developmentally delayed individuals.
- Brain weight and convolutional pattern complexity do not correlate with intelligence.
- Analyses like that of Albert Einstein's brain have been criticized as oversimplifications.
- Only laboratory measures of vigilance and sensory registration (speed of motor responses, reaction time, rapid recognition of differences) show a consistent but modest correlation with IQ.
- Morphometric features of cortical regions presumed to underlie IQ and verbal skills (e.g., frontal and language areas) show a heritable component on high-resolution MRI scans.

### Psychologic Theories

- **Spearman's two-factor theory:** All separate cognitive ability tests correlated, suggesting a **general factor (g factor)** in all performance. Each test also measures subsidiary **specific factors (s factors)**.
- **Thurstone's multifactorial theory:** Intelligence consists of several separable **primary mental abilities** (e.g., memory, verbal facility, numerical ability, visuospatial perception, problem-solving), which are correlated but not subordinate to a general ability.
- **Eysenck's theory:** Intelligence exists in three forms: **biologic** (genetic), **social** (development of genetic component in personal relationships), and **specific abilities** (measurable by psychometric tests).
- **Gardner's theory** (reframing Thurstone): Separated six categories of high-order cerebral ability, referred to as "intelligences":
    - **Linguistic** (language functions).
    - **Musical** (composition, performance).
    - **Logical–mathematical** (mathematicians' ideas and works).
    - **Spatial** (artistic talent, visual impressions).
    - **Bodily–kinesthetic** (dance, athletic performance).
    - **Personal** (consciousness of self and others).
    - Each intelligence defined as the ability to solve problems/difficulties and be creative within its field.
    - Supporting evidence: (1) each can be developed exceptionally high (virtuosity/genius), (2) each can be destroyed or spared in isolation by a lesion, (3) special competence in prodigies at an early age, (4) selective sparing/development in autistic savants.
    - Each appears to have a genetic basis, but full development is influenced by environmental factors.

### Highest Levels of Intelligence

- Limited data on genius.
- A longitudinal study (1921) of 1,500 schoolchildren with high IQs predicted scholastic accomplishments but not occupational or life success.
- Most recognized geniuses excel in one domain (e.g., painting, linguistics, music, chess, mathematics); "domain genius" is not necessarily predicted by high IQ scores.
- Some individuals display crossmodal superiorities, especially in mathematics and music.

### Developmental Aspects

- **Piaget's theory:** Intelligence emerges in discrete age-related stages: sensorimotor (0-2 years), preconceptual thought (2-4 years), intuitive thought (4-7 years), concrete operations (7-11 years), and formal operations (11+ years, logical/abstract thought).
- This scheme implies logical thought capacity is gene-coded and develops predictably.
- Piaget's theory has been criticized as anecdotal, lacking quantitative validation from large populations.
- It does not account for individual special abilities that develop at different times than general intellectual capacities.

### Neurologic Verification of Intelligence Theories

- Neurology, by understanding cerebrum diseases, might verify intelligence theories and anatomy.
- Spearman's g factor would be maximally impaired by diffuse lesions proportional to brain mass involved (Lashley's "mass-action principle").
- There is a correlation between lost brain tissue volume and general cerebral function deficit.
- Some disagree, claiming no universal psychologic deficit linked to specific brain lesions.
- The truth likely lies between these views.
- Vascular lesions (>50 mL) in the aging brain cause a moderate general reduction in performance, especially speed and problem-solving.
- Other studies found correlations only between specific intellectual deficits and lesions in particular parts of the left and right hemispheres.
- Lesions of the frontal lobes, especially prefrontal regions, disorder planning and "executive" functions; they do not measurably affect overall IQ but slow mental processing and degrade related subtests.
- Intelligence consists of a combination of multiple primary abilities, each possibly inherited, with separate but poorly delineated anatomical representation.
- Authors disagree with Thurstone and Gardner that these special abilities are of equivalent weight for general "intelligence".
- Linguistic, mathematical, and spatial–dimensional abilities are more integral to ideation and problem-solving.
- These are most affected in the developmentally delayed and lost early in dementing diseases.
- Spearman's g factor is credible for general mental performance involving abstract symbols but is not a fully satisfying concept for intelligence.
- Neurologic data, while unable to locate sources of a general intelligence factor, does not exclude its possibility.
- If frontal lobe connections are intact, attention, drive, and motivation (noncognitive attributes) reside there and are fundamental to performance.
- Parietal lobe associative areas process sensory experiences and manipulate them symbolically.
- Relating thoughts and stored concepts involves memory, symbols, and names, requiring full temporal lobe function.

### Creativity

- Creativity is a complex problem in neurologic analysis.
- It is tied to special skills, similar to Gardner's modality-based intelligence, especially for artistic work.
- Brain structures involved in aesthetics and abstraction are obscure.
- Intelligence and problem-solving ability are only roughly tied to creativity.
- Congenital absences and deficiencies of appreciation for visual, artistic, or mathematical skills exist.
- Creativity can be inhibited by other brain functions, as seen in a woman with frontotemporal dementia whose artistic abilities emerged as her language deteriorated.
- Like intelligence, creativity almost certainly does not reside in a particular lobe or structure of the brain.
- It may depend on the overdevelopment of certain associative areas and frontal lobe drive.
- Creativity is fully manifest only through exposure and encouragement.

# The Neurology of Dementia

- Dementia is a syndrome characterized by the loss of several separable but overlapping intellectual abilities, presenting in various combinations.
- An operational definition is cognitive impairment severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living.
- These intellectual deficits are the primary clinical abnormalities of many cerebral diseases, sometimes the only ones.
- Table 20-1 lists common types of dementing diseases and their approximate frequencies:
    - **Cerebral atrophies** (mainly Alzheimer, also Lewy body, Parkinson, fronto-temporal dementia): **50%**.
    - Multi-infarct dementia: 10%.
    - Alcoholic dementia: 7%.
    - Intracranial tumors: 5%.
    - Normal-pressure hydrocephalus: 5%.
    - Huntington chorea: 2%.
    - Chronic drug intoxications: 3%.
    - Miscellaneous diseases (hepatic failure, pernicious anemia, hypo/hyperthyroidism, ALS, amyloid angiopathy, neurosyphilis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, multiple sclerosis, chronic epilepsy): 6%.
    - Cerebral trauma: 2%.
    - AIDS dementia: 2%.
    - Pseudodementias (depression, hypomania, schizophrenia, hysteria, undiagnosed): 8%.
- Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is highly accurate (>80% confirmed postmortem) when rigid research criteria are used.
- The high frequency of Alzheimer disease in the older population contributes to the likelihood of correct diagnosis.

### Mild Cognitive Impairment and Early Dementia

- Many individuals have mild memory complaints disproportionate for age/education, but not interfering with daily functioning.
- This condition is called **mild cognitive impairment (MCI)**, formerly age-associated memory impairment or benign senescent forgetfulness.
- Defining its boundaries and risk of progression to dementia is problematic.
- Highly intelligent individuals may experience significant decline on tests before falling below age-adjusted norms.
- Alzheimer disease and MCI are believed to exist in a spectrum.
- Identifying patients in the presymptomatic period of Alzheimer disease offers potential for early treatment.
- Common complaints of forgetting keys or names as one ages generally do not indicate cognitive decline.
- Factors contributing to such complaints in the normal population include poor sleep/sleep apnea, depression, medication side effects, systemic endocrine/infectious disorders, and general distractibility.
- **10-20% per year** of patients with mild cognitive decline later develop Alzheimer disease.
- Factors associated with progression to dementia include elevated blood pressure, cerebral white matter changes on MRI, gait abnormality, and specific biologic markers linked to Alzheimer disease.
- Clinicians should counsel caution and reassurance and exclude treatable causes of memory impairment.
- If symptoms are progressive or consistently interfere with other mental functions or daily activities, a dementing illness is likely.

### Dementia Caused by Degenerative Diseases

- Earliest signs of degenerative dementia can be subtle and unnoticed by physicians.
- An observant relative or employer may notice a lack of initiative, disinterest in work, neglect of tasks, or abandonment of hobbies.
- Initially, these changes may be attributed to depression, fatigue, or retirement boredom.
- Often, **gradual development of forgetfulness** is the most prominent early symptom, exceeding what is typical for mild cognitive impairment.
- Patients may struggle with balancing a checkbook, simple calculations, forget errand purposes, miss appointments, and overlook recent conversations.
- Repetitive questioning of already answered information is characteristic.
- Later, patients become easily distracted, struggle to think/discuss problems clearly, and cannot comprehend complex situations.
- Their ability to make deductions and inferences is greatly reduced.
- Minor events may cause unreasonable concern.
- Tasks requiring multiple steps become impossible, and only the simplest directions can be followed.
- Patients may get lost even on familiar routes.
- Day-to-day events are not recalled, and perseveration or impersistence in speech, action, and thought become evident.
- Diminished capacity for abstraction, attention, planning, and problem-solving (executive functions) may be observed.
- An early abnormality can be emotional instability, such as outbursts of anger, easy tearfulness, or aggressiveness.
- Mood changes toward depression and apathy are common. Some patients are irascible, a few cheerful and facetious.
- Excessive lability of affect (e.g., rapid fluctuation from laughter to tears) may be observed.
- Many patients present with physical complaints like dizziness, mental "fogginess," and headaches.
- Inability to give a coherent symptom account may indicate dementia.
- Sleep disturbances, especially insomnia, are prominent, and acting out dreams during REM sleep marks some degenerative dementias.
- Severe confusional states can be precipitated by febrile illness, head injury, surgery, or new medication.
- Families often mistakenly date the abrupt onset of dementia to these intercurrent events.
- Loss of social graces and indifference to social customs typically occur later, though with exceptions.
- Judgment becomes impaired, early in some cases, late in others.
- Suspiciousness or frank paranoia may develop, sometimes as an early indication.
- Paranoid ideas persist throughout the illness.
- Visual and auditory hallucinations, sometimes vivid, may be added, typical of late disease but an early feature in certain dementias.
- Wandering, pacing, and aimless activities are common in the intermediate stage, while other patients may sit placidly.
- Patients at this point often lack insight into their condition.
- As the condition progresses, all intellectual faculties become impaired; memory is most affected in common neurodegenerative diseases.
- Deference to a family member when unable to answer questions is characteristic.
- Memories of the distant past are relatively retained when more recently acquired information is lost (Ribot’s law).
- Eventually, patients also fail to retain remote memories, recognize relatives, or recall their children's names.

### Clinical Variants

- **Language functions** are impaired almost from the beginning in primary progressive aphasias, and fragments of this problem appear in nondescript and amnestic dementias.
- **Apraxias and agnosias** are early and prominent in one group of neurodegenerative conditions, appearing later in Alzheimer disease. These defects can alter performance of simple tasks (e.g., preparing meals, dressing, walking).
- Several clinical variants of dementia with relatively spared memory have been recognized, now subsumed under **frontotemporal lobar degeneration**: frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, and semantic dementia.
- In aphasic cases, the capacity to understand nuances of spoken/written word is lost, as are suppleness and spontaneity of verbal expression.
- Vocabulary becomes restricted, conversation may be rambling and repetitious.
- Patients grope for names and nouns, no longer formulating ideas with well-constructed phrases.
- They resort to clichés and stereotyped phrases, masking the underlying defect.
- Paraphasias and difficulty comprehending complex conversations become prominent later.
- More severe aphasia, dysarthria, palilalia, and echolalia may be added.
- Loss of capacity to express feelings, suppress impulses, and tolerate frustration/restrictions can occur.
- A common syndrome includes features of frontal lobe degeneration: early personality changes (apathy or disinhibition, euphoria), perseveration in tasks, ritualistic behaviors, and laconic speech leading to mutism, with initial relative preservation of memory, orientation, and visuospatial capability.
- Anterior temporal lobe involvement can lead to hyperorality, excessive smoking/overeating, anxiety, depression, and anomia.
- In advanced stages, restraining patients can lead to disagreeable behavior, petulance, agitation, shouting, and whining.
- Nighttime confusion, inverted sleep patterns, and increased confusion/restlessness in the early evening ("sundowning") are well-known.
- Any febrile illness, drug intoxication, anesthesia, surgery, or metabolic upset is poorly tolerated, leading to severe confusion or stupor, indicating precarious cerebral compensation.

### Physical Deterioration in Dementing Illnesses

- Abnormalities in degenerative dementing diseases are not confined to the intellectual sphere.
- In advancing stages, patients may appear unkempt, unbathed, bewildered, or have a vacant expression, lacking lively interest or participation.
- Movements may be slightly slow, suggesting an oncoming parkinsonian syndrome.
- Sooner or later, gait is characteristically altered in many dementias.
- Passive limb movements encounter fluctuating resistance (paratonia or gegenhalten).
- Mouthing movements and abnormal reflexes (grasping, sucking, snout, bulldog, corneomandibular, palmomental) occur with increasing frequency in advanced stages.
- Many of these reflexes are motor disinhibitions appearing with premotor area involvement.
- In very late stages, physical deterioration is inexorable.
- Food intake, initially increased to gluttony, eventually reduces, leading to emaciation.
- Patients become bedridden, oblivious, and often succumb to pneumonia or other intercurrent infections.
- Some become virtually **decorticate**: totally unaware of surroundings, unresponsive, mute, incontinent, adopting a flexion posture. They lie with eyes open but do not look about; food/drink are swallowed if placed in mouth.
- The term "persistent vegetative state" applies to these patients.
- Occasionally, diffuse choreoathetotic movements, truncal dystonia, or myoclonic jerks are observed, and seizures occur in a few advanced cases.
- Pain or uncomfortable posture goes unheeded.
- The course of Alzheimer disease typically extends for **5 to 10 years or more** from the time memory defect becomes evident.
- In nursing homes, advanced dementia patients with pneumonia, febrile episodes, or eating disorders had high mortality rates (~50% in 6 months).
- The exact sequence of symptoms varies; impaired language, memory with intact reasoning, or apathy/abulia may be dominant early features.
- Gait disorder, usually late, may occur early, especially with frontal lobe degeneration, Parkinson disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, cerebellar ataxia, or progressive supranuclear palsy.
- Symptomatology varies because types of degenerative disease do not affect brain parts equally.
- Frank psychosis with delusions and hallucinations may be woven into dementia, characteristic of diseases like Lewy-body dementia.
- Intellectual and behavioral alterations are direct consequences of neuronal loss (primary manifestations).
- Some symptoms are secondary, representing the patient's reactions to mental incapacity (e.g., seeking solitude, excessive orderliness, apprehension from restricted life).
- Neuropsychologic tests quantify abnormalities in early and intermediate stages.

### Subcortical Dementia

- McHugh introduced the concept of **subcortical dementia**.
- Cognitive decline in predominantly basal ganglionic diseases (e.g., progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington chorea, Parkinson disease) differs from cortical dementia (e.g., Alzheimer disease).
- Subcortical dementia features include mild forgetfulness, slowed thought processes, lack of initiative, and depression of mood, alongside motility disorders and involuntary movements.
- Vocabulary, naming, and praxis are relatively spared in subcortical dementias.
- Cortical dementias (e.g., Alzheimer disease) are distinguished by more severe memory, language, and calculation disturbances, prominent apraxia/agnosia, and impaired abstract thought.
- Pathologic changes underlying subcortical dementia predominate in the basal ganglia, thalamus, rostral brainstem nuclei, and white matter projections to the cortex (especially frontal lobes).
- The term "subcortical dementia" can be misleading, implying lesions are confined to subcortical structures; "non-cortical dementia" might be more apt.
- No neurodegenerative dementia is strictly cortical or subcortical; Alzheimer changes can extend beyond the cortex.
- Lesions produce effects by interrupting neural links to the frontal and other cerebral cortex parts.
- Lewy-body disease and normal-pressure hydrocephalus present ambiguity, having features that could be construed as both cortical and subcortical.
- The concept has been criticized, with arguments that distinctions are not fundamental and differences are due to severity.
- However, many clinical studies indicate differing cognitive impairment constellations, making the clinical distinction based on relative sparing of cortical functions useful.

### Pathogenesis of Dementia

- Attempts to link general intellectual function impairment to specific brain regions or pathology have largely been unsuccessful.
- Lashley's concept of intelligence loss proportional to brain damage has been mentioned.
- Components of the cognitive apparatus, particularly memory, are localizable, but the integrated capacity to think defies easy attribution to one brain part.
- Two main difficulties obstruct progress: defining intellectual functions and the diffuse/complex pathology of dementing diseases.
- **Memory impairment**, a central feature, occurs with extensive disease in various cerebrum parts, but the integrity of discrete diencephalon and medial temporal lobes is fundamental.
- **Language function impairment** is associated with disease of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, especially perisylvian frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.
- **Loss of reading/calculation capacity** relates to lesions in the posterior dominant cerebral hemisphere.
- **Loss of tool use/gesture imitation (apraxias)** relates to tissue loss in the dominant parietal region.
- **Drawing/construction impairment** is observed with parietal lobe lesions, more often right-sided.
- **Problems with behavior modulation and personality stability** generally relate to frontal lobe degeneration.
- The clinical picture depends on lesion location and extent.
- Degenerative dementias relate to structural diseases of the cerebral cortex, with implications for the diencephalon and basal ganglia.
- Rarely, pure thalamic degenerations can cause dementia due to the thalamus's integral relationship to the cerebral cortex, especially regarding memory.
- Even when a disease primarily affects one brain part, additional areas often contribute to mental decline.
- In Alzheimer disease, main damage is in the hippocampus, but degeneration of cholinergic nuclei in the basal frontal region (projecting to the hippocampus) significantly augments memory deterioration.
- Replacement of lost cholinergic influence is a treatment approach for Alzheimer disease.
- **Arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease** differs from neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in multiple infarct foci throughout the thalami, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebrum.
- Arteriosclerosis _per se_ (without vascular occlusion/infarction) is not a cause of progressive dementia.
- Cumulative effects of recurrent strokes impair intellect (multi-infarct or vascular dementia), usually with a stroke-by-stroke advance.
- It's hypothesized that small strokes may exaggerate or induce an Alzheimer neuropathologic process, as the two often coincide.
- Lesions of **severe cerebral trauma** (if causing dementia) are found in cerebral convolutions (frontal/temporal poles), corpus callosum, and thalamus.
- Widespread degeneration of deep cerebral hemispheres can occur due to mechanical disruption of deep white matter (**axonal shearing or diffuse axonal injury**).
- Most traumatic lesions causing dementia are extensive, making localization difficult.
- Thalamic lesions are important, but diffuse axonal shearing in cerebral white matter is often viewed as the primary cause of traumatic dementia.
- Mechanisms other than overt brain tissue destruction:
    - **Chronic hydrocephalus** is often associated with general cognitive impairment, possibly due to compression of cerebral white matter.
    - **Extrinsic compression** by chronic subdural hematomas can have the same effect.
    - A **diffuse inflammatory process** underlies dementia in syphilis, cryptococcosis, other chronic meningitides, and viral infections (HIV encephalitis, herpes simplex encephalitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis). This presumably involves neuron loss and functional derangement of remaining neurons.
    - **Prion diseases** (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) cause widespread cortical neuron loss, gliosis, spongiform change, and characteristic cognitive dysfunction.
- Adult forms of **leukodystrophy** cause a dementing state, typically a subcortical dementia syndrome with prominent frontal lobe features.
- Extensive white matter lesions can result from advanced multiple sclerosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalitis, or some vascular dementias (e.g., Binswanger disease).
- Several **metabolic and toxic disorders** (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency) can interfere with nervous function over time, creating a clinical picture similar to dementias. In these cases, altered biochemical environment likely affects neuronal function in critical areas.

### Classification of the Dementing Diseases

- Dementing diseases are conventionally classified by cause, specific pathologic changes, or most prominent clinical feature (e.g., memory loss in Alzheimer).
- A practical approach divides diseases into categories based on neurologic signs and associated clinical/laboratory features (Table 20-3):
    1. **Dementia with medical disease**.
    2. **Dementia accompanied by other principal neurologic signs**.
    3. **Dementia as the sole or predominant feature** of the illness.
- This "bedside classification" (Table 20-3) may seem dated but is considered more useful for physicians facing diverse causes of dementia.
    - **I. Diseases where dementia is associated with clinical and laboratory signs of other medical diseases:**
        - AIDS–HIV infection
        - Endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, Cushing, rare hypopituitarism, Hashimoto encephalopathy)
        - Nutritional deficiency states (Wernicke-Korsakoff, subacute combined degeneration, pellagra)
        - Chronic meningoencephalitis (general paresis, meningovascular syphilis, cryptococcosis)
        - Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson disease, acquired)
        - Chronic drug and environmental intoxications (including CO poisoning)
        - Prolonged hypoglycemia or hypoxia
        - Paraneoplastic “limbic” encephalitis
        - Heavy metal exposure (arsenic, bismuth, gold, manganese, mercury)
        - Dialysis dementia (now rare)
    - **II. Diseases where dementia is associated with other neurologic signs but not with obvious medical diseases:**
        - **A. Invariably associated with other neurologic signs:**
            - Huntington chorea (choreoathetosis)
            - Multiple sclerosis, Schilder disease, adrenal leukodystrophy, and related demyelinative diseases (spastic weakness, pseudobulbar palsy, blindness)
            - Lipid-storage diseases (myoclonic seizures, blindness, spasticity, cerebellar ataxia)
            - Myoclonic epilepsy (diffuse myoclonus, generalized seizures, cerebellar ataxia)
            - Subacute spongiform encephalopathy; Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease (prion, myoclonic dementias)
            - Cerebrocerebellar degeneration (cerebellar ataxia)
            - Cerebrobasal ganglionic degenerations (apraxia-rigidity)
            - Dementia with spastic paraplegia
            - Progressive supranuclear palsy (falls, vertical gaze palsy)
            - Parkinson disease
            - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and ALS-Parkinson-dementia complex
            - Other rare metabolic diseases, including polyglucosan disease and leukodystrophies
        - **B. Often associated with other neurologic signs:**
            - Multiple thrombotic or embolic cerebral infarctions and Binswanger disease
            - Brain tumor (primary or metastatic) or abscess
            - Brain trauma (cerebral contusions, midbrain hemorrhages, chronic subdural hematoma)
            - Lewy-body disease (parkinsonian features)
            - Communicating, normal pressure, or obstructive hydrocephalus (usually with ataxia of gait)
            - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalitis
            - Marchiafava-Bignami disease (often with apraxia and other frontal lobe signs)
            - Granulomatous and other vasculitides of the brain
    - **III. Diseases where dementia is usually the only evidence of neurologic or medical diseases:**
        - Alzheimer disease
        - Frontotemporal dementia
        - Some cases of HIV–AIDS
        - Progressive aphasia syndromes
        - Frontotemporal and “frontal lobe” dementias associated with tau deposition, Alzheimer change, or with no specific pathologic alteration
        - Degenerative disease of unspecified type

### Differential Diagnosis (General Approach)

- Certain symptom/neurologic sign combinations are characteristic and aid diagnosis.
- Diagnosis relies on patient age, onset mode, clinical course/time span, associated neurologic signs, and accessory laboratory/imaging data.
- Rarer degenerative brain diseases are mainly recognized by pathologic examination or genetic testing.
- **The correct diagnosis of treatable forms of dementia is of greater practical importance than untreatable ones**.
    - Treatable forms include subdural hematoma, certain brain tumors, chronic drug intoxication, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, HIV (partially reversible), neurosyphilis, cryptococcosis, pellagra, vitamin B12 and thiamine deficiency, hypothyroidism, and other metabolic/endocrine disorders.
- Detecting depressive illness (may masquerade as dementia) and chronic drug/chemical intoxication (both treatable) is also important.
- Progressive deafness or loss of sight in elderly can sometimes be misinterpreted as dementia.
- Future advancements will include refined methods to differentiate fundamental causes when effective treatments for degenerative dementias become available.
- The first task is to verify intellectual deterioration and personality change. Serial examinations may be needed to confirm chronicity.
- A mild aphasia from a focal brain lesion should not be mistaken for dementia; careful attention to language performance usually leads to correct diagnosis.
- Abrupt onset of cognitive symptoms usually points to delirium, acute confusional state, or stroke, often with inattention, perceptual disturbances, and drowsiness.
- Avoid assuming normal mental function if a patient only complains of anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, or vague somatic symptoms; these psychiatric disorders rarely have onset in middle/late adult life.
- **Clues for depression:** frequent sighing, crying, energy loss, psychomotor underactivity or agitation, persecutory delusions, hypochondriasis, history of depression.
    - Depressed patients may complain of memory failure but recall illness details and show little qualitative change in other intellectual functions.
    - Their difficulty is due to lack of energy/interest or preoccupation, preventing attention focus.
    - Performance on mental tests may be impaired by "emotional blocking".
    - Mental function improves when calmed/encouraged, indicating no intellectual deterioration.
- Conversely, demented patients in mid-stages rarely have sufficient insight to complain of mental deterioration; if they admit poor memory, it's without conviction.
- Physicians must not rely on patient statements alone, and should seek family corroboration.
- Personality and behavior changes (e.g., in Huntington disease or frontotemporal dementia) can precede or mask early intellectual deterioration.
- Neuropsychiatric symptoms of metabolic, endocrine, or toxic disorders (e.g., Cushing, B12 deficiency, hypercalcemia, uremia) can vary, making diagnosis difficult.
- Drowsiness, stupor, and asterixis are surest signs of metabolic/drug-induced encephalopathy, but not always present.
- Psychosis with hallucinations and fluctuating behavior also suggests an exogenously caused confusional state, with Lewy-body dementia being an exception.
- Thorough medication review is crucial if a metabolic/toxic disorder is suspected (e.g., atropinic drugs can worsen dementia).
- Occupational exposure to toxins/heavy metals should be explored, but it's an infrequent cause.
- Seizures are not a usual component of degenerative dementias and generally appear only at very late stages.
- Once dementia is confirmed, the next step is to determine other neurologic signs or medical disease indications to classify the case.
- Leading neurologic features indicative of particular degenerative dementias:
    - **Early prominent parkinsonian signs** (bradykinesia, tremor, shortened step): characteristic of subcortical dementias (Lewy body, Parkinson diseases).
    - **Limb rigidity and apraxia**: point to corticobasal degeneration.
    - **Early aphasia or visuospatial difficulty** (geographic confusion, drawing, copying, face/object recognition): characteristic of focal degeneration of parietal or inferior temporal lobes.
    - **Frequent falls and vertical eye movement disorder**: core components of progressive supranuclear palsy, often with attendant dementia.
    - **Involuntary movements** (choreoathetosis, dystonia, ataxia, myoclonus): signs of Huntington disease, hepatocerebral degenerations, and prion disease.
    - In nondegenerative categories, **spasticity and Babinski signs** are typical of vascular dementias.

### Ancillary Examinations

- CT, MRI, CSF examination (for tau and amyloid), and blood tests (BUN, calcium, electrolytes, liver function) should be performed.
- Brain MRI and CT are important for diagnosing hydrocephalus, lobar atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, tumor, and subdural hematoma.
- Functional imaging (PET, including with radioligands to amyloid/tau) is gaining importance in identifying Alzheimer, Lewy body, and corticobasal degeneration.
- Routine testing for syphilis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and thyroid function is common due to simplicity and treatability of related dementias.
- Supplemented by HIV serology, copper/ceruloplasmin levels (Wilson disease), heavy metal concentrations, autoantibodies for autoimmune/paraneoplastic encephalitis, and drug toxicology screening.
- The final step is to determine the specific disease from the total clinical picture.

# The Amnesic Korsakoff Syndrome

- "Amnesic syndrome" and "Korsakoff syndrome" are used interchangeably to describe a unique cognitive disorder where memory and learning are greatly impaired, almost in isolation from other mental functions and behavior.
- The amnesic state (Ribot) has two main features:
    1. **Impaired ability to recall events/information established before illness onset (retrograde amnesia)**.
    2. **Inability to acquire new information or form new memories (anterograde amnesia)**. Memory and learning are inseparable.
- A third feature, contingent on retrograde amnesia, is **impaired temporal localization** of past experience.
- Other cognitive functions, such as concentration, spatial organization, visual and verbal abstraction, which rely) allows digit repetition but primarily measures attention and registration.
- **Remote memory is relatively less affected than recent memory (Ribot rule)**.

### Confabulation

- **Creative falsification of memory** in an alert, responsive individual is often included but **not a requisite for diagnosis** of Korsakoff amnesic state.
- It can be provoked by questions about recent activities, with replies being inaccurately localized past events.
- Less frequent but more dramatic is spontaneous recital of fantasies ("fantastic confabulation").
- Fantastic confabulation was observed mainly in the initial, profoundly confused phase of alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome.
- In the chronic, stable stage, confabulation was rarely elicitable.
- Therefore, confabulation is not an obligate feature of Korsakoff syndrome.

### Neuropsychology of Memory

- Memory function obeys neurologic laws; as it fails, it first loses hold on recent events.
- The extent of retrograde amnesia is generally proportionate to the underlying neurologic disorder.
- Early life memories are better preserved and often integrated into habitual responses.
- With natural aging, there is also a gradual loss of early life memories.
- In transitory amnesias (e.g., concussive head injury), memories recover in reverse order (remote then recent).
- The enduring nature of early life memories compared to recent material (restatement of Ribot's law) is apparent in normal adults and demented patients. Ribot stated in 1882 that "the progressive destruction of memory follows a logical order—a law—it begins at the most recent recollections which, being rarely repeated and having no permanent associations, represent organization in its feeblest form".
- Memory is not a unitary function but takes several forms.
- A practical classification distinguishes **immediate recall** from other types of memory.
- **Short-term memory** (or working memory) involves holding information briefly, like a phone number or intermediate sums in calculations.
- **Long-term memory** is divided into:
    - **Explicit memory** (conscious awareness of learning):
        - **Episodic (or autobiographical) memory:** Ability to retain and recount consciously experienced events, including time and circumstances of acquisition.
        - **Semantic memory:** Learning the nature of the environment and factual knowledge (e.g., shape/color of a lion), where the event of acquisition cannot be recalled.
    - **Implicit memory** (not conscious of acquiring memory):
        - **Procedural memory:** Acquisition of physical skills (e.g., driving, playing tennis), referred to as "knowing how" (Cohen and Squire).
        - Classical conditioning is another type of implicit memory.
- A patient unable to learn new information can still acquire simple manual and pattern-analyzing skills (procedural memory), without recalling the circumstances of acquisition.
- The separation of episodic from semantic memory is supported by cases like young patients with bilateral hippocampal damage (from hypoxic-ischemic injury) who showed severe episodic impairment but preserved semantic memory. Patient H. M. (bilateral medial temporal lobectomy) had similar findings. Episodic memory is most affected in these amnesias, early Alzheimer, and limbic encephalitis.
- Lack of uniformity in defining memory terms is a pervasive problem.
- Episodic memory refers to dating personal experiences and their temporal relationships; semantic memory is a repository of perceptual and factual knowledge for language comprehension and inferences. Korsakoff himself recognized retention of semantic memory despite profound episodic impairment.
- The full significance of these categorizations is still under study; categorical purity of semantic memory and strict dichotomy between semantic/episodic memory are questioned.
- Neuropsychologists subdivide memory further, suggesting corresponding anatomic regions (Table 20-4):
    - **Immediate Recall:** Repetition function, conscious access, ==involved dominant perisylvian cortex. Disturbed by agitation, confusion.==
    - **Working Memory:** Short-term recall of objects, plans, names, sequencing. Conscious access, involved ==prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobes, dorsomedial thalamus. Disturbed by Wernicke-Korsakoff, herpes encephalitis, hippocampal/dorsomedial thalamic infarction.==
    - **Explicit Memory:**
        - **Semantic:** Recall for facts and relationships. Conscious access, involved ==anterior/inferior temporal lobes, frontal lobes. Disturbed by AD, frontotemporal dementia, encephalitis, chronic toxins, tumors.==
        - **Episodic:** Recall for temporally organized events. Conscious access, involved ==association cortex. Disturbed by hippocampal infarction, alcoholic Korsakoff, AD, CNS degenerative disorders, encephalitis, chronic toxic exposure, tumors.==
    - **Implicit Memory:**
        - **Procedural:** Operational recall ("how to do"). Usually no conscious access, involved ==premotor/motor cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum. Disturbed by AD, other CNS degenerative disorders, encephalitis, chronic toxic exposure, tumors.==
        - **Visual:** Recall of visual representations. Conscious access, involved ==occipital lobes. Disturbed by AD, other CNS degenerative disorders, encephalitis, tumors.==
- Working memory has clinical and neuropsychologic credibility; it relates to capacity to register and attend to a task. Several brain regions are active in working memory tasks (hippocampi, dorsal thalamus), but dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lesions specifically impair this skill.
- Episodic memory for spatial and topographic information can be dissociated to some degree from memory of the scene's topographic arrangement, but often they are bound.
- A disproportionate degradation of learned topographic/directional information compared to semantic material can be found in patients with right hippocampus injuries (semantic material more dependent on left hippocampus).

### Anatomic Basis of the Amnesic Syndrome

- Two structures are centrally important in memory function: **hippocampal formations** (medial temporal lobes, including parahippocampal gyrus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex) and the **thalamus** (specifically anterior and dorsomedial nuclei).
- Discrete bilateral lesions in these regions derange memory/learning disproportionately. Even a unilateral lesion, especially of the dominant hemisphere, can produce a lesser effect.
- These structures are linked by the fornix (hippocampus to mammillary bodies) and the mammillothalamic tract (mammillary bodies to anterior thalamic nuclei).
- Other regions involved in memory include the anterior septal gray matter (midline nuclei at the base of frontal lobes), whose damage causes a severe but less enduring memory defect.
- The amnesic syndrome following ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm is due to disruption of these septal nuclei. This basal frontal amnesic syndrome is initially severe but has potential for almost complete recovery.
- Human observations confirm the fundamental importance of hippocampal and thalamic structures.
- Monkey studies with the "delayed nonmatching-to-sample task" show memory impairment with lesions of the mediodorsal thalamus and inferomedial temporal cortical regions.
- Bilateral hippocampal formation lesions cause enduring memory impairment.
- Lesions confined to fornices or mammillary bodies, or stereotaxic lesions of the amygdala (sparing adjacent cortices), do not produce a memory defect.
- Lesions restricted to perirhinal and entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex do cause persistent memory defect, presumably by interrupting afferent pathways to the hippocampus.
- Experimental lesions of the anteromedial thalamus also abolish memory function.
- In humans, isolated infarctions of the left mammillothalamic tract most consistently affect memory (verbal tasks), while isolated medial dorsal nucleus lesions cause consistent but less severe defects, affirming the primacy of these two structures in lasting memory defects.
- Subtle differences in memory disturbance exist based on lesion location; pure thalamic lesions may affect anterograde learning more than retrograde recall. Differences are subtle, mainly pertaining to temporal ordering and information modality.
- Functional neuroimaging shows hippocampal formations are consistently engaged during memory acquisition/retrieval.
- Differential activation: right hippocampus for topographic spatial information, left for autobiographical memory.
- London taxi drivers studies suggest larger right hippocampus volume with more navigation experience.
- The integrity of hippocampal formations and anterior/dorsomedial thalamic nuclei is essential for normal memory/learning. These are sites where the smallest lesions have the most devastating effects.
- Normal memory involves many brain parts beyond diencephalic–hippocampal structures.
- Neocortical lesions can impair specific memory forms.
    - Dominant temporal lobe lesion: impairs word memory (explicit semantic).
    - Inferior parietal lobule lesion: undermines written/printed word recognition and relearning.
    - Dominant parietal lobe: recollection of geometric figures and numbers.
    - Nondominant parietal lobe: visuospatial relations.
    - Inferoposterior temporal lobes: face recognition.
    - Dominant posterofrontal region: acquiring/remembering motor skills and affective associations.
- The integrity of both the hippocampal–thalamic system and appropriate cortical regions is required for memory; only the former is integrated into all modalities of learning and retrieval.
- The Korsakoff amnesic state's memory defect is never complete.
- Certain past memories can be recalled imperfectly, without normal temporal relationships, leading to confabulation.
- Long-standing social habits, automatic motor skills, and memory for words/visual impressions are unimpaired.
- Long periods of repetition/usage make implicit/procedural memories automatic, no longer requiring diencephalic–hippocampal structures.
- This suggests these special memories are stored/filed in other brain regions (regional, cellular, subcellular anatomy) through relearning/habituation.
- Unanswered questions remain, such as why disease impairs future learning and wipes out past memories. It's likely the encoding and access mechanisms are obliterated, not the memories themselves.
- Electrical stimulation of the entorhinal area has shown memory enhancement (e.g., improved topographic-spatial landmark retention). This confirms the role of parahippocampal regions (perforant pathways) in forming and stabilizing memories.
- A memory is understood not to reside in a single neuron, but perhaps in connections between neuron ensembles in medial temporal lobes and modality-specific neurons in associative cortices.
- Strengthening synaptic connections (e.g., long-term potentiation) is thought to establish memory.
- The precise role of hippocampal neurons (trigger or generic cohering) and cellular mechanisms (physiologic or anatomic changes) are still being understood. Neurochemical systems are also obscure.
- Anatomic and physiologic mechanisms of immediate registration (intact in Korsakoff) are not fully deciphered.
- Psychologic features to account for include the importance of cueing and the imprecision of past memories, leading to unwitting embellishment and false recollection/fabrication. This has implications for memories of past abuse.

### Classification of Amnesic States (Table 20-5)

- **I. Amnesic syndrome of sudden onset—usually with gradual but incomplete recovery:**
    - Bilateral or left (dominant) hippocampal infarction
    - Bilateral or left (dominant) infarction of anteromedial thalamic nuclei
    - Infarction of the basal forebrain
    - Subarachnoid hemorrhage
    - Trauma to diencephalic, inferomedial temporal, or orbitofrontal regions
    - Cardiac arrest, carbon monoxide poisoning, and other hypoxic states
    - Following prolonged status epilepticus or delirium tremens
- **II. Amnesia of sudden onset and short duration:**
    - Temporal lobe seizures
    - Postconcussive states
    - Transient global amnesia
    - Hysteria
- **III. Amnesic syndrome of subacute onset with varying degrees of recovery, usually leaving permanent residua:**
    - Alcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
    - Herpes simplex encephalitis
    - Tuberculous and other forms of meningitis
- **IV. Slowly progressive amnesic states:**
    - Tumors involving the third ventricle and limbic cortical structures
    - Alzheimer disease (early stage) and other degenerative disorders with disproportionate affection of the temporal lobes
    - Paraneoplastic and other immune-mediated “limbic” encephalitis

### Transient Global Amnesia (TGA)

- A transient disturbance of memory observed in middle-aged and elderly persons, characterized by an episode of amnesia and bewilderment lasting several hours.
- Based on amnesia for recent past events coupled with ongoing anterograde amnesia.
- During the attack, consciousness, perception, seizure activity, personal identification, motor, sensory, and reflex functions are intact.
- The patient's behavior is normal except for incessant, repetitive questioning about immediate circumstances, often repeating the identical question.
- Unlike psychomotor epilepsy, the patient is alert, in contact with surroundings, and capable of high-level intellectual activity and language function during the attack.
- After the episode, mental function is normal except for a permanent memory gap for most of the attack period and a brief preceding period (hours or days). A mild headache may remain.
- Typical episodes are longer than 1 hour, rarely longer than 24 hours. It can be mistaken for a psychiatric episode.
- Psychologic deficit during TGA, except for its transience, is similar to a permanent amnesia syndrome.
    - Personality, high-level cognition, semantic language, and visuospatial discrimination are preserved.
    - Immediate memory (registration) operates normally, but memory is essentially obliterated.
- Retrograde amnesia duration is variable, shrinking after the attack to leave a permanent gap of about 1 hour. Subtle new learning impairment can persist for up to a week.
- Occurs at an annual rate of 5.2 cases per 100,000 population.
- Recurrence is not uncommon (noted in 66 of 277 older adults and 16 of 74 patients), but the mean annual recurrence rate is low (4.7%), suggesting most experience only one attack. One patient had over 50 attacks, but maximum 5 among most others.
- Children are generally not susceptible.
- No consistent antecedent events identified, but triggers reported include highly emotional experiences, pain, cold water exposure, sexual activity, and mild head trauma. Similarity to postconcussive amnesia is notable.
- Attacks can appear after minor diagnostic procedures (e.g., colonoscopy), where sedation effects are suspected. Cases in high-altitude climbers exist.
- Main concern in differential diagnosis is a temporal lobe seizure. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) involving the same regions, and rarely stroke, are also considered. Most cases are idiopathic after extensive evaluation.
- Pathogenesis of idiopathic TGA is undetermined.
- It has been suggested as an unusual form of temporal lobe epilepsy (TEA), but this is an unlikely unifying hypothesis. EEGs during or after attacks typically show no seizure activity. Amnesic episodes caused by seizures are usually briefer and associated with impaired consciousness.
- Functional MRI identified reduced activity in structures involved in episodic memory retrieval during TGA, which was bilateral, waned, and reversible.
- TGA may be ischemic or migrainous in nature, though rarely progressing to stroke.
- Similar memory deficits exist with ischemia in posterior cerebral artery territory (medial temporal lobe, thalamus), but lack TGA characteristics.
- Some studies suggest venous congestion of the temporal lobes (retrograde blood flow in internal jugular veins, lack of venous valves) as operative.
- Evidence for an ischemic basis includes bitemporal hypoperfusion during an attack (SPECT) and punctate foci of restricted diffusion in the hippocampus/perihypocampal structures on diffusion-weighted MRI (2 days post-attack, reversible).
- A hypothesis suggests a mismatch between cerebral blood supply and demand in limbic regions.
- Precipitation by highly emotional events, vertebrobasilar, and coronary angiography is suggestive.

# Approach to the Patient with Dementia and the Amnesic State

- The physician must adopt an examination technique designed to fully expose the intellectual defect.
- Abnormalities of posture, movement, sensation, and reflexes cannot be relied upon for diagnosis.
- Suspicion arises when: patients present multiple unrelated complaints, vaguely described irritability/nervousness/anxiety that don't fit psychiatric syndromes, or are incoherent in describing illness/reason for consult.
- Three categories of data are useful for recognition and differential diagnosis:
    1. experiences, personal habits/hygiene, memory, and judgment.
- Mental status examination should include general categories with examples, considering the patient's circumstances.
- The mode of answering and solving problems provides invaluable information.
- Many practitioners favor **Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)** or **Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)**for their speed and quantified serial measurement.
- A perplexed or slowed individual may perform adequately but still have flawed cortical/subcortical function.
- The patient must have normal or near-normal attentiveness to perform these tasks, as deficiency in one can disrupt others.
- **Mental Status Examination Categories and Examples:**
    1. **Immediate recall (attention, short-term working memory):**
        - Repeat digit series (3-8 digits).
        - Repeat digit series in reverse order.
        - Cross out all 'a's on a printed page.
        - Count forward and backward.
        - Say months of the year forward and backward.
        - Spell "world" forward and backward.
        - Verbal trail making (e.g., A-1, B-2).
    2. **Insight:** Patient's replies to questions about chief symptoms (e.g., "What is your difficulty?", "Are you ill?").
    3. **Orientation (knowledge of personal identity and present situation):**
        - Personal: Name, address, phone number, occupation, marital status.
        - Place: Building, city, state name; how they arrived; floor; bathroom location.
        - Time: Date (day, month, year); time of day; meals had; last holiday.
    4. **Memory:**
        - **Long term:** Names/birth dates of children/grandchildren, marriage date, mother's maiden name, first schoolteacher, jobs held (corroborated by family). Quiz on cultural icons and recent presidents in reverse order.
        - **Recent past:** Recent illness details (compare with previous statements), examiner's/nurse's name, first visit date, tests done yesterday, today's headlines.
        - **Memorization (learning):** Give simple data (e.g., "red ball, Beacon street, envelope"), ask to repeat after a minute. Recount main facts of a brief story. Test capacity to reproduce data at intervals; note recognition from multiple choices if spontaneous recall fails.
        - **Verbal fluency:** Generate list of objects in a category (animals, vegetables, car makes) in ~30 seconds (most list >12 items).
        - **Visual facility:** Show picture of objects, ask patient to name them.
    5. **Capacity for calculation, construction, and abstraction:**
        - **Calculation:** Add, subtract, multiply, divide. Serial 3s and 7s from 100 tests calculation and concentration. Consider education level.
        - **Constructions:** Draw a clock (hands at 7:45), US map, house floor plan; copy cube/other figures.
        - **Abstract thinking:** Describe similarities/differences between objects (e.g., orange/apple); explain proverbs/fables.
    6. **General behavior:** Attitudes, bearing, evidence of hallucinosis, coherent thought, attentiveness, mood, manner of dress.
    7. **Special tests of localized cerebral functions:** Grasping, sucking, aphasia battery, praxis with both hands, corticosensory function.
- Prepare the patient for these questions to gain cooperation, explaining they are not intelligence or sanity tests.
- If the patient is agitated/suspicious/belligerent, intellectual functions must be inferred from remarks and family information.
- This mental status survey takes about 10 minutes. High performance on all tests generally rules out dementia and aligns with formal tests like MMSE/MoCA. It may fail to identify dementia in uncooperative or highly intelligent patients in early stages.
- **Formal neuropsychologic tests** yield quantitative data but may be less valuable for diagnosis.
    - **MMSE:** Score >24/30 is normal; <21 indicates cognitive impairment. Normative scores vary by age/education.
    - **MoCA:** Validated for adults 55-85, max score 30. Can be adapted for physical disability. MCI patients usually score 19-25; confirmed Alzheimer disease patients <22.
- Other older tests (Roth, Pfeiffer, Blessed, Mattis) rely on similar assessments and daily living activities.
- For serial measurement in Alzheimer disease, the **Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog)** is more comprehensive and longer to administer.
- The **Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)** is probably accurate for detecting dementia; it uses discrepancy between stable measures (vocabulary) and sensitive measures (arithmetic, block design) to index deterioration.
- The **Wechsler Memory Scale** estimates memory failure and can distinguish amnesic states from general dementia (discrepancy >25 points with WAIS).
- Questions measuring spatial/temporal orientation and memory are key in most abbreviated scales.
- WAIS, MoCA, and MMSE are most widely used clinically.

### Nonorganic Memory Loss

- Can present as conversion/functional neurological disorder or feigned (malingering/factitious disorder).
- Has anterograde and retrograde amnesia components.
- Differs from organic amnesia in that it generally relates only to particular, often emotional, memories, with a sharply bounded scope.
- A claim of personal identity loss is not typical of organic memory loss, except in very advanced neurodegenerative dementias.
- Psychopathic malingerers typically lack the dissociative amnesia linked to emotional/stressful experiences.
- Detection and differentiation from organic amnesia is challenging, with important implications for treatment, relationships, and legal matters.
- Psychologists use assessment tools with embedded validity indicators (e.g., for over-endorsement of symptoms, underperformance on cognitive tasks). WAIS contains sub-scales to identify suboptimal effort.

# Management of the Demented Patient

- Dementia is a very serious clinical state.
- The physician may see the patient serially over weeks while appropriate laboratory and imaging tests are conducted.
- Hospital management can be simple if the patient is quiet and cooperative.
- If mental dysfunction is severe, a nurse, attendant, or family member should stay with the patient.
- The **primary responsibility is to diagnose treatable forms of dementia and institute appropriate therapy**.
- If an untreatable dementing brain disease is confirmed, a responsible family member should be informed of the medical facts and prognosis, and assisted with social and support services.
- Physicians now respond directly to patient queries about Alzheimer disease, typically stating they "may" have it but more time is needed to be certain.
- Intelligent patients who insist on knowing details should be given useful information.
- Reassurance of ongoing physician support is of utmost value.
- Regular contact with a general physician can preempt crises.
- If dementia is slight and circumstances suitable, patients should continue accustomed activities they are capable of.
- They should be spared responsibility and guarded against injury (e.g., leaving a stove on, getting lost while driving).
- If still working, plans for occupational retirement should be carried out.
- In more advanced stages, a skilled nursing facility or supervised home care should be arranged if possible.
- In advanced stages, feeding tubes are probably not a wise choice; hospice and palliative care may be beneficial.
- Centrally acting cholinergic agents and glutamate antagonists for Alzheimer disease have modest but clear value. Their use should be weighed against blood testing and side effects. They may offer psychological benefit if they don't worsen behavior or increase hallucinations, but are not appropriate for advanced stages.
- Undesirable restlessness, nocturnal wandering, belligerency, and psychosis are common in advanced neurodegenerative dementias.
- Experts recommend behavioral approaches: calming environmental changes, reassurance, frequent reorientation, and presence of family/staff.
- If these measures fail, judicious low doses of medications may be needed.
- Psychosis may be reduced by antipsychotic or benzodiazepine drugs, though these carry risks and can paradoxically worsen psychosis.
- Atypical antipsychotic drugs have shown no benefit in randomized trials and are associated with increased mortality.
- Haloperidol and new-generation antipsychotics are sometimes used as desperate efforts.
- **Pimavanserin**, an atypical antipsychotic, modestly improved Parkinson disease-associated psychosis in a randomized trial without causing sedation or motor impairment. It has higher receptor selectivity than other medications used. A discontinuation trial showed reduced psychosis in responders with various dementias.
- Short-acting sedatives like lorazepam may help some patients without worsening their mental condition, but all drugs must be given with caution, especially in parkinsonism-dementia syndromes.
- Valproate is not effective for agitation in dementia and is associated with higher adverse effects.
- Physicians must patiently and sensitively answer family questions. Common advice:
    - Do not correct or argue with the patient.
    - Orientation (date, circumstances, appointments) is helpful for daily activities.
    - Whether the patient can be left alone depends on circumstances and severity.
    - Patients should generally not manage their own money.
    - Changing environment or trips generally do not help and can worsen behavior/orientation.
    - Advise against driving in most instances.
    - Medication under supervision may help with fears at night and hallucinations.
    - The condition usually has a 5- to 10-year course.
- The Alzheimer Association website (Alz.org) is helpful, but physician guidance is needed.
- Visiting nurses, social agencies, live-in healthcare aides, day care settings, and respite care should be utilized to alleviate family burden.
- Legal vehicles like powers of attorney or guardianship can ameliorate practical problems caused by dementia.

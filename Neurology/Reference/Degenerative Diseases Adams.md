Here are concise notes from the provided chapter on degenerative diseases of the nervous system:

# Degenerative Diseases of the Nervous System

- The term "degenerative" implies an **inexplicable decline** from a previous level of normalcy to a lower level of function.
- Characterized by a pattern of **progressive neuronal loss** in functionally related cells, such as those of the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex; most are "system disorders".
- Clinically identified by a more or less **smoothly progressive loss of neurologic function** (e.g., parkinsonian features, ataxia, dementia).
- Many are characterized by the **accumulation of abnormal deposition of proteins**.
- Examples of implicated proteins include amyloid, tau, and synuclein.
- "Degeneration" pathologically refers to neuronal, myelin, or tissue breakdown, evoking phagocytosis and astrogliosis, but usually with **minimal or no inflammation**.
- Gowers (1902) suggested "abiotrophy" (lack of "vital endurance" of affected neurons).
- Many diseases in this category depend on **genetic factors**, including germ line genetic changes, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and copy number variations.
- The concept of **toxic protein deposition** (amyloid, tau, synuclein) is central, particularly in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
- There's a fundamental problem in distinguishing **aging deteriorations from degenerative diseases**; most manifest in later life, suggesting entanglement with aging.
- Degenerative diseases have **distinctive cellular and subcellular features** different from uncomplicated, programmed cell loss due to aging.
- Investigating inherited forms has revealed general principles common to both hereditary and sporadic forms of these disorders.
- Current classification based on genetic and molecular abnormalities (e.g., "tauopathies," "synucleinopathies") is an intermediate method, as precise subcellular mechanisms are still being determined.
- A more **clinical approach** based on constellations of clinical features related to degeneration of specific neural systems is endorsed.

# General Clinical Characteristics of Degenerative Diseases

- Diseases in this category begin **insidiously**, after a long period of normal nervous system function, and pursue a **gradually progressive course**.
- It is frequently impossible to assign a date of onset.
- Symptomatic expressions are **late events** in the pathologic process, occurring only when neuronal loss exceeds functional ability.
- **Irreversibility and steady progression** of clinical manifestations over months or years is a common feature.
- Familial occurrence is of great importance both clinically and scientifically, but information is often difficult to obtain.
- Many symptoms, while not curable, can be **alleviated by skillful management**.

# General Pathologic Features

- Most degenerative diseases are characterized by the **selective involvement of anatomically and physiologically related systems of neurons**.
    - Examples include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affecting motor neurons, and progressive ataxias affecting Purkinje cells.
    - These were historically called "system atrophies".
- Selective vulnerability is not exclusive to degenerative diseases; other processes like toxins can also have circumscribed effects.
- As the disease progresses, pathologic changes can become less selective and diffuse, but still tend to involve special categories of neurons early on.
- Pathologic process involves **slow wasting and loss of neurons**, dendrites, axons, and myelin sheaths, **unaccompanied by intense tissue reaction or cellular response**.
- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows little, if any, change**, or at most, a slight increase in protein content.
- Imaging typically shows **no change or only a volumetric reduction (atrophy)** with passive enlargement of CSF compartments, distinguishing these from tumors, infections, or inflammatory processes.
- Cell death mechanisms include **apoptosis**, though neuronal degeneration in these diseases refers to a protracted process in mature neurons, often leaving a glial scar but not regional tissue necrosis.
- Mechanisms other than programmed cell death, such as interference with synaptic signaling and dysfunction of supporting glial cells, are increasingly apparent.
- A current theme is the **aggregation within specific neurons of normal cellular proteins** like amyloid, tau, synuclein, ubiquitin, and huntingtin.
    - This can result from protein overproduction (e.g., gene triplication) or failure of normal protein removal.
- Diseases are sometimes grouped by protein aggregate type (e.g., tauopathy, synucleinopathy), though it's often unknown if the protein is the cause or result of cellular damage.
- Another characteristic is the possible **contiguous "spread" of protein aggregation** from one region to another via synaptic connections, affecting functionally integrated circuits sequentially.
- The physicochemical properties of aggregated proteins and their interference with cellular function are major research areas.

# CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION

- Grouping degenerative diseases by etiology is difficult, except for hereditary factors.
- A practical classification based on **presenting clinical syndromes and pathologic anatomy** is used for diagnosis and study.
- The main clinical categories are:
    - **I. Syndrome of progressive dementia, other neurologic signs absent or inconspicuous**
        - Alzheimer disease
        - Some cases of Lewy body disease
        - Frontotemporal dementias (Pick disease, behavioral variant, primary progressive aphasias (PPA))
        - Posterior cortical atrophy (visuospatial dementia)
    - **II. Syndrome of progressive dementia in combination with other neurologic abnormalities**
        - Huntington disease (chorea)
        - Lewy-body disease (parkinsonian features)
        - Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (rigidity, dystonia)
        - Cortical-striatal-spinal degeneration (spasticity)
        - Frontotemporal dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex
        - Familial dementia with spastic paraparesis, amyotrophy, or myoclonus
        - Polyglucosan body disease (neuropathy)
    - **III. Syndrome of disordered posture and movement**

        - Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration
        - Lewy-body disease
        - Restricted dystonias (spasmodic torticollis, Meige syndrome)
    - **IV. Syndrome of progressive ataxia**
        - Spinocerebellar ataxias (Friedreich ataxia, Non-Friedreich ataxia)
        - Cerebellar cortical ataxias (Holmes type, Late-onset)
        - Complicated hereditary and sporadic cerebellar ataxias (e.g., Multiple system atrophies (MSA-C), Dentatorubral degeneration, Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Machado-Joseph disease)
    - **V. Syndrome of slowly developing muscular weakness and atrophy**
        - Motor disorders with amyotrophy (e.g., Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Progressive spinal muscular atrophy, Progressive bulbar palsy, Kennedy syndrome, Motor neuron disease with frontotemporal dementia)
        - Spastic paraplegia without amyotrophy (e.g., Primary lateral sclerosis, Hereditary spastic paraplegia)
    - **VI. Sensory and sensorimotor disorders (neuropathies)**
        - Hereditary sensorimotor neuropathies (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth, Dejerine-Sottas)
        - Pure or predominantly sensory or motor neuropathic
        - Riley-Day autonomic degeneration
    - **VII. Syndrome of progressive blindness with or without other neurologic disorders**
        - Pigmentary degeneration of retina (retinitis pigmentosa)
        - Stargardt disease
        - Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD)
    - **VIII. Syndromes characterized by degenerative neurosensory deafness**
        - Pure neurosensory deafness
        - Hereditary hearing loss with retinal diseases
        - Hereditary hearing loss with system atrophies of the nervous system

# DISEASES CHARACTERIZED MAINLY BY PROGRESSIVE DEMENTIA

## Alzheimer Disease

- **Most common and important degenerative disease of the brain**.
- Alois Alzheimer described **neurofibrillary tangles** in 1907.
- Characterized by **diffuse cerebral atrophy**, with accelerated atrophy of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes in early stages.
- Formerly, Alzheimer disease and senile dementia were separate, but now they are considered clinically and pathologically indistinguishable except for age of onset.
- **Epidemiology**: Most patients are in their sixties or older; incidence increases significantly with age. Prevalence is approximately three times higher in women. Life expectancy is reduced to half.
- **Risk Factors**: Depression and possibly head injuries may increase risk. The role of low educational attainment vs. cognitive reserve is debated.
- **Genetics**:
    - **~1% of cases have a dominant inheritance pattern** with early onset and high penetrance.
    - Familial clustering without obvious genetic markers is common.
    - Gene coding for APP (amyloid precursor protein) is on **chromosome 21**, explaining Alzheimer changes in Down syndrome (trisomy 21) due to amyloid overproduction.
    - Rare dominant mutations in **presenilin 1 (chromosome 14)** and **presenilin 2 (chromosome 1)** genes (catalytic components of gamma-secretase) are found in familial forms, increasing Aβ42 levels.
    - The **ApoE E4 allele (chromosome 19) is a major genetic risk factor** for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, tripling the risk and accelerating onset.
    - TREM2 polymorphism and UBQLN1 mutations are other rare modifying genes.
    - The Christchurch variant of APOE can delay disease onset.
- **Clinical Features**:
    - Onset is usually **insidious**, often recognized months or years later.
    - **Gradual development of forgetfulness** is the major symptom, particularly for day-to-day happenings and names. Remote memories are also affected.
    - Progressive failures in **language** (halting speech, anomic aphasia, reduced comprehension), **arithmetic**(acalculia), and **visuospatial orientation**.
    - Late in the illness, patients forget how to use common objects (**apraxia**).
    - Behavioral changes include restlessness, agitation, apathy, disinhibition, paranoia, and sleep disturbances.
    - Difficulty in locomotion and elements of parkinsonism may supervene in advanced stages.
    - The symptomatic course usually extends over **5 or more years**, but the pathologic course has a much longer asymptomatic duration (preclinical stage).
    - Corticospinal and corticosensory functions, visual acuity, and ocular movements generally remain intact.
    - Five limited deficits may be early features, qualifying as **mild cognitive impairment (MCI)**: amnesia, dysnomia, visuospatial disorientation, paranoia/personality changes, and executive dysfunction.
    - The diagnosis is primarily clinical, aided by imaging and neuropsychological testing.
- **Pathology**:
    - Microscopically, there is **widespread loss of nerve cells**, especially in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and medial temporal cortex.
    - Three additional distinctive microscopic changes:
        1. **Alzheimer neurofibrillary changes ("tangles")**: intracellular thick, fiber-like strands composed of **hyperphosphorylated tau protein**. These correlate best with dementia severity.
        2. **Neuritic plaques**: spherical deposits of amorphous material, with a core of **amyloid protein**, surrounded by degenerating nerve terminals. Amyloid also appears as "diffuse" forms and in blood vessel walls (congophilic angiopathy).
        3. **Granulovacuolar degeneration of neurons**.
- **Pathogenesis**:
    - The **Aβ (beta-amyloid) protein** is cleaved from a larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cleavage by β- and γ-secretase results in toxic Aβ42, which aggregates.
    - The "amyloid hypothesis" posits that elevated Aβ42 levels lead to amyloid aggregation and neuronal toxicity.
    - Genetic defects in APP and presenilin genes support the amyloid hypothesis.
    - However, uncertainty remains about the direct link between amyloid deposition and neuronal loss; soluble Aβ oligomers might be toxic.
    - Tau deposition (tangles) correlates more closely with cognitive ability and cortical atrophy than amyloid plaques.
    - Cerebral infarctions and ischemic white matter disease can accelerate amyloid deposition and tangle formation, exaggerating dementia.
    - **Neurotransmitter abnormalities**: marked reduction in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholine in the hippocampus and neocortex. This is attributed to loss of cells in the nucleus basalis of Meynert.
- **Diagnostic Studies**:
    - CT and MRI are useful primarily for **excluding alternative causes** of dementia.
    - **PET scans with amyloid and tau-ligands** are more sensitive for identifying and observing the course of the disease, especially in early stages.
    - **Neuropsychologic tests** show disproportionate deterioration in memory and verbal access skills.
    - The **ratio of tau to Aβ42 in the CSF** is a biological marker (low in Alzheimer's).
- **Treatment**:
    - No current treatment halts or reverses neuronal degeneration.
    - **Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil)** offer mild and unsustained therapeutic effects, slightly prolonging independent life. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, insomnia, and confusion.
    - **Memantine (an NMDA glutaminergic antagonist)** is approved for late-stage disease, showing better results in functional behavior, but little change in cognitive performance.
    - Trials of small molecule inhibitors and most monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid have failed to demonstrate benefit. Lecanemab, an antibody against fibrillary forms of amyloid, has shown modest success in slowing early disease.
    - General management and supportive care for the patient and family are exceedingly important.

## Lobar Atrophies (Frontotemporal Degeneration [FTD], Primary Progressive Aphasia, Posterior Cortical Atrophy)

- A broad category where selective atrophy of a cerebral lobe may be caused by various histopathologic changes.
- **Pick (1892)** described a circumscribed cerebral degeneration, often in frontal or temporal lobes, affecting both gray and white matter.
- Pathologic changes can include Pick inclusion bodies, neurofibrillary tangles, other inclusions, or just neuronal loss.
- In contrast to Alzheimer's, lobar atrophy is **circumscribed and often asymmetrical**, with marked narrowing of the cortical ribbon and reduced volume of underlying white matter.
- The more common **Frontotemporal Degenerations (FTDs)** often have **tau deposition** as the underlying pathology, but also progranulin, amyloid, or synuclein.
- **Clinical and Pathologic Features**:
    - FTD presents as a clinical syndrome with two main types: a **behavioral variant** and a **language (aphasic) variant**.
    - **Behavioral variant FTD**: presents with progressive personality abnormalities, apathy, disinhibition, poor judgment, loss of empathy, bizarre affect, eating disorders, impaired insight, and compulsive behaviors. Imaging shows disproportionate/asymmetric frontal lobe atrophy and hypofunction. Some patients have parkinsonian features or a linked form of motor neuron disease.
    - **Primary progressive aphasias (PPA)**: focal disturbances, especially aphasia and apraxia, are early and prominent. Types include:
        1. **Progressive nonfluent aphasia**: initial word-finding difficulty, later impaired comprehension, short sentences, and eventual mutism.
        2. **Semantic dementia**: early difficulty naming items, people, and words, with verbal perseveration but retained fluency; eventually loss of meaning or conceptual knowledge.
        3. **Logopenic aphasia**: shares aspects of nonfluent aphasia but word meaning is retained.
    - **Posterior cortical atrophy**: characterized by progressive loss of ability to interpret and use visual information, leading to severe visuospatial difficulty with relatively preserved memory. Symptoms include prosopagnosia, achromatopsia, dyslexia, and elements of Balint and Gerstmann syndromes. The most common pathologic change is characteristic of Alzheimer disease.

## Lewy Body Dementia (Diffuse Lewy Body Disease, DLB)

- Second most frequent pathologic diagnosis in demented patients, after Alzheimer's.
- Defined by **diffuse involvement of cortical neurons with Lewy body inclusions** and absence or inconspicuous neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques.
- **Aggregated α-synuclein is the main component of the Lewy body**.
- **Clinical Features**:
    - Typical form is marked by **parkinsonian features, dementia, and a tendency to episodic delirium**(especially nocturnally) and **rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder**.
    - Diagnostic criteria require 2 of 3: parkinsonian syndrome (usually symmetric), fluctuations in behavior and cognition, and recurrent hallucinations.
    - **Episodic confusion, hallucinations, and paranoid delusions** are highly characteristic and distinguish it from Alzheimer's and lobar dementias.
    - Parkinsonian features can respond to L-dopa, but sometimes cause agitated delirium or hallucinations.
    - Often presents with **orthostatic hypotension** due to cell loss and Lewy bodies in sympathetic ganglia, simulating multiple system atrophy-P (MSA-P).
    - Patients show an **extreme sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs**.
- **Diagnostic Testing**:
    - SPECT scans and PET with radiolabeled dopamine ligands show **reduced striatal activity**, similar to Parkinson's disease, distinguishing it from Alzheimer's.
    - Detection of **phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in skin nerves** can distinguish Lewy body dementia from other dementias.
    - Cardiac imaging (I-123 MIBG) is often abnormal due to loss of sympathetic innervation.
- **Treatment**:
    - **Support of the family is paramount**.
    - The anticholinesterase inhibitor **rivastigmine** has been shown to reduce delusions, hallucinations, and anxiety.
    - Pimavanserin has shown modest benefit for psychosis and hallucinations without worsening motor symptoms.
    - Antipsychotic drugs (quetiapine, clozapine) are used but limited by risks and parkinsonian side effects.

## Other Degenerative Dementias

### Argyrophilic Grain Disease

- Connected with a late-life dementia where behavioral disturbances precede memory difficulty.
- Characterized by argyrophilic grains in the medial temporal lobe.

### Neuroserpinopathy

- Rare, dominantly inherited, adult-onset dementia with fulminant evolution and seizures.
- Distinctive feature: large eosinophilic, PAS-positive intraneuronal inclusions containing aggregates of **neuroserpin**.

# DEMENTING DISEASES WITH OTHER PROMINENT NEUROLOGIC FEATURES

## Huntington Disease (Huntington Chorea)

- Characterized by a triad of **dominant inheritance, choreoathetosis, and dementia**.
- All US patients can be traced to about six individuals who emigrated from England in 1630.
- An autosomal dominant gene with **complete penetrance**.
- Discovery of the **huntingtin gene (HTT)** on chromosome 4.
- The mutation is an **excessively long repeat of the trinucleotide CAG** within the gene. The length of the repeat determines the presence and age of onset (longer repeats = earlier onset).
    - Normal: 11-34 repeats; >42 repeats almost invariably cause disease.
    - Earlier onset in successive generations (**anticipation**) is due to increasing CAG repeat lengths.
- **Clinical Features**:
    - Subtle **alterations of personality** (e.g., suspiciousness, irritability, poor self-control) are often the first symptoms.
    - **Depression is common** and may be prominent early. Psychosis with delusions or hallucinations can occur.
    - Intellectual function gradually fails globally, but **memory is relatively spared** (characterized as "subcortical dementia").
    - Movement abnormality begins subtly in hands and face (fidgety, restless), gradually progressing to **generalized chorea**.
    - Rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia may appear late; the "rigid" or **Westphal variant** is more common in childhood onset.
    - Oculomotor function is subtly affected, with impaired initiation and slowness of saccadic movements.
    - The relation of chorea to mental symptoms varies; mental symptoms often precede chorea.
    - The disease progresses relentlessly, typically leading to a vegetative state after 10-15 years; death occurs, on average, 15-20 years after onset.
    - **High suicide rate**.
    - Childhood onset often includes cerebellar ataxia, behavior problems, seizures, bradykinesia, and dystonia rather than chorea.
- **Pathology**:
    - Characteristic abnormality is **gross atrophy bilaterally of the head of the caudate nucleus and putamen**.
    - PET studies show a **decrease in glucose metabolism in the caudate nuclei** that precedes volumetric tissue loss.
    - The mutant huntingtin protein aggregates in the nuclei of neurons, preferentially accumulating in striatal and affected cortical cells.
- **Diagnosis**:
    - Confirmed by **DNA analysis from a blood sample** to measure CAG repeat length.
    - Differential diagnosis includes other causes of chorea, such as "senile chorea" (which has many causes), Sydenham chorea, lupus erythematosus, and tardive dyskinesia.
- **Treatment**:
    - **Haloperidol** can partially suppress the movement disorder but does not alter disease progression.
    - Drugs that deplete dopamine or block dopamine receptors (e.g., **deutetrabenazine**) can suppress chorea but have side effects.
    - Antidepressant drugs are widely used due to high incidence of depression and suicidality.
    - **Antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., tominersen)** are being tested to reduce huntingtin mRNA and protein in the CNS.

## Familial Dementia With Spastic Paraparesis

- Involves several family members developing **spastic paraparesis** and a **gradual failure of intellectual function** in middle adult years.
- Examination shows exaggerated tendon reflexes, clonus, and Babinski signs.
- Some types are associated with more widespread nervous system involvement, including cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy.
- Can be associated with progressive cerebellar ataxia, deafness, dizziness, chorea, and seizures.

## Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease

- A progressive neurologic disease characterized clinically by **spasticity, chorea, dementia, and a predominantly sensory polyneuropathy**.
- **Polyglucosan bodies** (glucose polymers) are found in large numbers in central and peripheral neural processes (mainly axons) and astrocytes. These can be demonstrated in sural nerve biopsies.
- The dementia is relatively mild, consisting of impairment of retentive memory, dysnomia, and dyscalculia.
- Bladder dysfunction is often an early sign.
- MRI may show generalized cerebral atrophy, multifocal white matter rarefaction, and degeneration of the corticospinal system.

# DISEASES CHARACTERIZED BY ABNORMALITIES OF POSTURE AND MOVEMENT

## Parkinson Disease

- First cogently described by James Parkinson in 1817.
- **Clinical Features**:
    - The core features are a **tetrad of hypo- and bradykinesia, resting tremor, postural instability, and rigidity**.
    - Presents as an expressionless face, poverty and slowness of voluntary movement, "resting" tremor, stooped posture, axial instability, rigidity, and festinating gait.
    - Initial symptoms often include tremor (70%), gait disturbance (11%), and stiffness (10%).
    - Infrequent blinking and a "masked" facial appearance (hypomimia) are early signs.
    - The characteristic **"pill-rolling" tremor** (approximately 4 per second) is typically present when the hand is motionless, affecting about half of patients. It is often asymmetrical.
    - A second common tremor is a fine, 7- to 8-per-second, irregular **action tremor** of outstretched fingers.
    - **Rigidity** of the extrapyramidal type is constantly present and may be interrupted by the "cog-wheel phenomenon".
    - **Bradykinesia** (slowness of movement) and **hypokinesia** (lack of natural movements) are independent manifestations, leading to poverty of movement.
    - Handwriting becomes small (micrographia). Speech softens, becomes monotonous, and mumbling (hypokinetic dysarthria).
    - Walking is reduced to a shuffle, with a tendency to fall forward ("festination"). "Freezing" in place can occur at obstacles.
    - Dystonia, including persistent extension or clawing of toes and jaw clenching, can be present. **Camptocormia** (extreme forward flexion of the spine) occurs in some.
    - Patients may retain capability for brief, remarkably effective movement in unusual circumstances (**kinesis paradoxica**).
    - An inability to inhibit blinking in response to a tap over the nose (Myerson sign).
    - Impairment of upward gaze and convergence may suggest Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP).
    - No sensory findings, but paresthetic and other sensory complaints are common.
    - **Orthostatic hypotension** and REM sleep behavior disorder are observed but are less frequent than in Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) or Lewy body dementia.
    - Dementia complicates the disease in 10-15% of patients, increasing with age and disease duration.
    - The overall course is variable; mean time to a chairbound state is 7.5 years.
- **Pathology and Pathogenesis**:
    - The most constant finding is a **loss of pigmented cells in the substantia nigra** and other pigmented nuclei.
    - **Accumulation of α-synuclein in the substantia nigra** and other brainstem nuclei is considered the essential feature.
    - Many remaining pigmented cells contain eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions called **Lewy bodies**.
    - Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra is significantly more marked than age-related decline.
    - The **Braak and Tredici hypothesis** suggests that the substantia nigra compacta is affected late, with earliest changes in the dorsal glossopharyngeal-vagal and anterior olfactory nuclei.
    - Overlap with Alzheimer disease pathology is seen, with some demented Parkinson's patients showing Alzheimer-type changes or widespread Lewy bodies.
    - The neurotoxin **MPTP** produces parkinsonism and selective destruction of substantia nigra cells, serving as a model for the disease.
    - **α-synuclein instability or misfolding, or its deficient removal**, is considered a primary defect in both sporadic and inherited forms. Mutations in the α-synuclein gene can promote its aggregation.
- **Genetic Aspects**:
    - Familial occurrence may be as high as 15%, suggesting a substantial role for inherited traits even in sporadic cases.
    - Mutations in at least ten genes (e.g., SNCA, LRRK2, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1) are related to typical or "classical" forms. Only ~5% of patients have monogenic forms.
    - **Parkin** (a ubiquitin protein ligase) mutations lead to synuclein accumulation or disruption of protein disposal.
    - **LRRK2** mutations are implicated in both genetic and sporadic forms, especially among Ashkenazic Jewish or North African populations.
    - **Glucocerebrosidase gene mutations** are a common genetic factor, particularly in Ashkenazi Jews, and are associated with earlier onset.
- **Treatment**:
    - No current treatment clearly halts or reverses neuronal degeneration, but methods offer significant symptom relief.
    - **L-dopa (levodopa)** is the most effective agent, especially for hypokinesia and tremor. It is often combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa/benserazide) to reduce peripheral side effects.
    - **Dopamine agonists** (e.g., ropinirole, pramipexole) have direct dopaminergic effects and are favored for initial treatment or for modulating L-dopa effects later, as they are associated with fewer dyskinetic complications.
    - **COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone)** extend L-dopa's plasma half-life.
    - **Amantadine** has mild benefits for motor symptoms and can reduce L-dopa–induced dyskinesias.
    - **Anticholinergic agents** (e.g., trihexyphenidyl, benztropine) are useful for tremor, especially in younger patients.
    - **Side effects of dopaminergic treatments** can include nausea, orthostatic hypotension, involuntary dyskinetic movements ("on-off" phenomenon), confusion, hallucinations, and pathological behaviors like gambling.
    - **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)** is a surgical option where electrodes are implanted in the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus. It enhances L-dopa responsiveness and reduces drug-induced dyskinesias, improving quality of life.
    - Ancillary treatments include exercise, physical therapy (e.g., Tai Chi), speech therapy, and management of non-motor symptoms like orthostatic hypotension and dystonia.

## Multiple System Atrophy (Striatonigral Degeneration, Shy-Drager Syndrome, MSA)

- A group of disorders characterized by neuronal degeneration mainly in the **substantia nigra, striatum, autonomic nervous system, and cerebellum**.
- **Clinical Features**:
    - Either **parkinsonism (MSA-P)** or **cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C)** may predominate.
    - **MSA-A** refers to the combined parkinsonian and autonomic disorder, formerly known as Shy-Drager syndrome.
    - Common features of **autonomic failure** include **orthostatic hypotension**, erectile dysfunction, loss of sweating, dry mouth, miosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Vocal cord palsy is sometimes an initial manifestation.
    - MSA is distinguished from Parkinson's disease by **relative symmetry of signs, rapid course, lack of response to L-dopa, absence or minimal tremor, and early presence of autonomic disorders**.
- **Pathology**:
    - Extensive loss of neurons in the zona compacta of the substantia nigra, but **notably, no Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles**.
    - Degenerative changes in the putamina and, to a lesser extent, in the caudate.
    - The histopathologic hallmark is the presence of **glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs)** in astroglia and oligodendrocytes, composed of α-synuclein.

## Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)

- A clinicopathologic entity delineated in 1963. Most cases are sporadic.
- **Clinical Features**:
    - Onset typically in the **sixth decade**.
    - Initial complaints include **difficulty in balance, abrupt falls** (often backward), visual/ocular disturbances, slurred speech, and dysphagia.
    - Characteristic syndrome comprises **supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, pseudobulbar palsy, and axial dystonia**.
    - Key ocular sign: **difficulty in voluntary vertical eye movements** (especially downward), and later, impaired voluntary saccades in all directions, while reflex eye movements may be retained.
    - Presents with a **wide-eyed, unblinking stare** due to retracted upper eyelids. Blepharospasm is prominent in some.
    - Gait disturbance often involves frequent toppling and falls, with a tendency to lean backward (retropulsion).
    - Stiffening and extension of the neck (axial dystonia) are common.
    - The stiffness and slowness of movement may suggest Parkinson's, but the **lack of tremor, erect posture, and prominent oculomotor abnormalities** distinguish PSP.
    - **Pseudobulbar palsy** (slurred, spastic speech, difficult swallowing, pathologic laughing/crying) is eventually prominent.
    - Dementia is often present but typically mild.
- **Pathology**:
    - Postmortem examinations show bilateral loss of neurons and gliosis in the periaqueductal gray matter, superior colliculus, subthalamic nucleus, red nucleus, pallidum, and dentate nucleus.
    - The remarkable finding is **neurofibrillary degeneration** of many residual neurons, with thick, often single-stranded tau tangles.
- **Treatment**:
    - L-dopa has only **slight and unsustained benefit**.
    - Benztropine or trihexyphenidyl may help reduce dystonia, but botulinum injections are a better alternative for focal signs.

## Cortical-Basal Ganglionic Degeneration (CBGD)

- Characterized by **progressive asymmetrical extrapyramidal rigidity** combined with corticospinal disease signs and, sometimes, ideomotor apraxia.
- The parkinsonism is generally **unresponsive to L-dopa**.
- Early symptoms often include asymmetrical clumsiness of the limbs, rigidity, and tremor.
- Patients may exhibit the "alien hand" phenomenon (a limb drifts off or assumes an odd posture without awareness).
- Dementia can be an early feature in some, but more often appears late or not at all.
- **Pathology**:
    - Postmortem examination shows a combination of **cortical atrophy** (mainly frontal motor–premotor and anterior parietal lobes) and **degeneration of the substantia nigra**.
    - The disease is related to **tau deposition**. Neurons can show "neuronal achromasia" (ballooned and chromatolytic neurons with eccentric nuclei) that stain for tau.
    - Adjacent glia are filled with tau protein, linking CBGD to frontotemporal lobar degeneration and PSP.
- There are no known effective drugs.

## Corticostriatospinal Degenerations

- A heterogeneous group of degenerative diseases combining symptoms of parkinsonism and corticospinal degeneration.
- **Jakob's "Spastic Pseudosclerosis"** (1921) describes a chronic disease with abnormalities of behavior and intellect, weakness, ataxia, spasticity, and extrapyramidal symptoms.
- Some cases include prominent changes in anterior horn cells and corticospinal tracts, resembling ALS.
- The **Guamanian Parkinson-dementia-ALS complex** is an endemic disease characterized by progressive parkinsonism and dementia combined with upper or lower motor neuron disease. Pathologically, it shows severe cortical atrophy with **neurofibrillary tangles** and depopulation of the substantia nigra, but **no Lewy bodies or amyloid plaques**.

## Acanthocytosis With Chorea (Neuroacanthocytosis)

- A group of neurologic diseases associated with **red blood cell acanthocytosis** (thorny/spiky appearance of erythrocytes).
- The main syndrome is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation, linked to a gene encoding the protein **chorein**.
- **Clinical manifestations** include dystonia, tics, vocalizations, rigidity, lip and tongue biting, and in more than half of cases, cognitive impairment or psychiatric features.
- **Pathology** shows atrophy and gliosis of the caudate nuclei and putamens, but no neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex.
- **McLeod disease** is another X-linked disorder with acanthocytosis and gradual development of chorea, degeneration of the caudate and putamen, and a myopathy.

## Dystonic Disorders

- **Dystonia Musculorum Deformans (Torsion Dystonia)**:
    - Severe, progressive dystonia, often the sole manifestation.
    - Inherited forms exist: recessive (early childhood, Jewish patients) and dominant (later, slower progression, not ethnic-limited).
    - Most important genetic cause is an abnormal gene **DYT1 (TOR1A)**, coding for the protein torsin A, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
    - Characterized by **simultaneous contraction of agonists and antagonists** at a joint.
    - Excitement worsens dystonia, sleep abolishes it.
    - No specific pathologic substrate has been consistently identified by light microscopy.
    - Treatment approaches include high doses of anticholinergic drugs (e.g., trihexyphenidyl) and bilateral **deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus**.
- **Hereditary Dystonia-Parkinsonism (Segawa Syndrome, Juvenile Dopa-Responsive Dystonia, GCH1 Mutation)**:
    - Main characteristic is **dystonia responsive to L-dopa**; most cases also have parkinsonian features.
    - Dramatic response to L-dopa, which can be continued indefinitely without tolerance or dyskinesias.
    - Features a **marked diurnal fluctuation of symptoms** (disappear after sleep, worsen during the day).
    - Autosomal dominant inheritance, linked to the **GCH1 gene** on chromosome 14q, which is involved in dopamine synthesis.
- **Torticollis and Other Restricted Dyskinesias and Dystonias**:
    - Localized groups of adjacent muscles manifest arrhythmic cocontracting spasms.
    - **Torticollis** is the most frequent type, involving head turning to one side.
    - Other restricted dyskinesias involve facial muscles (blepharospasm), throat/respiratory muscles (spastic dysphonia), and hands (writer's cramp).

# SYNDROME OF PROGRESSIVE ATAXIA

- A group of chronic, progressive cerebellar diseases, mostly familial, which can involve other nervous system components.
- Classified into: **spinocerebellar ataxias** (spinal cord involvement), **pure cerebellar ataxias** (no other neurologic disorders), and **complicated cerebellar ataxias** (various associated pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and sensory features).
- Inherited ataxias of early onset (<20 years) are usually recessive; later onset are more likely dominant.

## Friedreich Ataxia (FXN Mutation)

- The **prototype of progressive spinocerebellar ataxias**, accounting for about half of all hereditary ataxias.
- Inheritance is **autosomal recessive**.
- The mutation is an **expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat within the FXN gene**, which codes for the protein frataxin. The length of the shorter expansion correlates with disease severity and onset.
- **Clinical Features**:
    - **Ataxia of gait** is nearly always the initial symptom, typically in childhood and adolescence.
    - Hands become clumsy later, followed by dysarthric speech.
    - **Pes cavus** (high plantar arch) and **kyphoscoliosis** are often evident.
    - The gait is of **mixed sensory and cerebellar type** ("tabetocerebellar"), with a positive **Romberg sign** (falling with eyes closed).
    - Arms are grossly ataxic with action and intention tremors. Speech is slow, slurred, explosive.
    - **Tendon reflexes are abolished in nearly every case**. Plantar reflexes are extensor.
    - **Loss of vibratory and position sense is invariable**.
    - A notable feature in more than half of patients is a **cardiomyopathy**, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmia or congestive heart failure.
    - Approximately 10% of patients have diabetes mellitus.
- **Variants** exist where tendon reflexes are preserved or hyperactive, and limbs may be spastic.
- **Pathology**:
    - The spinal cord is thin, with depletion of myelinated fibers in the posterior columns, corticospinal, and spinocerebellar tracts.
    - Loss of nerve cells in Clarke column, dorsal root ganglia, and some Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.
- **Treatment**: Little effective therapy. Idebenone (an antioxidant) has shown some benefit for cardiomyopathy in some trials. Histone deacetylase inhibitors and gene therapy are under investigation.

## Cerebellar Cortical Ataxias (Holmes Type)

- Ataxia is related to degenerative changes primarily in the **cerebellum and brainstem**, rather than the spinal cord.
- Later age of onset, usually autosomal dominant inheritance, and persistent or hyperactive tendon reflexes distinguish these from Friedreich ataxia.
- **Holmes (1907a)** described a form that spares the pontine nuclei, distinguishing it from MSA with cerebellar degeneration.
- **Clinical Features**: Insidious onset, usually in the fourth decade, slowly progressive. Presents with gait ataxia, trunk instability, hand/head tremor, and slightly slowed speech. Nystagmus is rare, and intelligence is usually preserved.

## Fragile X Tremor–Ataxic Premutation Syndrome (FMR1 Mutation, FXTAS)

- An unusual variant of a developmental delay syndrome, with onset in mid-to-late adulthood, mainly in men.
- Affects carriers of a "premutation" (50-200 CGG repeat sequences in the **FMR1 gene**).
- Consists of **gait or limb ataxia and mild tremor**.
- Can also include parkinsonian syndrome and mild frontal dementia.
- Neuropathologically, there are cerebral and cerebellar spongiform white matter changes and both intranuclear and astrocytic inclusions.

## Combined Cerebellar Degeneration with Brainstem and Extrapyramidal Features (Multiple System Atrophy; MSA-C)

- A sporadically occurring disorder resembling Holmes type cortical cerebellar degeneration but with additional **brainstem atrophy**.
- Often referred to as olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA).
- Distinguished from Holmes type by involvement of **pontocerebellar and olivocerebellar fibers**.
- Can involve autonomic features and REM-sleep behavior disorder.

## Machado-Joseph Azorean Disease (SCA3, ATXN3)

- A form of hereditary ataxia with brainstem and extrapyramidal signs, mainly of Portuguese-Azorean origin.
- **Autosomal dominant** pattern of inheritance.
- Characterized by slowly progressive ataxia beginning in adolescence or early adult life, associated with dysarthria, hyperreflexia, extrapyramidal rigidity, dystonia, and sometimes bulbar signs, distal motor weakness, polyneuropathy, or ophthalmoplegia.
- Early finding: **dysmetric horizontal and vertical saccades**.
- Genetic defect: unstable number of **CAG repeating sequences in ataxin-3**.
- No treatment of proven value.

## Dentatorubropallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA, ATN1)

- A rare familial disorder seen mostly in Japan and Europe.
- Symptoms of cerebellar ataxia coupled with choreoathetosis and dystonia, sometimes parkinsonism, myoclonus, epilepsy, or dementia.
- Pathologically, there is **degeneration of the dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems**.
- Gene defect is an **unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in ATN1** (codes for atrophin 1).
- Inherited as an **autosomal dominant trait** and shows an **inverse correlation between age of onset and gene expansion size (anticipation)**.

## Paroxysmal Ataxias

- Two adult forms:
    1. **EA-2 (episodic ataxia, type 2)**: episodes last several hours, prominent vertigo, normal or minimal ataxia/nystagmus between attacks. Caused by a mutation of the **calcium channel gene on chromosome 19**and is strikingly prevented by oral **acetazolamide**.
    2. **EA-1**: episodes precipitated by exercise, with muscle myokymia between attacks; no vertigo. Caused by an abnormality of the **potassium channel gene on chromosome 12**. Acetazolamide is less effective.
- Both are "channelopathies".

# SYNDROME OF MUSCULAR WEAKNESS AND WASTING WITHOUT SENSORY CHANGES

## Motor Neuron Disease

- General term for a group of progressive degenerative disorders of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor cortex.
- Manifest clinically by **muscular weakness, atrophy, and corticospinal tract signs**.
- **Subtypes**:
    - **ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)**: amyotrophy (denervation atrophy/weakness) and hyperreflexia.
    - **Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA)**: weakness and atrophy alone, without corticospinal tract dysfunction.
    - **Progressive bulbar palsy**: weakness and wasting in muscles innervated by lower brainstem motor nuclei (jaw, face, tongue, pharynx, larynx).
    - **Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)**: dominated by spastic weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski signs, with lower motor neuron aspects appearing later or not at all; involves only corticospinal pathways.
- Special spinal muscular atrophies in infancy and childhood (SMA types I, II, III) are genetically distinct and arise from SMN gene mutations.

### Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

- Delineated by Charcot (1869-1874).
- **Epidemiology**: Annual incidence 0.4-1.76 per 100,000; men affected nearly twice as often. Most patients are older than 45 at onset. ~5% of cases are familial (autosomal dominant).
- **Clinical Features**:
    - Typically begins with **weakness in a distal part of one limb** (e.g., foot drop, awkward fine finger movements).
    - Can include cramping and fasciculations.
    - The triad of **atrophic weakness of hands/forearms, fasciculations, slight spasticity of arms/legs, and generalized hyperreflexia—all in the absence of sensory change**—is characteristic.
    - Despite amyotrophy, **tendon reflexes are notably lively**.
    - Progresses inexorably; half of patients succumb within 3 years, 90% within 6 years.
    - Between 5% and 20% of ALS cases are observed in conjunction with **frontotemporal dementia**.
- **Laboratory Features**:
    - **EMG** displays widespread fibrillations and fasciculations, and enlarged motor units.
    - Motor nerve conduction studies show only slight slowing without focal motor conduction block.
    - **CSF protein is usually normal**. Serum creatine kinase (CK) can be moderately elevated.
    - MRI may show slight atrophy of motor cortices and Wallerian degeneration of motor tracts.
- **Pathology**:
    - Principal finding is **loss of nerve cells in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and motor nuclei of the lower brainstem**.
    - The anterior roots are thin, and large myelinated fibers in motor nerves are lost.
    - Many surviving nerve cells contain **ubiquitin inclusions**, often made up of **TDP-43**.
    - **Corticospinal tract degeneration** is evident throughout the spinal cord, brainstem, and internal capsule.
- **Pathogenesis and Genetics**:
    - Approximately 40% of familial cases are associated with a **hexanucleotide expansion in the C9orf72 gene**, also found in 5-10% of sporadic cases.
    - TARDBP and FUS genes are associated with familial and sporadic cases.
    - The **SOD1 mutation** was the first found in familial ALS.
- **Treatment**:
    - The antiglutamate agent **riluzole** has been shown to slow progression and improve survival by a few months.
    - **Tofersen**, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting SOD1, may slow clinical decline in SOD1-positive ALS.
    - Supportive measures are exceedingly important, including management of spasticity, physical and occupational therapy, and especially **respiratory management (e.g., BiPAP)** and **nutrition (feeding tube)**.

### Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA)

- A purely lower motor neuron syndrome, more common in men, generally progressing slower than ALS.
- Differs from ALS in that tendon reflexes are diminished or absent, and signs of corticospinal tract disease cannot be detected.

### Progressive Bulbar Palsy

- The first and dominant symptoms relate to weakness and laxity of muscles innervated by lower brainstem motor nuclei (jaw, face, tongue, pharynx, larynx).
- Leads to early defects in **articulation** and impaired **mastication and deglutition**.
- **Fasciculations and focal loss of tissue of the tongue are usually early manifestations**.
- The jaw jerk may be exaggerated, and pseudobulbar signs (pathologic laughing and crying) can be pronounced.
- **Ocular muscles always escape**.
- Inexorably progressive, leading to death from inanition and aspiration pneumonia, usually within 2-3 years of onset.

### Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS)

- A special form of motor neuron disease where the degenerative process remains confined to the **corticospinal pathways**, sparing anterior horn cells.
- Begins insidiously with stiffness in one leg, then the other, with spasticity predominating over weakness.
- A diagnostic criterion is progression for **3 years without evidence of lower motor neuron dysfunction**.
- Pathologic studies show reduced Betz cells in the motor cortex and degeneration of the corticospinal tracts, but preservation of spinal cord and brainstem motor neurons.

## Genetic Forms of Progressive Muscular Atrophy

- Have a clear heredofamilial, usually monogenic, nature.

### Spinal Muscular Atrophy (Werdnig-Hoffman Disease, SMN Mutation)

- The most frequent form is the severe infantile type (SMA 1), occurring once in every 20,000 live births.
- Infants are typically noted from birth to be **unnaturally weak and limp ("floppy baby")**.
- The weakness is generalized, with hypotonia, and **tendon reflexes are typically unobtainable**.
- Inherited mainly as an **autosomal recessive trait**.
- Mapped to mutations affecting the **"survival of motor neuron" (SMN1) gene**. The number of copies of the partially functional **SMN2 gene** determines disease severity and onset.
- **Nusinersen**, an antisense oligonucleotide, modifies SMN2 splicing to increase SMN protein and has shown effectiveness. Gene therapy using a viral vector with SMN1 is also being explored.

### Chronic childhood and juvenile proximal spinal muscular atrophy (Kugelberg-Welander syndrome, SMA 3 and Dubowitz syndrome SMA 2)

- A milder, slowly progressive form primarily involving the **proximal muscles of the limbs**.
- Most cases result from mutations in the **SMN gene**, with multiple copies of SMN2 leading to milder disease.
- Dubowitz syndrome (SMA 2) is an intermediate form, and intrathecal nusinersen has shown effectiveness.

### Kennedy Disease (X-Linked Bulbospinal Muscular Atrophy, AR Mutation)

- An unusual pattern of **distal muscular atrophy with prominent bulbar signs**.
- Onset typically in the third decade, with **X-linked inheritance**.
- Characterized by proximal shoulder and hip weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, facial fasciculations, and mild sensory neuropathy.
- **Two-thirds of affected men have gynecomastia**.
- The genetic defect is a **CAG expansion in the AR gene** (codes for the androgen receptor) on the X-chromosome. It was the first reported polyglutamine disease.

### Progressive Bulbar Palsy of Childhood (Fazio-Londe Disease)

- A rare disease characterized by progressive paralysis of facial, lingual, pharyngeal, laryngeal, and sometimes ocular muscles in children, adolescents, and young adults.
- Often presents with stridor and respiratory symptoms.
- Cause is mutations in **SLC52A3**, a riboflavin transporter, and some benefit is derived from riboflavin administration.

## Hereditary Forms of Spastic Paraplegia

### Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (Strümpell-Lorrain Disease)

- A disease identified globally, usually with autosomal dominant inheritance, but also recessive and X-linked forms.
- The clinical picture is the **gradual development of spastic weakness of the legs** with increasing difficulty in walking.
- Tendon reflexes are hyperactive, and plantar reflexes are extensor.
- In the pure form, sensory and other nervous functions are entirely intact.
- Pathologic studies show **degeneration of the corticospinal tracts** throughout the spinal cord and thinning of the columns of Goll.
- Numerous genetic mutations lead to this disease, with over 50 HSP loci (designated "SPG") identified. Common mutations are in **SPAST** (spastin) and **ATL1** (atlastin) genes.

### Variants of Familial Spastic Paraplegia

- The literature describes many syndromes where spastic paraplegia is combined with other neurologic abnormalities, such as:
    - Hereditary spastic paraplegia with ataxia (Ferguson-Critchley syndrome, SAX1 mutation).
    - Hereditary spastic paraplegia with extrapyramidal features.
    - Hereditary spastic paraplegia with optic atrophy (OPA3 mutation, Behr syndrome).
    - Hereditary spastic paraplegia with macular degeneration (Kjellin syndrome, SPG11 and SPG15 mutations).
    - Hereditary spastic paraplegia with developmental delay or dementia (e.g., Sjögren-Larsson syndrome with ichthyosis).
    - Hereditary spastic paraplegia with polyneuropathy.
    - Spastic paraparesis with distal muscle wasting (Troyer syndrome, SPG20 mutation).

# SYNDROME OF BLINDNESS DUE TO DEGENERATIVE DISORDERS

## Leber Hereditary Optic Atrophy

- A disease primarily affecting young adults, characterized by **rapid onset and subacute evolution of visual loss**, suggesting retrobulbar neuritis.
- Usually affects both eyes, one after the other within a year.
- **Central vision is lost before peripheral**, leading to bilateral central scotomata.
- The optic discs may initially swell and become hyperemic, then atrophic.
- Caused by **defective mitochondrial DNA inherited from the mother**.

## Retinitis Pigmentosa

- A retinal abiotrophy that usually begins in childhood and adolescence.
- Affects all retinal layers.
- Inheritance is often autosomal recessive, but also dominant and X-linked forms.
- The first symptom is usually **impairment of twilight vision (nyctalopia)**.
- Progresses to permanent visual impairment and constriction of visual fields.
- Ophthalmoscopic examination shows a characteristic triad of **pigmentary deposits (bone corpuscles), attenuated vessels, and pallor of the optic discs**.

## Stargardt Disease

- A bilaterally symmetrical, slowly progressive **macular degeneration**.
- Typically has onset between 6 and 20 years of age, leading to a **loss of central vision**.
- The macular region becomes gray or yellow-brown with pigmentary spots, and visual fields show central scotomata.
- Linked to mutations of **ABCA4 or ELOVL4**.

# SYNDROME OF CONGENITAL OR PROGRESSIVE DEAFNESS

- A group of hereditary, progressive cochleovestibular atrophies linked to degenerations of the nervous system.
- In 70% of cases of hereditary deafness, there are no other somatic or neurologic abnormalities.
- Associated with several specific syndromes:

## Hereditary Hearing Loss With Retinal Diseases

- Includes syndromes where retinitis pigmentosa appears in combination with hearing loss (e.g., **Usher syndrome**), polyneuropathy (**Refsum syndrome**), or hypogonadism/obesity (**Alstrom syndrome**).
- Also includes syndromes with optic atrophy and hearing loss (e.g., **Sylvester disease**, **Rosenberg-Chutorian syndrome**).

## Hereditary Hearing Loss With Diseases of the Nervous System

- Includes conditions where congenital deafness accompanies peripheral or central nervous system disease.
- Examples include:
    - Hereditary hearing loss with epilepsy (e.g., Hermann disease, May-White disease).
    - Hereditary hearing loss and ataxia (e.g., Telfer-Sugar-Jaeger syndrome, Rosenberg-Bergstrom syndrome).
    - Hereditary hearing loss with other neurologic syndromes, such as progressive polyneuropathy (Flynn-Aird syndrome) or bulbopontine paralysis.

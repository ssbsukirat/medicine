# Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)

## Overview

- GBS is an **acute, frequently severe, and fulminant polyradiculoneuropathy that is autoimmune in nature**.
- It occurs year-round at a rate of 10 to 20 cases per million annually, with ~5000–6000 cases per year in the United States.
- Males are at slightly higher risk than females.
- In Western countries, adults are more frequently affected than children.

## Clinical Manifestations

- GBS manifests as **rapidly evolving areflexic motor paralysis** with or without sensory disturbance.
- The usual pattern is an **ascending paralysis**, often first noticed as "rubbery legs".
- Weakness typically evolves over hours to a few days.
- **Tingling dysesthesias in the extremities** frequently accompany weakness.
- Legs are usually more affected than arms.
- **Facial diparesis** is present in 50% of affected individuals.
- Lower cranial nerves are frequently involved, causing bulbar weakness, difficulty handling secretions, and maintaining an airway; this may initially be mistaken for brainstem ischemia.
- **Pain in the neck, shoulder, back, or diffusely over the spine** is common in early stages, occurring in ~50% of patients.
- Most patients require hospitalization.
- Up to 30% require ventilatory assistance at some time during the illness.
- Need for mechanical ventilation is associated with:
    - More severe weakness on admission
    - Rapid tempo of progression
    - Presence of facial and/or bulbar weakness during the first week of symptoms
- **Fever and constitutional symptoms are absent at onset**; if present, they cast doubt on the diagnosis.
- Deep tendon reflexes attenuate or disappear within the first few days.
- Cutaneous sensory deficits (e.g., loss of pain and temperature sensation) are usually relatively mild.
- Functions subserved by large sensory fibers, such as **deep tendon reflexes and proprioception, are more severely affected**.
- Bladder dysfunction may occur in severe cases but is usually transient.
- If bladder dysfunction is prominent early or there is a sensory level, other diagnoses, especially spinal cord disease, should be considered.
- Once clinical worsening stops and the patient reaches a plateau (almost always within 4 weeks), further progression is unlikely.

## Autonomic Involvement

- Autonomic involvement is common, even in mild GBS.
- Usual manifestations include:
    - **Loss of vasomotor control** with wide fluctuations in blood pressure
    - Postural hypotension
    - Cardiac dysrhythmias
- These features require close monitoring and management and can be fatal.

## Pain in GBS

- Pain is a common feature.
- Acute pain (neck, shoulder, back, spine).
- Deep aching pain in weakened muscles, likened to overexercising.
- Dysesthetic pain in extremities, as a manifestation of sensory nerve fiber involvement.
- These pains are self-limited and often respond to standard analgesics.

## Subtypes

- ![[GBStypes.png]]
- Several subtypes are recognized, primarily by electrodiagnostic (EDx) and pathologic distinctions.
- **Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)** is the most common variant.
- **Axonal variants**, often clinically severe, include:
    - Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)
    - Acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN)
- **Limited or regional GBS syndromes** are also encountered.
- Notable regional variants include:
    - **Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS)**: presents as rapidly evolving ataxia and areflexia of limbs without weakness, and ophthalmoplegia, often with pupillary paralysis. Accounts for ~5% of cases and is strongly associated with **antibodies to ganglioside GQ1b**.
    - Pure sensory forms
    - Ophthalmoplegia with anti-GQ1b antibodies as part of severe motor-sensory GBS
    - GBS with severe bulbar and facial paralysis, sometimes associated with antecedent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and anti-GM2 antibodies
    - Acute pandysautonomia

### GBS Subtypes and EDx Features

|Subtype|EDx Features|
|:--|:--|
|**Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP)**|Earliest features: prolonged F-wave latencies, prolonged distal latencies, reduced amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs). Later: slowing of conduction velocity, conduction block, and temporal dispersion.|
|**Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN)**|Principal finding: **reduced amplitude of CMAPs** without conduction slowing or prolongation of distal latencies. Early on caused by conduction block, later can be due to axonal degeneration.|
|**Acute Motor Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN)**|Principal finding: **reduced amplitude of CMAPs and SNAPs** without conduction slowing or prolongation of distal latencies. Early on caused by conduction block, later can be due to axonal degeneration.|

## Antecedent Events

- Approximately **70% of GBS cases occur 1–3 weeks after an acute infectious process**, usually respiratory or gastrointestinal.
- Specific infections implicated:
    - **_Campylobacter jejuni_**: Precedes 20–30% of cases in North America, Europe, Australia. Also implicated in summer outbreaks of AMAN among children and young adults exposed to chickens in rural China.
    - Human herpes virus infection: Similar proportion (e.g., **CMV, Epstein-Barr virus**).
    - Other viruses: HIV, hepatitis E, Zika.
    - _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_.
    - **Zika virus**: Recently implicated in increased GBS incidence in Brazil and other endemic regions.
    - **SARS-CoV-2 infection**: Reported during COVID-19 pandemic, but causal relationship not established.
- Recent immunizations:
    - **Swine influenza vaccine (1976)**: Most notable example.
    - **Seasonal influenza vaccines (1992-1994)**: Resulted in only one additional GBS case per million vaccinated; more recent ones have risk <1 per million.
    - **H1N1 vaccination**: Demonstrated at most a slight increased risk.
    - Meningococcal vaccinations (Menactra) do not appear to carry increased risk.
    - **Older-type rabies vaccine** (prepared in nervous system tissue): Implicated as a trigger in developing countries, mechanism presumably immunization against neural antigens.
    - **SARS-CoV-2 vaccines using adenovirus vectors**: Appear to have an increased risk of GBS.
    - **Messenger RNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2**: Do not appear to have an increased risk.
- GBS occurs more frequently than chance in patients with:
    - Lymphoma (including Hodgkin’s disease)
    - HIV-seropositive individuals
    - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Can occur as a complication of **immune checkpoint inhibitors** used to treat various cancers.

## Immunopathogenesis

- **Strong evidence supports an autoimmune basis** for AIDP (most common and best-studied type of GBS), and the concept extends to all GBS subtypes.
- Both cellular and humoral immune mechanisms likely contribute to tissue damage in AIDP.
    - **T-cell activation** suggested by elevated cytokine and cytokine receptor levels in serum (IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor) and CSF (IL-6, TNFα, IFNγ).
    - AIDP is analogous to **experimental allergic neuritis (EAN)**, a T cell-mediated immunopathy induced by immune sensitization against peripheral nerve proteins (e.g., P2 protein).
    - **Autoantibodies** directed against T cell-independent nonprotein determinants may be central to many cases.
- All GBS likely results from **immune responses to nonself antigens** (infectious agents, vaccines) that **misdirect to host nerve tissue** via a **molecular mimicry** mechanism.
- Neural targets are likely **glycoconjugates, specifically gangliosides**.
    - Gangliosides are complex glycosphingolipids with sialic acid residues, involved in cell-cell interactions, receptor modulation, and growth regulation.
    - They are exposed on plasma membranes, making them susceptible to antibody attack.
    - Present in large quantity in human nervous tissues and key sites like nodes of Ranvier.
- **Antiganglioside antibodies** are common in GBS (20–50% of cases).
    - Most frequently to **GM1**, particularly in AMAN and AMSAN, and preceded by _C. jejuni_ infection.
    - **_C. jejuni_ isolates** from GBS patients have surface glycolipid structures that antigenically **cross-react with gangliosides**, including GM1.
    - Sialic acid residues from pathogenic _C. jejuni_ strains can activate dendritic cells via TLR4, promoting B-cell differentiation and amplifying humoral autoimmunity.
    - **Bovine brain ganglioside administration** for neuropathies has led to AMAN with high anti-GM1 antibodies.
    - Experimentally, **anti-GM1 antibodies can trigger complement-mediated injury** at paranodal axon-glial junctions, disrupting sodium channel clustering and contributing to conduction block.
    - **Anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies** are found in >90% of patients with **MFS**. Titers are highest early. Not found in other GBS forms unless extraocular motor nerve involvement exists, possibly because these nerves are enriched in GQ1b gangliosides. A monoclonal anti-GQ1b antibody from a MFS patient blocked neuromuscular transmission experimentally.
- Some AIDP autoantibodies may recognize glycolipid heterocomplexes.
- These observations strongly suggest autoantibodies play a pathogenic role, but proof of pathogenicity via direct passive transfer to naive hosts is inconclusive. One case of possible maternal-fetal transplacental transfer has been described.

### Principal Antiglycolipid Antibodies Implicated in Immune Neuropathies

|Antibody Target(s)|Associated GBS Subtype(s)/Syndrome(s)|
|:--|:--|
|**IgG anti-GM1**|Strongly associated with **Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN)** and Acute Motor Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN).|
|**IgG anti-GD1a**|Strongly associated with **Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN)** and Acute Motor Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN). Also detected in a small percentage of patients with pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness.|
|**IgG anti-GQ1b**|Strongly associated with **Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS)**, its incomplete forms (acute ophthalmoparesis, acute ataxic neuropathy), and Bickerstaff’s brainstem encephalitis. Found in >90% of MFS patients. Often cross-reacts with GT1a.|
|**IgG anti-GT1a**|Often cross-reacts with GQ1b. Half of patients with pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness have these antibodies.|
|**Anti-GM2**|Associated with GBS with severe bulbar and facial paralysis, sometimes linked to antecedent CMV infection.|

## Pathophysiology

- In **demyelinating forms of GBS (e.g., AIDP)**:
    - **Conduction block** is the basis for flaccid paralysis and sensory disturbance.
    - Axonal connections remain intact, allowing rapid recovery with remyelination.
    - In severe cases, **secondary axonal degeneration** can occur, correlating with slower recovery and greater residual disability.
    - An early step in tissue damage appears to be **complement deposition along the outer surface of the Schwann cell**.
    - Complement activation leads to **vesicular disintegration of the myelin sheath** and recruitment of activated macrophages, which damage myelin and axons.
- In **axonal forms (AMAN and AMSAN)**:
    - A **primary axonal pattern** is encountered electrophysiologically (low-amplitude compound muscle action potentials).
    - Rapid recovery in many cases suggests low amplitudes are often from **reversible conduction block** due to antibody binding to ion channel proteins in nodes and paranodes.
    - In severe cases, **axonal degeneration** can occur, leading to much slower recovery.
    - Complement is deposited along with IgG at the **nodes of Ranvier along large motor axons**.
    - Antibodies against GD1a appear to favor binding to motor rather than sensory nerve roots in AMAN, despite expression on both fiber types.

## Laboratory Features

- **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)**:
    - **Elevated CSF protein level** (1–10 g/L [100–1000 mg/dL]) **without accompanying pleocytosis**(albuminocytologic dissociation) is distinctive.
    - CSF is often normal if symptoms have been present for ≤48 hours.
    - Protein level is usually elevated by the end of the first week.
    - A transient increase in CSF white cell count (10–100/μL) occurs occasionally. A sustained CSF pleocytosis suggests an alternative diagnosis (e.g., viral myelitis) or concurrent diagnosis (e.g., unrecognized HIV, leukemia/lymphoma infiltration, neurosarcoidosis).
- **Electrodiagnostic (EDx) Features**:
    - Mild or absent in early stages and lag behind clinical evolution.
    - In **AIDP**, earliest features are:
        - **Prolonged F-wave latencies**
        - **Prolonged distal latencies**
        - **Reduced amplitudes of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs)**
        - Later: slowing of conduction velocity, conduction block, and temporal dispersion.
        - Sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) may be normal in feet (e.g., sural nerve) when abnormal in arms, indicating a non-"length-dependent" polyneuropathy.
    - In **AMAN and AMSAN**, the principal EDx finding is **reduced amplitude of CMAPs** (and SNAPS with AMSAN) **without conduction slowing or prolongation of distal latencies**. This is initially caused by conduction block, but later can be due to axonal degeneration.

## Diagnosis

- GBS is a **descriptive entity**.
- Diagnosis of AIDP is made by recognizing the pattern of **rapidly evolving paralysis with areflexia, absence of fever or other systemic symptoms, and characteristic antecedent events**.
- The Brighton Collaboration developed and validated case definitions for GBS, useful for epidemiologic studies.
- **Laboratory tests are primarily helpful to exclude mimics**.
- CSF pleocytosis is seen with poliomyelitis, acute flaccid myelitis, Lyme, and CMV polyradiculitis.
- EDx features may be minimal early, and CSF protein may not rise until the end of the first week.
- If GBS is strongly suspected, **treatment should be initiated without waiting** for characteristic EDx and CSF findings to evolve.
- Patients with GBS risk factors for HIV or with CSF pleocytosis should have a serologic test for HIV.
- **Differential diagnosis** includes:
    - Acute myelopathies (especially with prolonged back pain and sphincter disturbances)
    - Diphtheria (early oropharyngeal disturbances)
    - Lyme polyradiculitis and other tick-borne paralyses
    - Porphyria (abdominal pain, seizures, psychosis)
    - Vasculitic neuropathy
    - Poliomyelitis and acute flaccid myelitis (wild-type poliovirus, West Nile virus, enterovirus D68, enterovirus A71, Japanese encephalitis virus)
    - CMV polyradiculitis (in immunocompromised patients)
    - Critical illness neuropathy or myopathy
    - Neuromuscular junction disorders such as myasthenia gravis and botulism (pupillary reactivity lost early)
    - Poisonings with organophosphates, thallium, or arsenic; paralytic shellfish poisoning; severe hypophosphatemia
- Acute flaccid myelitis may pose particular challenges as sphincter disturbances are often absent.

## Treatment

- Treatment should be initiated as soon after diagnosis as possible, as **each day counts**.
- Immunotherapy effectiveness is unknown ~2 weeks after first motor symptoms.
- If the patient has reached the plateau stage, treatment is probably no longer indicated, unless severe weakness suggests ongoing immunologic attack.
- **High-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIg)** or **plasmapheresis (PLEX)** are equally effective for typical GBS.
- **Combination of IVIg and PLEX is not significantly better** than either alone.
- **IVIg is often chosen first** due to ease of administration and good safety record.
    - Usually 2 g/kg body weight, administered as five daily infusions.
    - Anti-idiotypic antibodies in IVIg may neutralize GBS autoantibodies.
- A course of **PLEX** usually consists of ~40–50 mL/kg plasma exchange 4–5 times over 7–10 days.
- Meta-analysis shows treatment reduces need for mechanical ventilation (from 27% to 14% with PLEX) and increases likelihood of full recovery at 1 year (from 55% to 68%).
- Functionally significant improvement may occur toward the end of the first week or be delayed for several weeks.
- Lack of noticeable improvement after one course is **not an indication to treat with the alternate therapy**.
- Occasional patients treated early may relapse within a month; **brief retreatment with the original therapy is usually effective**.
- **Glucocorticoids have not been found to be effective**.
- Very mild cases, especially those at plateau, may be managed conservatively without IVIg or PLEX.

## Supportive Care and Monitoring

- In the worsening phase, most patients require monitoring in a **critical care setting**.
- Particular attention to:
    - **Vital capacity**
    - **Heart rhythm**
    - **Blood pressure**
    - Nutrition
    - Deep-vein thrombosis prophylaxis
    - Cardiovascular status
    - Early consideration of tracheotomy (after 2 weeks of intubation)
    - Chest physiotherapy
- ~30% of patients require ventilatory assistance, sometimes for prolonged periods.
- **Frequent turning and assiduous skin care** are important.
- **Daily range-of-motion exercises** to avoid joint contractures.
- **Daily reassurance** about the generally good outlook for recovery.

## Prognosis and Recovery

- Approximately **85% of patients achieve a full functional recovery** within several months to a year.
- Minor findings (e.g., areflexia) may persist, and patients often complain of continued symptoms, including fatigue.
- **Mortality rate is <5%** in optimal settings, usually from secondary pulmonary complications.
- Outlook is worst in patients with **severe proximal motor and sensory axonal damage** (primary or secondary) where successful regeneration cannot occur.
- Other factors that worsen recovery outlook:
    - **Advanced age**
    - A **fulminant or severe attack**
    - A **delay in the onset of treatment**
- Between 5 and 10% of patients have one or more late relapses; many are then classified as **chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)**.

# Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)

## Overview

- Distinguished from GBS by its **chronic course**.
- Shares many features with the common demyelinating form of GBS:
    - Elevated CSF protein levels
    - EDx findings of acquired demyelination
- Most cases occur in adults; males affected slightly more often than females.
- Incidence is lower than GBS, but due to protracted course, **prevalence is greater**.
- Like GBS, CIDP and its variants can be triggered by immune checkpoint inhibitors.

## Clinical Manifestations

- Onset is usually **gradual over a few months or longer**.
- In some cases, initial attack is indistinguishable from GBS.
- An **acute-onset form of CIDP may mimic GBS** but should be considered if it deteriorates >9 weeks after onset or relapses at least three times.
- Symptoms are both **motor and sensory** in most cases.
- Weakness of limbs is usually **symmetric**.
- Can be strikingly asymmetric in **multifocal acquired demyelinating sensory and motor (MADSAM) neuropathy variant** (Lewis-Sumner syndrome), where discrete peripheral nerves are involved.
- Considerable variability:
    - Some patients have a **chronic progressive course**.
    - Others (usually younger patients) have a **relapsing and remitting course**.
- A small proportion have cranial nerve findings, including external ophthalmoplegia.
- Some have only motor findings.
- A small proportion present with a relatively pure syndrome of **sensory ataxia**.
    - Seen in chronic inflammatory sensory polyradiculopathy (CISP) variant (demyelination predominantly at sensory roots).
    - Seen with distal acquired demyelinating symmetric (DADS) variant.

## Antibodies

- Approximately 10% of cases are associated with **IgG4 isotype antibodies directed against contactin-1 (CNTN1) or neurofascin 155 (NF155)**. These cases involve early axonal damage, severe distal motor involvement, or sensory ataxia with tremor.
- Less commonly, **IgM anti-NF140/186 CIDP** is associated with sensory ataxia without tremor, low-amplitude CMAPs (conduction block or axonal degeneration), and nephrotic syndrome.
- **Anti-contactin associated protein-1 (Caspr1) antibodies** occur in CIDP associated with severe neuropathic pain.
- A minority of patients have serum antibodies against **P0, myelin P2 protein, or PMP22**.

## Prognosis

- CIDP tends to **ameliorate over time with treatment**.
- Many years after onset, nearly 75% of patients have reasonable functional status.
- **Death from CIDP is uncommon**.

## Diagnosis

- Diagnosis rests on characteristic clinical, CSF, and electrophysiologic findings.
- **CSF**:
    - Usually **acellular with an elevated protein level**, sometimes several times normal.
    - CSF pleocytosis should lead to consideration of HIV infection, leukemia or lymphoma, and neurosarcoidosis.
- **EDx findings**:
    - Variable degrees of **conduction slowing**
    - **Prolonged distal latencies**
    - Distal and **temporal dispersion of CMAPs**
    - **Conduction block** as principal features. The presence of conduction block is a certain sign of an acquired demyelinating process.
    - Evidence of **axonal loss** (presumably secondary to demyelination) is present in >50% of patients.
- **Serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation** is indicated to search for monoclonal gammopathy and associated conditions.
- **MRI** can demonstrate enlarged nerves, clumping of cauda equina, and enhancement.
- **Ultrasound** is cheaper and often more readily available, showing nerve enlargement at roots or more distally. Imaging complements EDx findings and increases sensitivity.
- In all patients with presumptive CIDP, it is reasonable to exclude:
    - Vasculitis
    - Collagen vascular disease (especially SLE)
    - Chronic hepatitis
    - HIV infection
    - Amyloidosis
    - Diabetes mellitus
- Other associated conditions include inflammatory bowel disease and lymphoma.

## Pathogenesis

- Biopsy in typical CIDP reveals **little inflammation and onion-bulb changes** (imbricated layers of attenuated Schwann cell processes surrounding an axon) resulting from recurrent demyelination and remyelination.
- Response to therapy suggests CIDP is **immune-mediated**.
- **CIDP responds to glucocorticoids, whereas GBS does not**.
- **Passive transfer of demyelination** into experimental animals using IgG purified from some CIDP patients supports a humoral autoimmune pathogenesis.
- **IgG4 isotype antibodies directed against CNTN1, NF155, NF140/186, and Caspr1** are associated with early nodal and paranodal damage.
    - CNTN1 and Caspr1 interact with NF155 at paranodal axoglial junctions.
    - Passive transfer of IgG4 CNTN1 antibodies produces paranodal damage and ataxia in rodents.
- A CIDP-like illness developed spontaneously in NOD mice when immune co-stimulatory molecule B7-2 (CD86) was genetically deleted, suggesting CIDP can result from altered T cell triggering by antigen-presenting cells.

## Association with Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS)

- As many as 25% of patients with CIDP features also have **monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)**.
- Cases associated with monoclonal IgA or IgG kappa usually respond to treatment as favorably as cases without MGUS.
- Patients with **IgM-kappa monoclonal gammopathy and antibodies directed against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG)** have a distinct demyelinating polyneuropathy.
    - More sensory findings, usually only distal weakness, and a **poor response to immunotherapy**.
    - In most, monoclonal IgM binds to MAG (a normal peripheral nerve constituent found in paranodal regions of Schwann cells).
    - Binding appears specific for a polysaccharide epitope found in other myelin glycoproteins (P0, PMP22) and glycosphingolipids.
    - IgM paraprotein is incorporated into myelin sheaths, widening myelin lamellae spacing, producing a distinctive ultrastructural pattern.
    - Demyelination and remyelination are hallmarks, but axonal loss develops over time.

## Treatment

- Most authorities initiate treatment when progression is rapid or walking is compromised.
- If mild, management can be expectant, awaiting spontaneous remission.
- **Controlled studies show high-dose IVIg, subcutaneous Ig (scIg), PLEX, and glucocorticoids are all more effective than placebo**.
- **Initial therapy is usually IVIg**.
    - Administered as 2.0 g/kg body weight in divided doses over 2–5 days.
    - Three monthly courses generally recommended before concluding failure.
    - If patient responds, infusion intervals can be gradually increased or dosage decreased (e.g., 1 g/kg every 3–4 weeks).
- **scIg** is an option for patients requiring more frequent IVIg, experiencing side effects, having poor venous access, or for convenience.
    - Administered 2–3 times a week, total monthly dosage same or slightly higher than IVIg.
- **PLEX** appears as effective as IVIg.
    - Initiated at 2–3 treatments per week for 6 weeks.
    - Periodic retreatment may be required.
- **Glucocorticoids** are another option.
    - E.g., 60–80 mg prednisone PO daily for 1–2 months, followed by gradual dose reduction.
    - Long-term adverse effects are problematic (bone demineralization, GI bleeding, cushingoid changes).
- As many as one-third of patients fail to respond adequately to initial therapy; a different treatment should then be tried.
- Patients who fail IVIg, scIg, PLEX, and glucocorticoids may benefit from **immunosuppressive agents**.
    - Azathioprine
    - Methotrexate
    - Cyclosporine
    - Cyclophosphamide
    - These can be used alone or as adjunctive therapy.
- **CIDP associated with anti-CNTN1, NF155, NF140/186, and Caspr1 antibodies (IgG4 subclass)** is typically **refractory to IVIg**, but several studies suggest a response to **rituximab**.
- Periodic reassessment of risks and benefits for these therapies is required.
- In patients with a CIDP-like neuropathy who fail to respond, evaluate for **POEMS syndrome** (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin changes).

# Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)

## Overview

- Distinctive but uncommon neuropathy.
- Presents as **slowly progressive motor weakness and atrophy** evolving over years.
- Distribution of selected nerve trunks, associated with **sites of persistent focal motor conduction block** in the same nerve trunks.
- **Sensory fibers are relatively spared**.
- Arms affected more frequently than legs.
- > 75% of patients are male.
    
- Some cases confused with lower motor neuron forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
- <50% of patients present with high titers of polyclonal IgM antibody to the ganglioside GM1.
    - High concentrations of GM1 gangliosides are normal constituents of nodes of Ranvier in peripheral nerve fibers.
- Pathology reveals **demyelination and mild inflammatory changes** at the sites of conduction block.

## Treatment

- Most patients respond to **high-dose IVIg or scIg** (dosages as for CIDP).
- **Periodic retreatment is required** (usually at least monthly) to maintain benefit.
- Some refractory patients have responded to **rituximab or cyclophosphamide**.
- **Glucocorticoids and plasmapheresis (PE) are not effective**.

# Neuropathies with Monoclonal Gammopathy

## Multiple Myeloma

- Clinically overt polyneuropathy occurs in ~5% of patients with common type (lytic or diffuse osteoporotic bone lesions).
    - These neuropathies are **sensorimotor, usually mild and slowly progressive**.
    - Generally **do not reverse** with successful suppression of myeloma.
    - EDx and pathologic features consistent with **axonal degeneration**.
- Myeloma with **osteosclerotic features** (3% of all myelomas) is associated with polyneuropathy in one-half of cases.
    - These neuropathies (which may also occur with solitary plasmacytoma) are distinct:
        - **Demyelinating or mixed axonal and demyelinating** by EDx, with elevated CSF protein, and clinically resemble CIDP.
        - Often **respond to radiation therapy or removal of the primary lesion**.
        - Associated with different monoclonal proteins and light chains (almost always lambda, vs. kappa in lytic type).
        - Typically **refractory to standard CIDP treatments**.
        - May occur with other systemic findings, collectively known as **POEMS syndrome**.
            - POEMS features: thickening of skin, hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, anasarca, clubbing of fingers.
            - **Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are increased** in serum and thought to play a pathogenic role.
    - Treatment of neuropathy is best directed at the osteosclerotic myeloma using surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
- Neuropathies also encountered in other systemic conditions with gammopathy:
    - Waldenström macroglobulinemia
    - Primary systemic amyloidosis
    - Cryoglobulinemic states (mixed essential cryoglobulinemia, some hepatitis C cases)

## Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS)

- Chronic polyneuropathies associated with MGUS are usually linked to **IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes**.
- Most patients present with **isolated sensory symptoms in distal extremities** and have EDx features of an axonal sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
    - These resemble idiopathic sensory polyneuropathy, and MGUS might be coincidental.
    - Usually **do not respond to immunotherapies** aimed at reducing monoclonal protein concentration.
- Some patients present with **generalized weakness and sensory loss and EDx studies indistinguishable from CIDP** without MGUS.
    - Their response to immunosuppressive agents is similar.
- **Exception**: Syndrome of **IgM-kappa monoclonal gammopathy associated with an indolent, long-standing, sometimes static sensory neuropathy, frequently with tremor and sensory ataxia**.
    - Most patients are men aged >50 years.
    - In the majority, monoclonal IgM binds to **myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG)**, a normal peripheral nerve constituent found in paranodal regions of Schwann cells.
    - Binding appears specific for a polysaccharide epitope also found in other nerve myelin glycoproteins (P0, PMP22) and glycosphingolipids.
    - IgM paraprotein is incorporated into myelin sheaths, widening the spacing of myelin lamellae, producing a distinctive ultrastructural pattern.
    - Demyelination and remyelination are hallmarks, but axonal loss develops over time.
    - These **anti-MAG polyneuropathies are typically refractory to immunotherapy**.
- In a small proportion of patients (30% at 10 years), MGUS will evolve into frankly malignant conditions (e.g., multiple myeloma or lymphoma).

# Vasculitic Neuropathy

## Overview

- Peripheral nerve involvement is **common in polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)** (half of clinical cases, 100% postmortem).
- Most common pattern is **multifocal (asymmetric) motor-sensory neuropathy (mononeuropathy multiplex)** due to ischemic lesions of nerve trunks and roots.
- Some cases present as a distal, symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
- Neuropathy symptoms are a common presenting complaint in PAN.
- EDx findings are those of an **axonal process**.
- **Small- to medium-sized arteries of the vasa nervorum**, particularly epineural vessels, are affected in PAN, resulting in widespread ischemic neuropathy.
- A **high frequency of neuropathy occurs in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome [CSS])**.

## Clinical Features and Diagnosis

- Systemic vasculitis should always be considered with a subacute or chronically evolving **mononeuropathy multiplex** in conjunction with **constitutional symptoms** (fever, anorexia, weight loss, loss of energy, malaise, nonspecific pains).
- Diagnosis of suspected vasculitic neuropathy is made by a **combined nerve and muscle biopsy**, with serial section or skip-serial techniques.
- Approximately one-third of biopsy-proven cases are "**nonsystemic**".
    - Vasculitis appears to affect only peripheral nerves.
    - Constitutional symptoms are absent.
    - Course is more indolent than PAN.
    - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be elevated, but other systemic disease tests are negative.
    - Clinically silent involvement of other organs is likely, and vasculitis is frequently found in muscle biopsied concurrently with nerve.

## Associations

- Vasculitic neuropathy may be seen as part of the vasculitis syndrome occurring in other **connective tissue disorders**:
    - Rheumatoid arthritis (most frequent)
    - Mixed cryoglobulinemia
    - Sjögren’s syndrome
    - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener’s)
    - Hypersensitivity angiitis
    - SLE
    - Progressive systemic sclerosis
- Some vasculitides are associated with **antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs)**.
    - **cANCAs** are directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) and associated with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
    - **pANCAs** target myeloperoxidase (MPO) and are typically associated with microscopic polyangiitis, CSS, and less commonly PAN. MPO/pANCA has also been seen in minocycline-induced vasculitis.

## Management

- Consists of **treatment of the underlying condition**.
- **Aggressive use of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide** has resulted in dramatic improvements in outcome, with 5-year survival rates >80%.
- **Combination of rituximab and glucocorticoids** is not inferior to cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids; thus, it is recommended as standard initial treatment, particularly for ANCA-associated vasculitis.
- **Mepolizumab** (an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody), added to standard care, is effective for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

# Anti-Hu Paraneoplastic Neuropathy

## Overview

- Uncommon, immune-mediated disorder.
- Manifests as a **sensory neuronopathy** (selective damage to sensory nerve bodies in dorsal root ganglia).

## Clinical Manifestations

- Onset is often **asymmetric** with dysesthesias and sensory loss in limbs.
- Soon progresses to affect all limbs, torso, and face.
- **Marked sensory ataxia, pseudoathetosis, and inability to walk, stand, or even sit unsupported** are frequent features due to extensive deafferentation.

## Pathogenesis and Diagnosis

- Subacute sensory neuronopathy may be idiopathic, but **more than half of cases are paraneoplastic**, primarily related to **lung cancer**, with most being **small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)**.
- Diagnosis of underlying SCLC requires awareness, testing for the **paraneoplastic antibody**, and often PET scanning for the tumor.
- The target antigens are a family of **RNA-binding proteins (HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1)**, normally expressed only by neurons.
- These same proteins are usually expressed by SCLC, triggering an immune response (antibodies and cytotoxic T cells) that **cross-react with the Hu proteins of dorsal root ganglion neurons**, resulting in immune-mediated neuronal destruction.
- An encephalomyelitis may accompany the sensory neuronopathy and presumably has the same pathogenesis.
- Neurologic symptoms usually **precede the identification of SCLC by ≤6 months**.
- The sensory neuronopathy runs its course in a few weeks or months and stabilizes, leaving the patient disabled.

## Treatment Responsiveness

- Most cases are **unresponsive to treatment** with glucocorticoids, IVIg, plasmapheresis (PE), or immunosuppressant drugs.

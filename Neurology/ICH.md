# Intracranial Hemorrhage Overview

## Definition and Classification

- **Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)** is a form of stroke.
- ICH patients are more likely to present with headache compared to ischemic stroke.
- Brain imaging is required to distinguish ICH from ischemic stroke.
- Hemorrhages are classified by their location and underlying vascular pathology.
- Categories of hemorrhage include:
    - **Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)**: Bleeding directly into the brain parenchyma.
    - **Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)** of the brain.
    - Subdural and epidural spaces (usually trauma-related).
    - Subarachnoid hemorrhage (due to trauma or aneurysmal rupture).

## Diagnosis and Imaging

- Intracranial hemorrhage is often identified using **noncontrast CT imaging** during acute stroke evaluation.
    - CT is generally the preferred method for acute stroke evaluation due to wider availability and logistical ease compared to MRI.
    - CT is highly sensitive and specific for intracranial hemorrhage and determines the location(s) of bleeding.
- The location of the hemorrhage narrows the differential diagnosis.

# Emergency Management

## Initial Priorities and Stabilization

- Close attention should be paid to **airway management** because reduced consciousness is common and often progressive.
- The initial blood pressure (BP) should be maintained until the CT scan results are reviewed.
- Patients with **cerebellar hemorrhages** who have depressed mental status or radiographic evidence of hydrocephalus require **urgent neurosurgical evaluation** and close monitoring due to the risk of rapid deterioration.
- Stuporous or comatose patients with signs of herniation are treated presumptively for elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP):
    - Tracheal intubation and sedation.
    - Administration of osmotic diuretics like mannitol or hypertonic saline.
    - Elevation of the head of the bed.
    - Surgical consultation should be obtained.
- Other principal aspects of emergency management include reversal of coagulopathy and consideration of surgical evacuation.

## Blood Pressure Management

- There is debate regarding the optimal target for lowering blood pressure in acute ICH.
    - It remains unclear if lowering BP reduces hematoma growth.
- Clinical trials showed that systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be safely lowered acutely and rapidly to **<140 mmHg**in patients with spontaneous ICH whose initial SBP was 150–220 mmHg.
    - The INTERACT2 trial showed a significant shift to improved outcomes, although mortality was similar in the lower BP arm (target SBP <140 mmHg) compared to the higher BP arm (target SBP <180 mmHg).
    - The ATACH2 trial, similarly designed, showed no difference in outcome between these two groups.
- **Nonvasodilating IV drugs** such as nicardipine, labetalol, or esmolol should be used to lower BP.
- In patients with ICP monitors, maintaining the **Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP)** (Mean Arterial Pressure [MAP] minus ICP) at **50–70 mmHg** is reasonable.

# Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)

## General Information and Epidemiology

- ICH accounts for approximately **10% of all strokes**.
- About 35–45% of patients die within the first month.
- Incidence rates are particularly high in Asians and blacks.

## Major Causes and Risk Factors

- Most hemorrhages are caused by:
    - Hypertension.
    - Coagulopathy.
    - Sympathomimetic drugs (cocaine, methamphetamine).
    - Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).
- Risk factors that increase risk include advanced age, heavy alcohol use, and low-dose aspirin use (in those without symptomatic cardiovascular disease).
- Cocaine or methamphetamine use is one of the most important causes in the young.
    - Cocaine enhances sympathetic activity, causing acute, sometimes severe, hypertension, potentially leading to hemorrhage.

## Hypertensive ICH

- **Pathophysiology:** Usually results from spontaneous rupture of a small penetrating artery deep in the brain.
- **Most Common Sites:** Basal ganglia (especially the putamen), thalamus, cerebellum, and pons.
    - Small arteries in these areas are prone to hypertension-induced vascular injury.
- The hemorrhage may be small, or large enough to compress adjacent tissue, potentially causing herniation and death.
- Blood dissecting into the ventricular space increases morbidity and may cause hydrocephalus.
- **Evolution:** Most develop over 30–90 minutes. Those associated with anticoagulants may evolve over 24–48 hours.
    - About one-third of patients without coagulopathy may still have significant hematoma expansion within the first day.
    - Resolution: After 1–6 months, the hemorrhage resolves into a slitlike cavity lined with a glial scar and hemosiderin-laden macrophages.
- **Clinical Presentation:** Abrupt onset of a focal neurologic deficit.
    - Symptoms commonly worsen over 30–90 minutes.
    - Associated with diminishing consciousness and signs of increased ICP (headache, vomiting).
    - Seizures are uncommon.

## Clinical Syndromes by Location (Hypertensive ICH)

### Putaminal Hemorrhage (Basal Ganglia)

- The most common site.
- The adjacent internal capsule is usually damaged.
- **Sentinel Sign:** Contralateral hemiparesis.
    - Mild presentation: Face sags, speech slurred, gradual weakening of arm/leg; eyes deviate away from side of hemiparesis.
- Large hemorrhages lead to drowsiness, stupor (due to upper brainstem compression), and coma.
    - Signs of coma: Deep, irregular respiration; dilated and fixed ipsilateral pupil; decerebrate rigidity.
- Edema in adjacent brain tissue can cause progressive deterioration over 12–72 hours in milder cases.

### Thalamic Hemorrhage

- Produces contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis (due to pressure on/dissection into the internal capsule).
- A **prominent sensory deficit** (all modalities) is usually present.
- Other signs:
    - Aphasia (often with preserved verbal repetition) if dominant thalamus is involved.
    - Constructional apraxia or mutism if nondominant hemorrhage.
    - Homonymous visual field defect.
- **Ocular Disturbances** (due to extension into upper midbrain):
    - Eyes deviate downward and inward (looking at the nose).
    - Unequal pupils with absent light reaction.
    - Skew deviation (eye opposite hemorrhage displaced downward and medially).
    - Ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome, absent convergence, paralysis of vertical gaze, and retraction nystagmus.
- **Chronic Sequelae:** Contralateral pain syndrome (Déjérine-Roussy syndrome) may develop later.

### Pontine Hemorrhage

- Often causes **deep coma with quadriplegia** rapidly (over minutes).
- Typical signs: Prominent decerebrate rigidity and **“pinpoint” (1 mm) pupils that react to light**.
- Impairment of reflex horizontal eye movements (oculocephalic/oculovestibular maneuvers).
- Hyperpnea, severe hypertension, and hyperhidrosis are common.
- Prognosis: Most patients ultimately die or develop a locked-in state, but small hemorrhages allow for survival and significant recovery.

### Cerebellar Hemorrhage

- Usually develops over several hours.
- Characterized by **occipital headache, repeated vomiting, and ataxia of gait**.
- Dizziness or vertigo may be prominent.
- Signs: Paresis of conjugate lateral gaze toward the side of the hemorrhage, forced eye deviation to the opposite side, or ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy.
    - Less frequent ocular signs: blepharospasm, involuntary closure of one eye, ocular bobbing, and skew deviation.
- Progression: Patient often becomes stuporous/comatose from brainstem compression or obstructive hydrocephalus.
- **Treatment:** Immediate surgical evacuation is lifesaving if performed before severe brainstem compression.
    - Hydrocephalus from fourth ventricle compression requires definitive hematoma evacuation rather than ventricular drainage alone.
- Prognosis: Full recovery is common if deep cerebellar nuclei are spared.

### Lobar Hemorrhage

- Major deficit depends on the lobe:
    - Occipital: Hemianopsia.
    - Left Temporal: Aphasia and delirium.
    - Parietal: Hemisensory loss.
    - Frontal: Arm weakness.
- Large hemorrhages can cause stupor or coma if they compress the thalamus or midbrain.
- Most patients have focal headaches; more than half vomit or are drowsy.
- Stiff neck and seizures are uncommon.

## Other Causes of ICH

### Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA)

- Disease of the elderly where arteriolar degeneration and amyloid deposition occur in cerebral artery walls.
- Causes single and recurrent **lobar hemorrhages**.
- Most common cause of lobar hemorrhage in the elderly.
- Can be suspected in patients with multiple hemorrhages/infarcts or **"microbleeds"** (seen on iron-sensitive MRI).
- Definitive diagnosis requires pathological demonstration of Congo red staining of amyloid in cerebral vessels.
- Allelic variations of the apolipoprotein E gene (ε2 and ε4) are associated with increased risk.
- CAA-associated vasculitis (if inflammation is present on lumbar puncture) may benefit from oral glucocorticoids.
- Noninflammatory CAA has no specific treatment.
- Oral anticoagulants are typically avoided in CAA.

### Stimulant Use (Cocaine/Methamphetamine)

- Frequent cause of stroke in young patients (<45 years).
- Associated with ICH, ischemic stroke, and SAH.
- Slightly more than half of stimulant-related intracranial hemorrhages are intracerebral.
- May cause saccular aneurysm rupture due to acute hypertension.

### Trauma

- Must be considered in any patient with unexplained acute neurologic deficit, especially following a fall.
- Common bleeding sites: intraparenchymal (temporal/inferior frontal lobes), subarachnoid, subdural, and epidural spaces.

### Anticoagulant Therapy and Hematologic Disorders

- Anticoagulant-related ICHs can occur at any location (often lobar or subdural).
    - They may evolve over 24–48 hours, particularly if coagulopathy is insufficiently reversed.
- ICH associated with hematologic disorders (e.g., leukemia, thrombocytopenic purpura) can occur at any site and may present as multiple ICHs.
    - Skin and mucous membrane bleeding may provide a diagnostic clue.

### Hemorrhage into a Brain Tumor

- May be the first manifestation of neoplasm.
- Common metastatic tumors associated with ICH: choriocarcinoma, malignant melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and bronchogenic carcinoma.
- Glioblastoma multiforme (adults) and medulloblastoma (children) may also have areas of ICH.

### Hypertensive Encephalopathy

- Acute syndrome resulting from malignant hypertension.
- Associated with headache, nausea, vomiting, convulsions, confusion, stupor, and coma.
- Focal signs are infrequent and suggest another vascular disease.
- Presents with retinal hemorrhages, papilledema (hypertensive retinopathy), and evidence of renal/cardiac disease.
- MRI shows reversible posterior (occipital > frontal) brain edema (reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy).
- Treatment: Lowering BP reverses the process.
    - Aggressive BP lowering (to SBP 140–180 mmHg) should be avoided, favoring less aggressive measures, unlike in hypertensive ICH.
    - Absence of altered mental status or a prodrome prior to ICH favors hypertensive ICH.

### Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis

- Causes cortical vein hypertension, cerebral edema, and venous infarction.
- May progress to ICH surrounding the occluded sinus or within the drainage region of the vein of Labbé (producing posterior temporal inferior parietal hematoma).
- Treatment: IV anticoagulation is helpful despite the presence of hemorrhage.

### Primary Intraventricular Hemorrhage

- Rare; investigation for an underlying vascular anomaly is required.
- Bleeding may begin in the periventricular substance and dissect into the ventricle, or arise from periependymal veins.
- Nearly half of patients have identifiable bleeding sources via conventional angiography.

## Laboratory and Imaging Evaluation

- Routine blood chemistries and hematologic studies are necessary.
    - Attention to platelet count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and INR is important for identifying coagulopathy.
- **CT Imaging:** Reliably detects acute focal hemorrhages.
    - Small pontine or medullary hemorrhages may be poorly delineated due to bone artifact.
    - After 2 weeks, clotted blood attenuation diminishes, becoming isodense.
    - A surrounding rim of contrast enhancement may appear after 2–4 weeks and persist for months.
- **MRI:** More sensitive for posterior fossa lesions, though usually unnecessary for primary diagnosis.
    - Images of flowing blood may identify AVMs.
- **CTA or Postcontrast CT:** May reveal a **“spot sign”** (small areas of enhancement within a hematoma).
    - The spot sign represents ongoing bleeding and is associated with increased risk of hematoma expansion, mortality, and poor outcome.
- **Angiography (MRI, CTA, conventional x-ray):** Used when the cause is uncertain, especially in young or nonhypertensive patients, or if the hematoma is not in a usual site for hypertensive hemorrhage.
- **Lumbar puncture** is generally unnecessary and should be avoided due to the risk of inducing cerebral herniation, as patients often have focal signs and signs of increased ICP.

# Intracerebral Hemorrhage Treatment

## Acute Management

- Focus shifts to medical and surgical management after addressing BP and airway.
- The **ICH Score** is a validated clinical grading scale used for stratifying mortality risk, but it should not be used to precisely prognosticate outcome.

### Reversal of Coagulopathy

- Coagulopathy must be corrected rapidly.
- **Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs):** Rapid correction achieved by infusing **prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs)** with concurrent Vitamin K.
    - Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is an alternative but is not recommended if PCC is available, due to larger fluid volumes and longer time required.
- **Dabigatran:** Reversed quickly by **idarucizumab** (monoclonal antibody).
- **Oral Xa Inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban):** Can be reversed with **andexanet alfa**.
    - PCC may partially reverse their effects and is reasonable if andexanet alfa is unavailable.
- **Thrombocytopenia:** If platelet count is <50,000/$\mu$L, transfusion of fresh platelets is indicated.
    - Platelet transfusions in patients taking antiplatelet drugs without thrombocytopenia showed no benefit and possible harm.
- Recombinant factor VIIa reduced hematoma expansion but did not improve clinical outcomes and is not recommended.
- Tranexamic acid administration did not alter outcome in a large trial.

### Management of Intracranial Pressure (ICP)

- ICP is often normal even with large ICHs.
- If hematoma causes marked midline shift, obtundation, coma, or hydrocephalus, osmotic agents should be started.
    - This is in preparation for placement of a ventriculostomy or parenchymal ICP monitor.
- Once ICP is recorded, CPP (MAP minus ICP) should be maintained at least **50–70 mmHg** using CSF drainage, osmotic therapy, and BP management.
- Induced **hyperventilation** should be limited to acute resuscitation and eliminated once other treatments are instituted, as it may cause ischemia.
- Glucocorticoids are not helpful for edema from intracerebral hematoma.

### Surgical Management

- **Supratentorial Hematomas (Basal Ganglia/Lobar):** Routine surgical evacuation does not appear to improve outcome for most patients.
    - STICH trials found no benefit for early surgical evacuation versus initial medical management.
    - Surgery might have a role in select, severely affected patients with lobar supratentorial hemorrhage (STICH-II).
    - Surgery is often considered for patients deemed salvageable who are experiencing progressive neurologic deterioration due to herniation.
    - Minimally invasive endoscopic evacuation followed by thrombolysis has not been shown to improve outcome.
- **Cerebellar Hematomas:** A neurosurgeon should be consulted immediately.
    - Most cerebellar hematomas **>3 cm in diameter** require surgical evacuation.
    - If the patient is alert, lacks focal brainstem signs, and the hematoma is <1 cm, removal is usually unnecessary.
    - Hematomas between 1 and 3 cm require careful observation for deterioration.
    - Hydrocephalus requires surgical evacuation of the hematoma.

## Recovery and Prevention

- Major improvement commonly occurs in survivors as the hematoma is reabsorbed and adjacent displaced tissue regains function.
- **Prevention** is aimed at:
    - Reducing chronic hypertension (leading cause of primary ICH).
    - Eliminating excessive alcohol use.
    - Discontinuing illicit drugs (cocaine, amphetamines).
- Patients with CAA should generally avoid oral anticoagulant medications. Antiplatelet agents may be administered if indicated for atherothrombotic vascular disease.

# Vascular Anomalies

## Congenital Vascular Malformations

### True Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs)

- Congenital shunts between arterial and venous systems.
- Consist of a tangle of abnormal, thin vessels (nidus).
- Vary widely in size and occur in all parts of the CNS. Largest ones are often in the posterior half of the hemispheres.
- **Presentation:** Bleeding, headache, and seizures are most common between ages 10 and 30 (sometimes as late as the fifties).
- **Clinical Features:**
    - One-half become evident as ICHs, which are mainly intraparenchymal.
    - Unlike SAH from aneurysms, blood is usually not deposited in the basal cisterns, and symptomatic cerebral vasospasm is rare.
    - Headache (without bleeding) may be hemicranial and throbbing (migraine-like) or diffuse.
    - Focal seizures (with or without generalization) occur in $\sim 30%$ of cases.
- **Hemorrhage Risk:** Strongly influenced by prior rupture.
    - Unruptured AVMs: $\sim 2–4%$ per year.
    - Previously ruptured AVMs: May be as high as $17%$ a year for the first year.
- **Large AVMs:** May steal blood from adjacent tissue or increase venous pressure, causing venous ischemia.
    - May be associated with a systolic and diastolic bruit over the eye/neck and a bounding carotid pulse.
- **Diagnosis:** MRI is better than CT. Conventional x-ray angiography is the gold standard for anatomical evaluation.
- **Treatment:**
    - Surgical treatment, often with preoperative embolization, is usually indicated for accessible lesions that have bled.
    - Stereotactic radiosurgery causes slow sclerosis over 2–3 years.
    - Smaller lesions, deep venous drainage, venous outflow stenosis, and intranidal aneurysms may increase rupture risk.
    - **Unruptured AVMs:** The ARUBA trial found that intervention (surgery, embolization, or radiosurgery) resulted in significantly higher risk of death or symptomatic stroke (31%) compared to medical management (10%).

### Venous Anomalies

- Result from anomalous cerebral, cerebellar, or brainstem venous drainage.
- These are functional venous channels and are usually of little clinical significance.
- Surgical resection may result in venous infarction and hemorrhage.
- May be associated with cavernous malformations.

### Capillary Telangiectasias

- True capillary malformations, often forming extensive networks in otherwise normal brain tissue.
- Typical locations: pons and deep cerebral white matter.
- If bleeding occurs, it rarely produces mass effect or significant symptoms.
- No treatment options exist.
- Can be seen in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Rendu-Weber) syndrome.

## Acquired Vascular Lesions

### Cavernous Angiomas (Cavernous Malformations)

- Tufts of capillary sinusoids within deep hemispheric white matter and brainstem, lacking normal intervening neural structures.
- Typically <1 cm in diameter, often associated with a venous anomaly.
- **Bleeding Risk:** Small volume bleeding usually occurs.
    - Single malformations: $0.7–1.5%$ per year. Higher for patients with prior clinical hemorrhage or multiple malformations.
- Seizures may occur if near the cerebral cortex.
- **Treatment:**
    - Surgical resection eliminates bleeding risk and may reduce seizure risk. Usually reserved for malformations near the brain surface.
    - Radiation treatment has not been shown to be beneficial.
    - Intracranial hemorrhage risk is likely not increased by antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications prescribed for other conditions.

### Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas

- Acquired connections, usually from a dural artery to a dural sinus.
- Patients may complain of a **pulse-synchronous cephalic bruit** (“pulsatile tinnitus”) and headache.
- High venous pressures can cause cortical ischemia or venous hypertension and hemorrhage (particularly SAH).
- Surgical and endovascular techniques are usually curative.
- Association exists between fistulas and dural sinus thrombosis.

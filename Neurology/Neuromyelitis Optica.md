# INTRODUCTION

- **Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO; Devic’s disease)** is an aggressive inflammatory disorder characterized by **recurrent attacks of optic neuritis (ON) and myelitis**.
- **NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD)** is a more inclusive term for individuals with partial forms or involvement of additional CNS regions.
- NMO is **more frequent in women than men (9:1)** and typically begins in adulthood, with a mean onset age of 40 years.
- **Distinguishing NMO from multiple sclerosis (MS)** is important, especially early in presentation.
    - **ON in NMO** can be **bilateral and cause severe visual loss** (uncommon in MS).
    - **Myelitis in NMO** can be severe and **transverse** (rare in MS), typically **longitudinally extensive** (involving three or more contiguous vertebral segments) [1, 3A].
    - **Progressive symptoms typically do not occur in NMO**, in contrast to MS.
- **Brain MRI findings in NMO**:
    - Often shows **brain lesions**, including nonspecific signal change.
    - Lesions can be associated with specific syndromes:
        - Hypothalamus: causing an endocrinopathy.
        - Area postrema (lower medulla): presenting as intractable hiccups or vomiting [1, 3E, 3F].
        - Cerebral hemispheres: producing focal symptoms, encephalopathy, or seizures.
    - **Large cerebral hemisphere lesions** can be asymptomatic, sometimes "cloudlike," and **often resolve completely** unlike MS lesions.
- **Spinal cord MRI lesions**: Typically consist of **focal enhancing areas of swelling and tissue destruction**, extending over **three or more spinal cord segments** [1, 3A, 3B]. On axial sequences, these are centered on the grey matter.
- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings**:
    - **Pleocytosis greater than observed in MS**, with neutrophils and eosinophils often present in acute cases.
    - **Oligoclonal bands (OCBs) are uncommon**, found in less than 20% of NMO patients.
- **Pathology of NMO**:
    - **Distinctive astrocytopathy** with inflammation and loss of astrocytes.
    - Absence of AQP4 water channel protein staining by immunohistochemistry.
    - Thickened blood vessel walls, demyelination, and deposition of antibody and complement.

# IMMUNOLOGY

- NMO is an **autoimmune disease**.
- Associated with a **highly specific autoantibody against aquaporin-4 (AQP-4)**, present in **~90% of NMO patients**.
- AQP-4 localization: Foot processes of astrocytes (close to endothelial surfaces) and paranodal regions near nodes of Ranvier.
- **AQP-4 antibodies are likely pathogenic**: passive transfer into laboratory animals reproduces histologic features.
- **Antibody-mediated complement fixation** is thought to be the **primary mechanism of astrocyte injury**.
- During acute myelitis attacks, CSF levels of:
    - **Interleukin-6 (IL-6)** (proinflammatory cytokine) are markedly elevated.
    - **Astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)** are markedly elevated.
    - These elevations are consistent with active inflammation and astrocyte injury.
- **Proinflammatory T-lymphocytes (Th17 type)** recognizing an AQP4 epitope may also contribute to pathogenesis.
- **Presence of AQP4 antibody is considered diagnostic** when combined with a typical clinical presentation due to its high specificity.
- **Anti-AQP4 seropositive patients** have a **high risk for future relapses**; over half of untreated patients relapse within 1 year.

# CLINICAL COURSE

- NMO is typically a **recurrent disease**; a monophasic course occurs in less than 10% of patients.
- Individuals negative for AQP4 antibodies are somewhat more likely to have a monophasic course.
- **Untreated NMO is usually quite disabling over time**.
    - In one series, **respiratory failure from cervical myelitis** was in one-third of patients.
    - Eight years after onset, **60% of patients were blind** and over half had permanent paralysis of one or more limbs.
- **Long-term course has substantially improved** with therapies for acute attacks and relapse prevention.
- **Estimates of 5-year survival rate increased from 68–75% (1999) to 91–98% (2017)**, likely due to improved diagnosis and widespread immunosuppressant use.

# GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS

- Incidence and prevalence of NMO vary considerably across populations and regions, with estimates ranging from <1 to >4 per 100,000.
- Can occur in any ethnic background, but **disproportionately affects individuals of Asian and African origin**.
- **Highest reported prevalence is from Martinique**.
- Among white populations, MS is far more common than NMO.
- When MS affects individuals of African or Asian ancestry, there's a propensity for demyelinating lesions to predominantly involve the **optic nerve and spinal cord** (opticospinal MS).
    - Some individuals with opticospinal MS are **seropositive for AQP4 antibodies**, indicating these cases are NMOSD.

# ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS

- Up to **40% of NMO patients have a systemic autoimmune disorder**.
    - Examples: systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, p-ANCA–associated vasculitis, myasthenia gravis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, mixed connective tissue disease.
- This is a distinct feature from MS; MS patients rarely have other comorbid autoimmune diseases, except for hypothyroidism.
- In some NMO cases, onset may be associated with **acute infection** (e.g., varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, tuberculosis).
- Rare cases are **paraneoplastic**, associated with breast, lung, or other cancers.

# TREATMENT

- **Acute attacks**:
    - Usually treated with **high-dose glucocorticoids** (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 g/d for 5–10 days, followed by prednisone taper).
    - **Plasma exchange** (typically 5–7 exchanges of 1.5 plasma volumes/exchange) is used empirically for episodes unresponsive to glucocorticoids.
- **Prophylaxis against relapses is recommended for most patients** due to the unfavorable natural history of untreated NMO.
    - Common empiric regimens include:
        - Mycophenolate mofetil (1000 mg bid).
        - B-cell depleting anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody **rituximab** (2 g IV Q 6 months).
        - Combination of **glucocorticoids** (500 mg IV methylprednisolone daily for 5 days, then oral prednisone 1 mg/kg per day for 2 months, slow taper) **plus azathioprine** (2 mg/kg per day started on week 3).
- **Important distinction from MS therapies**:
    - Some MS-effective therapies are **not useful for NMO**.
    - Interferon beta is ineffective and may increase NMO relapse risk.
    - Glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, natalizumab, and alemtuzumab also appear ineffective based on limited data.
    - These differences **highlight the importance of distinguishing NMO from MS**.
- **Three monoclonal antibody therapies have regulatory approval for attack prevention in NMO**:
    - **Eculizumab**:
        - **Terminal complement inhibitor** (binds to C5, inhibits cleavage, prevents C5b-9 complex generation).
        - Investigated as add-on therapy in AQP4 seropositive NMO.
        - **Lengthened time to first attack by 94%**.
        - **Reduced attack rate by 96%**.
        - Reduced hospitalizations, glucocorticoid, and plasma exchange use.
        - Dosing: 900 mg weekly for 4 weeks, then 1200 mg for 5th dose 1 week later, then 1200 mg every 2 weeks.
        - Available through a **Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)** due to **life-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections**.
        - Patients **must be immunized with meningococcal vaccines** at least 2 weeks prior to first dose, unless risk of delaying therapy outweighs infection risk.
        - Vaccination reduces but does not eliminate infection risk.
        - All patients must be monitored for early signs of meningococcal infections.
    - **Inebilizumab**:
        - **Humanized monoclonal antibody binding to B-cell-specific surface antigen CD19**.
        - Depletes a wide range of B cells, including plasmablasts and some plasma cells.
        - As monotherapy, **reduced time to first NMO attack by 77%** compared to placebo.
        - Reduced hospitalizations by 78%, disability worsening by 63%, and new MRI lesions by 43%.
        - Dosing: 300 mg IV infusion, second 300 mg IV infusion 2 weeks later, then 300 mg infusions every 6 months.
        - Associated with **dose-dependent decline in serum IgG levels** and **neutropenia**.
    - **Satralizumab**:
        - **Monoclonal antibody that binds to the interleukin-6 receptor**, blocking IL-6 engagement.
        - Investigated in two NMOSD trials (monotherapy and add-on).
        - Enrolled both AQP4 seropositive and seronegative participants.
        - Time to first attack was longer with satralizumab in both studies.
        - **Risk of attack reduced by 74% in monotherapy study, and 78% in add-on study**.
        - **No clinically meaningful impact in AQP4 seronegative participants**.
        - Administration: 120 mg subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 2, 4 (loading); then 120 mg every 4 weeks (maintenance).
        - **Screening for hepatitis B virus, tuberculosis, and liver transaminase elevations required before starting**.
        - Hepatic transaminases and CBC (for neutropenia) should be monitored during treatment.
        - Associated with **weight gain**.

# MYELIN OLIGODENDROCYTE GLYCOPROTEIN-ANTIBODY-ASSOCIATED DISEASE (MOGAD)

- **Anti-MOG antibodies** detected by cell-based assay are associated with:
    - Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children.
    - AQP4 seronegative NMO cases.
- Patients seropositive for anti-MOG antibodies are at risk for **bilateral, synchronous optic neuritis and myelitis**.
- **Distinguishing MOGAD ON from NMO or MS**: Presence of **papillitis** (seen by funduscopy or orbital MRI).
- **MRI findings in MOGAD**:
    - ON is typically **longitudinally extensive**.
    - Brain MRI can be normal or show "fluffy" areas of increased signal change in white or grey matter, similar to NMO.
    - MS-typical lesions (e.g., Dawson fingers, T1-hypointense lesions) are uncommon.
    - Spinal cord lesions can be longitudinally extensive or short, sometimes involving the conus medullaris.
- **Clinical Course**: Demyelination can be **monophasic** (like ADEM) or **recurrent**.
- **CSF findings**: May show pleocytosis with occasional neutrophils.
    - Elevated intrathecal synthesis of gammaglobulins is atypical.
    - Oligoclonal bands are present in ~6–13% of cases.
    - Intrathecal synthesis of anti-MOG antibodies does not occur.
- **Mechanism of CNS injury in MOGAD is not established**.
- **Acute episodes management**:
    - High-dose glucocorticoids followed by prednisone taper.
    - Sometimes plasmapheresis, similar to NMO.
    - Brain lesions often **respond rapidly to glucocorticoids and may resolve entirely**.
    - Some patients experience recurrence after prednisone discontinuation and can become glucocorticoid dependent.
- **Long-term treatment**:
    - Clinical trials have not been undertaken; limited data on other immune-suppressing medications used in NMO.
    - **Off-label empiric treatments include daily prednisone, IVIg, rituximab, and mycophenolate mofetil**.
- Anti-MOG antibody titers appear to decline spontaneously or with treatment.
- Rare cases of relapsing optic nerve and spinal cord disease resembling NMOSD have been recognized with **autoantibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)**, an astrocyte-specific protein. This disorder more commonly presents as meningoencephalitis resembling ADEM.

- functional bowel disorder
- Abdominal pain, discomfort, altered bowel habits in the absence of structural defects
- Diagnosis depends on clinical presentation
- Rome IV latest criteria
	- Recurrent abdominal pain on average 1/week for past 3 months with >_2 
		- Related to defecation
		- Associated with changed frequency of stool 
		- Change in form of stool 
	- Criteria fulfilled in last 3 months but symptoms onset atleast 6 months before diagnosis
- Symptoms on off and associated with functional disorders like 
	- Fibromyalgia
	- Headache
	- Backache
	- Genitourinary symptoms
# clinical features
- all ages but first symptom usually<45 
- Women 2x diagnosed
- Pain should be associated with defecation or onset associated with changed in frequency or form 
- Discomfort is no longer a criteria 
- Painless diarrhea or constipation is not IBS 
## abdominal pain
- Prerequisites
- Episodic and crampy 
- Superimposed on background of ache 
- Ignored or may interfere with daily activities
- Malnutrition is rare 
- Sleep deprivation rare as pain in daytime 
- Exacerbated by eating or emotional stress and improved by flatus or stool passage 
- May worsen in menstrual or premenstrual phase 
## altered bowel habits 
- altered bowel habits consistent feature
- Constipation alternating with diarrhea and one of them predominant
- Initially constipation is eisodic but later refractory to laxatives 
- Hard stool with narrow calibre due to excessive dehydration due to colonic spasm and retention
- Incomplete evacuation
- Diarrhea usually small volume <200ml 
- No nocturnal diarrhea but maybe aggravated by stress or eating
- Bleeding does not happen unless hemorrhoids
- Subtypes of predominance may change 

## gas and flatulence
- Abdominal distention, increased belching or flatulence 
- Gas is normal level but attributed to gas 
- Impaired tolerance and transit of gas load
- Reflux of gas from distal to proximal intestine causing belching 
## upper GI symptoms
-  dyspepsia, nausea, heartburn, vomiting
- High abnormalities in waking up period but nocturnal normal 
- Dyspepsia IBS overlap is great 
- Functional dyspepsia and IBS maybe manifestation of same extensive GI tract disorder
# Pathophysiology 
## GI motor abnormalities
- Unstimulated conditions normal 
- Under stimulated condition, motor abnormalities present 
- Increased rectosigmoid activity upto 3h after eating  
- Transverse descending and sigmoid colon have ***High motility index and peak amplitude of HAPCs*** (high amplitude propagating contractions)
## visceral hypersensitivity
- exaggerated sensory response to visceral stimulation 
- Food intolerance 2x more common than general population
- ***Prolonged fasting improves symptoms***
- Visceral afferent dysfunction produce pain at lower distension pressure (***only visceral with somatic sparing)***
- ***Lipids lower the threshold*** for gas, discomfort and pain sensation in IBS 
- Increased sensitivity only in gut not in other parts
## CNS dysregulation 
- Associated with emotional disorders and stress 
- ***Mid-cingulate cortex*** (attention and response selection) activated more in IBS patients 
- Preferential activation of ***prefrontal lobe*** involved with more alertness 
## Abnormal psychology
- in 80% 
- Exaggerated response to visceral stimulation persists even after excluding psychological factors 
- Influence pain threshold
- Abuse is associated with more pain reporting, distress and poor outcome
- Greater Activation of affect processing area (***posterior and middle dorsal cingulate gyrus***)
## Postinfectious IBS 
- gi infection predisposes 
- More in females and younger 
- Risk factors
	- Prolonged duration of illness
	- Toxicity of bacterial strains - Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella 
	- Smoking
	- Mucosal markers 
	- Female 
	- Depression
	- Hypochondriac 
	- Adverse events in previous 3 month's 
	- Antibiotic use 
## Immunr activation and Mucosal Inflammation
- Persistent low grade Inflammation with activated lymphos, mast cells, proinflammatory cytokines 
- IL 6, 1B TNF 
- Abnormal epithelial secretion and visceral hypersensitivity 
- Mast cell activation in colonic mucosa -- proximity to submucosal nerve fibres correlate to frequency and severity of pain
- TRP (Transient receptor potential channels) like TRPV1 Vanilloid receptor initiates and maintaining visceral hypersensitivity
- increased TRPV1 expression in enteric nervous system 
- Increased intestinal permeability
- Higher FBDSI score (functional bowel disorder severity index) 

## altered gut flora 
- small intestinal Bacterial overgrowth prevalence is plus minus on studies 
- Abnormal H2 breath test (false positive) due to rapid small bowel transit 
- Increase ratio of fecal Firmicutes to bacteroides
- Diversity of microbiome reduced
- Increased instability of gut flora 
- Decreased Bifidobacterium and Feacalibacterium (butyrate producing and anti-inflammatory) 
- Higher enterobacteriacae (proteobacteria causes lipopolysaccharide induced mucosal inflammation ), Lactobacillacae and Bacteroides 
## Altered Serotonin Pathway 
- serotonin-containing enterochromaffin cells in the colon are increased in IBS-D 
- higher postprandial serotonin 
- functional TPH1 (tryptophan hydroxylase rate limiting step) polymorphism 
- gut microbes promote colonic serotonin production 
- downregulation of SERT expression (mucosal serotonin reuptake transport )
# Approach 
- no pathognomic abnormalities 
- relies on symptoms and excluding organic causes 
- ROME IV criteria 
- do not consider if 
	- first presentation in old age 
	- progressive course 
	- persistent diarrhea after 48h fast 
	- nocturnal diarrhea 
- do from harrison 
# Treatment 
## Patient counselling and Diet 
- avoid obvious precipitants 
- meticulously diet history for coffee, disaccharide , legumes, cabbage 
- fructose , sorbitol , mannitol 
- elimination trial 
- low FODMAPs diet 
## Stool bulking agent 
- high fiber diet 
- bulk by bran or hydrophillic colloid 
- slow transit time in diarrhea  (increases normally )
- binds water so avoid excess hydration or dehydration of stool 
- fiber improves visceral afferent function 
- may produce variable results 
- poor response in diarrhea predominant or pain predominant IBS 
- start at low dose and titrate to 20-30g/day over weeks 
## Antispasmodics 
- anticholinergic drugs for painful cramps 
- inhibit gastrocolic reflex so best given 30min before meals 
- most contain belladona alkaloids , side effects 
	- xerostomia
	- urinary hesitancy and retention 
	- blurred vision 
	- drowsiness 
	- avoid in elderly 
- synthetics like dicyclomine have less side effects 
- peppermint oil helps but mechanism unknown 
## Anti-diarrheal 
- ***peripheral acting opiate based agents initial therapy of choice*** for IBS-D
- in severe diarrhea , painless especially 
	- loperamide 
	- 2-4mg every 4-6h 
	- upto 12mg/day 
	- less addictive 
	- effective when taken before anticipated stress events 
- intestines do not become tolerant to effect of opiods so increasing doses usually not required 
- cholestyramine also useful 
## Antidepressants 
- TCAs (imipramine) in IBS-D 
	- slows jejunal MMCs 
	- delays gut transit 
	- motor inhibitory effect 
- no improve in IBS-C patients 
- effect independent of treating depression 
- SSRIs (paroxetine) increase orocecal transit so maybe useful in IBS-C
- Citalopram (SSRI) limited effect in reducing pain 
## Anti-flatulence 
- gas management rarely satisfactory 
- avoid chewing gum or carbonated beverages 
- eat slowly 
- bloating may improve with IBS or constipation treatment 
- dietary exclusion trial if 
	- If bloating is accompanied by diarrhea 
	- and worsens after ingesting dairy products, fresh fruits, vegetables, or juices
- low FODMAP 
- Simethicone usefulness doubtful 
- Beano (oral beta-glycosidase ) reduces rectal gas passage 
- Pancreatic enzymes 
## Serotonin Receptor modulators 
- 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 in GI 
- Prucalopride 
	- dihydrobenzo-furancarboxamide derivative, is 
	- a new selective agonist of 5-HT4.
	- chronic constipation 
	- side effects of headache nausea diarrhea 
	- no CVS side effects  (present with 5-HT4 agonist Tegaserod)
- Tegaserod 
	- 5-HT4 agonist 
	- prokinetics 
	- improve constipation and bloating 
	- voluntary withdrawal due to CVS side effects 
## Secretagogue 
- Lubiprostone, linaclotide, and plecanatide 
- net efflux of ions and water into intestinal lumen 
- increase chloride secretion by apical surface channel activation which also causes Na secretion and h20 secretion 
- Lubiprostone 
	- bicyclic fatty acid derivative of PGE1 
	- type 3 Cl channel activation 
	- oral 24mg bd 
	- IBS-C 
- Linaclotide and plecanatide 
	- minimally absorbed 
	- 14 AA peptide Guanylate cyclase-C agonist (GC-C)
	- activate GC-C on luminal surface 
	- activation of CFTR and fluid secretion 
	- IBS-C 
- Tenapanor GI Na-H exchange -3 inhibition 50mg BD 
## Osmotic laxative 
- osmotics
	- magnesium citrate based 
	- sodium phosphate based (hyperphosphatemia , hypocalcemia, hypokalemia )
	- non absorbable carbs 
- PEG (polyethylene glycol) is isotonic and causes high volume lavage 
- MgOH may cause hypermagnesemia in renal impaired 
## Modulate gut flora 
- antibiotics 
	- neomycin 500 BD for 10 days 
	- Rifaximin 550 BD 2 weeks for global symptoms and bloating 
- Prebiotics 
	- non digestible food ingredients 
	- stimulate bacterial growth or activity 
	- worsened or did not improve in 3/4 studies 
- Probiotics 
	- live microbes 
	- significant pain and bloating relief 
	- bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus 
	- no change in stool frequency or consistency 
- Low FODMAP Diet 
	- FODMAP triggers symptoms 
	- poor absorbable and high fermentation 
	- growth of gram negative commensals 
	- low FODMAP reduces symptoms 
	- many recommended as first line therapy

- depends on which phase affected
    - Luminal Digestion (initiate in lingual and gastric lipase and continue with action of pancreatic enzymes and bile salt )
    - Small intestinal mucosal digestion
        - enterocyte brush border enzymes
        - Disaccharidases, enterokinases, peptidases
        - Digest on contact
        - Mixed micelles with lipid and bile salt 
    - Post mucosal absorption
        - reprocessing
        - Enter into lymphatic as long-chain TGs in chylomicrons
        - bloodstream transport

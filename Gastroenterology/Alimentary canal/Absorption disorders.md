- depends on which phase affected
    - Luminal Digestion (initiate in lingual and gastric lipase and continue with action of pancreatic enzymes and bile salt )
    - Small intestinal mucosal digestion
        - enterocyte brush border enzymes
        - Disaccharidases, enterokinases, peptidases
        - Digest on contact
        - Mixed micelles with lipid and bile salt 
    - Post mucosal absorption
        - reprocessing
        - Enter into lymphatic as long-chain TGs in chylomicrons
        - bloodstream transport
- ![[Malabsorption-class.PNG]]
- Diverse presentation
    - lactase deficiency causes diarrhea in lactose 
    - Celiac sprue may present with iron deficiency or multiple nutrient deficiencies
- Diarrhea
    - most common symptom of malabsorption
    - 72 hour fecal fat is best to define Steatorrhea
    - Steatorrhea is stool fat >7% of dietary fat 
# Nutrient digestion and absorption
- surface area of small intestine (6-12Ft long) increased by folds, villi, microvilli
- Intense has 7-9L fluid daily with stool volume <200g or ML per day 
## Lipids 
- hydrolysis by pancreatic enzymes and bile salts for dispersion
- Absorbed as micelle by intestine
- Bile acids 
    - synthesis by liver and secreted to Intestinal lumne 
    - Constant reabsorption
    - FGF 19 is physiological sensor 
    - FGF 19 by ileum into bloodstream and reduces hepatic bile acid synthesis by blocking CYP7A1 
- Lipolysis intitiated by gastric lipases and long chain TGs (>12C) are hydrolysed by pancreatic lipase to fatty acid and monoglyceride 
- Long chain FFAs dispersed by bile salts to ***Micelles*** which permits ***absorption across apical brush border*** 
- Medium and short chain FFAs soluble in water layer 
- Long chain FFAs re-esterified to tgs in enterocyte 
- and packed into ***chylomicrons*** with apolipoprotein on surface, secreted into ECF and because of size enter lymphatic and not capillary
- medium TGs absorbed intact directly so no pancreatic lipolysis or micelle needed 
- Small TGs made and absorbed in colon 
## Carbohydrate
- final digested products are glucose fructose galactose
- Transported to enterocyte by SLCA5 (earlier SGLT1), Na dependent and GLUT-5 for fructose by facilitated diffusion
- Exit the cell by GLUT-2
## protein
- starts in stomach by pepsin 
- Pancreatic endopeptidase exopeptidase and trypsin
- Trypsinogen to trypsin by enterokinases 
- Trypsin activates chymotrypsin proelastase and carboxypeptidase a and b 
- Large peptides to dipeptide tripeptide of free amino acids at brush border
- All converted to amino acids which go to bloodstream via basolateral membrane
# Luminal phase 
- starts at mouth, continues in stomach and into bowel 
- Disorders due to 
    - gastric or intestinal motility like Surgery, scleroderma, DM 
    - Pancreatic disease
    - Luminal bile salt deficiency by heptobiliary disease, ileal disease or small bowel bacterial overgrowth
- Gastric resection
    - remove or bypass part of stomach and duodenal bulb like roux-en-Y or Bilroth 2 
    - Diarrhea and weight loss
    - Inadequate mixing of contents with enzyme and bile salts 
- Disordered motility
    - hyperthyroidism due to increased motility
    - Long-standing DM due to enteric nervous system defects causing increased motility
    - Scleroderma etc may reduce motility
- Pancreatic insufficiency
    - chronic pancreatitis
    - All nutrients malabsorption
    - Steatorrhea with high volume, bulk and malodorous
    - Fat soluble vitamins deficiency
    - Weight loss 
- Bile salt deficiency
    - Heptobiliary disease
        - decreased synthesis or reduced secretion into gut lumen (PSC or PBC)
    - Ileal resection
        - reduced recycling of bile acids by enterohepatic circulation
        - Increased entry and concentration in colon causing ***secretory diarrhea***
        - Malabsorption due to inadequate concentration in lumen 
        - <100cm resection causes spillage into colon
        - >100cm resection causes loss of bile acids and malabsorption is predominant 
        - Crohn's
    - Bile acid diarrhea
        - functional diarrhea or IBS 
        - Reduced FGF-19 by ileal enterocyte
        - Bile acid sequestrants are treatment
    - Small bowel bacterial overgrowth
        - bacterial titres increase from duodenum to ileum normally
        - If motility affected or Stasis, bacterial overgrowth maybe seen 
        - like 
            - scleroderma
            - Pseudoobstruction chronic
            - Blind loop like Bilroth 2
            - Stricture
            - Crohn's fibrosis 
            - Diffuse diverticulitis
            - Resection of ileocecal valve increases counts from colon 
            - Diarrhea predominant IBS
        - Deconjugate bile acids, increasing absorption and reducing intraluminal concentration
        - Carbohydrate malabsorption and short chain FFAs production causing diarrhea and gas 
        - B12 deficiency due to bacterial metabolism of B12 leading to macrocytic Anemia
		- ***Elevated folate*** from bacterial folate systems
		- Diagnosis
			- Duodenal aspirates for bacterial titres is gold standard
			- Breath hydrogen test with lactulose
			- May treat empirically
		- Treatment
			- Surgical correction of blind loop
			- Endoscopic stricture dilation
			- Remove large diverticula 
			- Treat underlying
			- Rifaximin nonabsorbable antibiotic
			- others like metronidazole, doxicycline , Amoxicillin-clavulinic acid or cephalosporin for several weeks
# mucosal phase 
- mediated by enterocyte brush border enzymes
## enterocyte carbohydrate transporter defects and enzyme deficiency
- Lactose intolerance
	- Lactase deficiency
	- Most common
	- Diarrhoea, pain, gassines, bloating
	- Dairy products and other hidden sources 
	- Primary genetic -- adult type hypolactasia 
	- Secondary
	    - infection 
	    - Mucosal diseases
	- Congenital is rare and AR 
	- Adult type 
    	- very common
    	- Genetic wild type 
    	- Lack the "persistence" allele
    - Diarrhea
        - lactose in lumen acts as osmotic
        - Draws fluid into lumen
        - Gut bacteria ferment lactose producing gas

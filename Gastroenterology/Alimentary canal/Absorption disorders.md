- depends on which phase affected
    - Luminal Digestion (initiate in lingual and gastric lipase and continue with action of pancreatic enzymes and bile salt )
    - Small intestinal mucosal digestion
        - enterocyte brush border enzymes
        - Disaccharidases, enterokinases, peptidases
        - Digest on contact
        - Mixed micelles with lipid and bile salt 
    - Post mucosal absorption
        - reprocessing
        - Enter into lymphatic as long-chain TGs in chylomicrons
        - bloodstream transport
- ![[Malabsorption-class.PNG]]
- Diverse presentation
    - lactase deficiency causes diarrhea in lactose 
    - Celiac sprue may present with iron deficiency or multiple nutrient deficiencies
- Diarrhea
    - most common symptom of malabsorption
    - 72 hour fecal fat is best to define Steatorrhea
    - Steatorrhea is stool fat >7% of dietary fat 
# Nutrient digestion and absorption
- surface area of small intestine (6-12Ft long) increased by folds, villi, microvilli
- Intense has 7-9L fluid daily with stool volume <200g or ML per day 
## Lipids 
- hydrolysis by pancreatic enzymes and bile salts for dispersion
- Absorbed as micelle by intestine
- Bile acids 
    - synthesis by liver and secreted to Intestinal lumne 
    - Constant reabsorption
    - FGF 19 is physiological sensor 
    - FGF 19 by ileum into bloodstream and reduces hepatic bile acid synthesis by blocking CYP7A1 
- Lipolysis intitiated by gastric lipases and long chain TGs (>12C) are hydrolysed by pancreatic lipase to fatty acid and monoglyceride 
- Long chain FFAs dispersed by bile salts to ***Micelles*** which permits ***absorption across apical brush border*** 
- Medium and short chain FFAs soluble in water layer 
- Long chain FFAs re-esterified to tgs in enterocyte 
- and packed into ***chylomicrons*** with apolipoprotein on surface, secreted into ECF and because of size enter lymphatic and not capillary
- medium TGs absorbed intact directly so no pancreatic lipolysis or micelle needed 
- Small TGs made and absorbed in colon 
## Carbohydrate
- final digested products are glucose fructose galactose
- Transported to enterocyte by SLCA5 (earlier SGLT1), Na dependent and GLUT-5 for fructose by facilitated diffusion
- Exit the cell by GLUT-2
## protein
- starts in stomach by pepsin 
- Pancreatic endopeptidase exopeptidase and trypsin
- Trypsinogen to trypsin by enterokinases 
- Trypsin activates chymotrypsin proelastase and carboxypeptidase a and b 
- Large peptides to dipeptide tripeptide of free amino acids at brush border
- All converted to amino acids which go to bloodstream via basolateral membrane
# Luminal phase 
- starts at mouth, continues in stomach and into bowel 
- Disorders due to 
    - gastric or intestinal motility like Surgery, scleroderma, DM 
    - Pancreatic disease
    - Luminal bile salt deficiency by heptobiliary disease, ileal disease or small bowel bacterial overgrowth
- Gastric resection
    - remove or bypass part of stomach and duodenal bulb like roux-en-Y or Bilroth 2 
    - Diarrhea and weight loss
    - Inadequate mixing of contents with enzyme and bile salts 
- Disordered motility
    - hyperthyroidism due to increased motility
    - Long-standing DM due to enteric nervous system defects causing increased motility
    - Scleroderma etc may reduce motility
- Pancreatic insufficiency
    - chronic pancreatitis
    - All nutrients malabsorption
    - Steatorrhea with high volume, bulk and malodorous
    - Fat soluble vitamins deficiency
    - Weight loss 
- Bile salt deficiency
    - Heptobiliary disease
        - decreased synthesis or reduced secretion into gut lumen (PSC or PBC)
    - Ileal resection
        - reduced recycling of bile acids by enterohepatic circulation
        - Increased entry and concentration in colon causing ***secretory diarrhea***
        - Malabsorption due to inadequate concentration in lumen 
        - <100cm resection causes spillage into colon
        - >100cm resection causes loss of bile acids and malabsorption is predominant 
        - Crohn's
    - Bile acid diarrhea
        - functional diarrhea or IBS 
        - Reduced FGF-19 by ileal enterocyte
        - Bile acid sequestrants are treatment
    - Small bowel bacterial overgrowth
        - bacterial titres increase from duodenum to ileum normally
        - If motility affected or Stasis, bacterial overgrowth maybe seen 
        - like 
            - scleroderma
            - Pseudoobstruction chronic
            - Blind loop like Bilroth 2
            - Stricture
            - Crohn's fibrosis 
            - Diffuse diverticulitis
            - Resection of ileocecal valve increases counts from colon 
            - Diarrhea predominant IBS
        - Deconjugate bile acids, increasing absorption and reducing intraluminal concentration
        - Carbohydrate malabsorption and short chain FFAs production causing diarrhea and gas 
        - B12 deficiency due to bacterial metabolism of B12 leading to macrocytic Anemia
		- ***Elevated folate*** from bacterial folate systems
		- Diagnosis
			- Duodenal aspirates for bacterial titres is gold standard
			- Breath hydrogen test with lactulose
			- May treat empirically
		- Treatment
			- Surgical correction of blind loop
			- Endoscopic stricture dilation
			- Remove large diverticula 
			- Treat underlying
			- Rifaximin nonabsorbable antibiotic
			- others like metronidazole, doxicycline , Amoxicillin-clavulinic acid or cephalosporin for several weeks

### Tropical sprue
- poorly understood syndrome
- Chronic diarrhea, weight loss, malabsorption
- Both folate and b12 deficiency
- Malabsorption of 2 unrelated substances required for diagnosis
- 8-20% of those having attack of gastroenteritis in India 
- Maybe a postinfectious complication
- Chronic diarrhea maybe infectious so do not consider unless cysts and trophozoites have been ruled out 
- Environmental enteropathy is a new diagnosis but closely related
- Etiology
	- Since response to antibiotics, likely infectious 
	- Uncertain etiology
	- Uneven distribution in tropics 
	- May develop long after leaving endemic areas
	- Multiple microorganisms implicated but not sure yet, some suggest their toxins maybe the cause 
	- Use of widespread antibiotics for acute diarrhea and better sanitation has reduced prevalence in 2-3 decades 
	- Folate malabsorption seen (absorbed in duodenum and proximal jejunum) 
	- Disease may resolve with folate supplements but unclear how 
- Diagnosis
	- Abnormal intestinal mucosal biopsy with chronic diarrhea
	- Evidence of malabsorption

# Short bowel syndrome
- Intestinal resection for any disorder 
- Children
	- Necrotising enterocolitis
	- Atresia 
	- Volvulus
	- Malrotation 
- ***Extensive removal of small intestine resulting in <200cm remaining small bowel*** 
- ***Intestinal failure is functionally defined as persistent TPN dependence in patients with <100cm bowel and no residual colon*** 
- Clinical
	- Severe diarrhea weight loss malabsorption
	- Multiple nutrients
	- Severity and dependence on TPN
		- Extent of resection
		- Presence of colon in continuity
		- Retention of ileocecal valve
		- Severity of underlying disease
	- Adaptation post resection
		- Crypt cell proliferation increase
		- Epithelial hyperplasia
		- 2 years post resection this continues
	- Massive diarrhea usually in 3 months post operative, with increased gastric acid secretion and malabsorption
	- Gradually increase function and reduced diarrhea
	- Nutrient deficiencies depend on gut segment
    	- ***ileum*** loses B12 and bile salt resorption
    	- Colon causes fluid electrolyte loss and imbalance
- Long term complications
	- fat soluble vitamins deficiency
	- Vitamin D difficult to treat even with high dose supplements orall leading to high osteoporosis risk
	- Frequent renal calcium oxalate stone (calcium saponified, freeing oxalate)
	- Adhesions
- treatment
	- control diarrhea 
	- Normalise nutrition fluid and electrolyte
	- Minimise TPN support
	- Opiates and derivative like loperamide and diphenoxylate-atropine 
	- Acid blocking in ***first year*** PPI or H2 blocker

	- In ***TPN or IV fluids dependent*** patients, ***teduglutide*** a GLP-2 analogue 
- Dietary therapy
	- 3-4x normal caloric intake
	- Early feeding even with TPN
	- If colon in continuity present, low fat diet to minimise secretory diarrhea
	- Highly complex carbohydrates recommend (converted to short chain FFAs and absorbed) 
	- High potency multivitamin
	- TPN
- Monitorin
	- Risk of osteoporosis so monitor with vitamin D and DEXA 
	- Fat soluble vitamins, 
	- B12 folate

- Secondary
	- Retroperitoneal fibrosis
	- Fibrosing mesenteritis 
	- Lymphpoma
- Circulatory causes 
	- Fontan physiology
	- CHF
	- Constrictive pericarditis
## protein losing enteropathy
- group of GI and non-GI isorders
- Hypoproteinemia and Edema in absence of
	- Liver disease with reduced protein synthesis
	- Kidney disease with proteinuria
- Excess protein loss from GI tract 
	- Mucosal ulceration -- exudative loss across mucosa like ulcerative colitis, carcinoma
	- Non-ulcerated damaged mucosa 
		- Loss across epithelial
		- Altered permeability
		- Celiac
		- Menetriers disease 
	- Lymphatic dysfunction
- Diagnosis
	- Diarrhoea, edema and low albumin and globulin
	- in absence of renal and hepatic disease
	- Rarely selective loss of Protein
	- So only albumin loss suggests renal or hepatic dysfunction
	- Only globulin loss suggests reduced synthesis and not more loss 
	- Alpha-1 antitrypsin 
		- Resistance to proteolysis
		- Detects enhanced losses from intestine
		- Cannot detect stomach losses 
		- Spot or 24h stool collection
		- If elevated is diagnostic
		- Clearance can be measured by stool volume and stool and plasma concentration 
	- Peripheral lymphocyte loss leading to ***relative lymphopenia with CD3+ loss*** 
	- Steatorrhea and diarrhea if due to lymphatic
		- Altered lymphatic flow 
		- Lipid containing chylomicrons exit epithelial cells normal 
	- Intestinal lymphangectasia
		- Absence of mechanical or anatomical obstruction
		- Intrinsic intestinal lymphatic dysfunction
		- In 50% with Milroys (intrinsic peripheral lymphatic dysfunction)
		- All functions normal except Steatorrhea and protein loss 
- Endoscopy and imaging
	- Rule out mucosal disease
	- MR enterography in children with lymphangectasia
- Other causes 
	- Cardiac causes 
	- fontan physiology
	- Right sided valvular disease
	- Chronic pericarditis
	- Menetriers disease
- Treatment
	- Direct treatment to detect underlying pathology
	- Critical to establish nature of lymphatic obstruction if any 
	- Mesenteric nodes and lymphoma to be identified
	- Exclude cardiac causes 
	- If congenital heart disease, ***intradonal lymohangiography or non contrast MR lymohangiography***
	- Surgical intervention to decompress lymphatic system 
	- Low fat high protein diet and medium chain TGs 
	- Octreotide a somatostatin analogue

# Approach to suspected malabsorption
- History 
	- Symptoms like diarrhea abdominal pain weight loss 
	- Selective nutrition deficiency like iron, osteoporosis, peripheral neuropathy for b12 hair loss forProtein
	- Predisposing factors like chronic pancreatitis or liver disease like PBC PSC
	- Small bowel resection
	- Outside travel 
- Physical
	- Weight loss by bitemporal wasting
	- Reduced arm circumference
	- Iron deficiency nail spooning
	- B12 neuropathy
- Lab examination
	- Exclusive proximal small intestine iron deficiency
	- Terminal ileum resection B12 deficiency
	- Steatorrhea with fat soluble vitamin deficiencies (PT-inr for vit K )
	- Steatorrhea diagnosis by spot stool for ***Sudan III stain*** specific for fecal fat 
	- 24h stool volume weight assessment
	- 72h fecal fat with 100g fat diet 
	- Stool osmotic gap
		- Fecal sodium potassium 
		- Measurements inaccurate due to bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates
		- 2(stool na +k)
		- 290 is normal serum
		- Gap is 290- stool osmolarity
		- If >50-100 osmotic gap is present and it's osmotic diarrhoea
		- Malabsorption diarrhea may have both Osmotic and secretory component
	- Urinar D-xylose test
		- Carbohydrate malabsorption 
		- Proximal bowel absorption function
		- 25g D-xylose and then 5h urine collection
		- If <4.5g excretion implies duodenal or jejunal mucosal disease
		- Maybe abnormal in 
			- Delayed gastric emptying
			- Impaired motility
			- Renal function impaired
			- 3rd space loss 
		- Intestinal biopsy easier and better 
	- Radiology
		- Small bowel follow-through barium examination for celiac, jejunal diverticulitis for sibo, Crohn's
		- MR enterography and CT enterography for inflammatory stricturing disorders like crohn's and as means to visualise entire gut and hbs 
	- Endoscopy
		- With biopsy
		- Essential in all with Steatorrhea or chronic diarrhea
		- Evaluate abnormalities seen in radiology
		- If Steatorrhea without pancreatic or hepatobiliary disease, endoscopy for biopsy 
		- Enteroscopy using pediatrics colonoscope allows visualisation of jejunum and sometimes ileum 
		- Capsule endoscopy
	- Biopsy
		- Diffuse findings
			- Whipple--  PAS positive macrophages
			- Agammaglobulinemia (common variable immunodeficiency) -- absent or significant reduction in plasma cells in lamina propria 
			- Abetalipoproteinemia lipid postprandial in mucosal cells
		- Patchy lesions

			- Lymphpoma or lymphangectasia
			- Eosinophilic Gastritis
			- Crohn's 
			- Amyloidosis
		- Diffuse non specific
			- villus atrophy in Celiac, tropical sprue, sibo 
			- Multiple microorganisms maybe identified 
			- Candida, aspergillus, cryptococcus or histoplasma on biopsy in immunocompromised suggests systemic infection

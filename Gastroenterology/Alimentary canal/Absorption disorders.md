- depends on which phase affected
    - Luminal Digestion (initiate in lingual and gastric lipase and continue with action of pancreatic enzymes and bile salt )
    - Small intestinal mucosal digestion
        - enterocyte brush border enzymes
        - Disaccharidases, enterokinases, peptidases
        - Digest on contact
        - Mixed micelles with lipid and bile salt 
    - Post mucosal absorption
        - reprocessing
        - Enter into lymphatic as long-chain TGs in chylomicrons
        - bloodstream transport
- ![[Malabsorption-class.PNG]]
- Diverse presentation
    - lactase deficiency causes diarrhea in lactose 
    - Celiac sprue may present with iron deficiency or multiple nutrient deficiencies
- Diarrhea
    - most common symptom of malabsorption
    - 72 hour fecal fat is best to define Steatorrhea
    - Steatorrhea is stool fat >7% of dietary fat 
# Nutrient digestion and absorption
- surface area of small intestine (6-12Ft long) increased by folds, villi, microvilli
- Intense has 7-9L fluid daily with stool volume <200g or ML per day 
## Lipids 
- hydrolo

- depends on which phase affected
    - Luminal Digestion (initiate in lingual and gastric lipase and continue with action of pancreatic enzymes and bile salt )
    - Small intestinal mucosal digestion
        - enterocyte brush border enzymes
        - Disaccharidases, enterokinases, peptidases
        - Digest on contact
        - Mixed micelles with lipid and bile salt 
    - Post mucosal absorption
        - reprocessing
        - Enter into lymphatic as long-chain TGs in chylomicrons
        - bloodstream transport
- ![[Malabsorption-class.PNG]]
- Diverse presentation
    - lactase deficiency causes diarrhea in lactose 
    - Celiac sprue may present with iron deficiency or multiple nutrient deficiencies
- Diarrhea
    - most common symptom of malabsorption
    - 72 hour fecal fat is best to define Steatorrhea
    - Steatorrhea is stool fat >7% of dietary fat 
# Nutrient digestion and absorption
- surface area of small intestine (6-12Ft long) increased by folds, villi, microvilli
- Intense has 7-9L fluid daily with stool volume <200g or ML per day 
## Lipids 
- hydrolysis by pancreatic enzymes and bile salts for dispersion
- Absorbed as micelle by intestine
- Bile acids 
    - synthesis by liver and secreted to Intestinal lumne 
    - Constant reabsorption
    - FGF 19 is physiological sensor 
    - FGF 19 by ileum into bloodstream and reduces hepatic bile acid synthesis by blocking CYP7A1 
- Lipolysis intitiated by gastric lipases and long chain TGs (>12C) are hydrolysed by pancreatic lipase to fatty acid and monoglyceride 
- Long chain FFAs dispersed by bile salts to ***Micelles*** which permits ***absorption across apical brush border*** 
- Medium and short chain FFAs soluble in water layer 
- Long chain FFAs re-esterified to tgs in enterocyte 
- and packed into ***chylomicrons*** with apolipoprotein on surface, secreted into ECF and because of size enter lymphatic and not capillary

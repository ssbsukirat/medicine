- depends on which phase affected
    - Luminal Digestion (initiate in lingual and gastric lipase and continue with action of pancreatic enzymes and bile salt )
    - Small intestinal mucosal digestion
        - enterocyte brush border enzymes
        - Disaccharidases, enterokinases, peptidases
        - Digest on contact
        - Mixed micelles with lipid and bile salt 
    - Post mucosal absorption
        - reprocessing
        - Enter into lymphatic as long-chain TGs in chylomicrons
        - bloodstream transport
- ![[Malabsorption-class.PNG]]
- Diverse presentation
    - lactase deficiency causes diarrhea in lactose 
    - Celiac sprue may present with iron deficiency or multiple nutrient deficiencies
- Diarrhea
    - most common symptom of malabsorption
    - 72 hour fecal fat is best to define Steatorrhea
    - Steatorrhea is stool fat >7% of dietary fat 
# Nutrient digestion and absorption
- surface area of small intestine (6-12Ft long) increased by folds, villi, microvilli
- Intense has 7-9L fluid daily with stool volume <200g or ML per day 
## Lipids 
- hydrolysis by pancreatic enzymes and bile salts for dispersion
- Absorbed as micelle by intestine
- Bile acids 
    - synthesis by liver and secreted to Intestinal lumne 
    - Constant reabsorption
    - FGF 19 is physiological sensor 
    - FGF 19 by ileum into bloodstream and reduces hepatic bile acid synthesis by blocking CYP7A1 
- Lipolysis intitiated by gastric lipases and long chain TGs (>12C) are hydrolysed by pancreatic lipase to fatty acid and monoglyceride 
- Long chain FFAs dispersed by bile salts to ***Micelles*** which permits ***absorption across apical brush border*** 
- Medium and short chain FFAs soluble in water layer 
- Long chain FFAs re-esterified to tgs in enterocyte 
- and packed into ***chylomicrons*** with apolipoprotein on surface, secreted into ECF and because of size enter lymphatic and not capillary
- medium TGs absorbed intact directly so no pancreatic lipolysis or micelle needed 
- Small TGs made and absorbed in colon 
## Carbohydrate
- final digested products are glucose fructose galactose
- Transported to enterocyte by SLCA5 (earlier SGLT1), Na dependent and GLUT-5 for fructose by facilitated diffusion
- Exit the cell by GLUT-2
## protein
- starts in stomach by pepsin 
- Pancreatic endopeptidase exopeptidase and trypsin
- Trypsinogen to trypsin by enterokinases 
- Trypsin activates chymotrypsin proelastase and carboxypeptidase a and b 
- Large peptides to dipeptide tripeptide of free amino acids at brush border
- All converted to amino acids which go to bloodstream via basolateral membrane
# Luminal phase 
- starts at mouth, continues in stomach and into bowel 
- Disorders due to 
    - gastric or intestinal motility like Surgery, scleroderma, DM 
    - Pancreatic disease
    - Luminal bile salt deficiency by heptobiliary disease, ileal disease or small bowel bacterial overgrowth
- Gastric resection
    - remove or bypass part of stomach and duodenal bulb like roux-en-Y or Bilroth 2 
    - Diarrhea and weight loss
    - Inadequate mixing of contents with enzyme and bile salts 
- Disordered motility
    - hyperthyroidism due to increased motility
    - Long-standing DM due to enteric nervous system defects causing increased motility
    - Scleroderma etc may reduce motility
- Pancreatic insufficiency
    - chronic pancreatitis
    - All nutrients malabsorption
    - Steatorrhea with high volume, bulk and malodorous
    - Fat soluble vitamins deficiency
    - Weight loss 
- Bile salt deficiency
    - Heptobiliary disease
        - decreased synthesis or reduced secretion into gut lumen (PSC or PBC)
    - Ileal resection
        - reduced recycling of bile acids by enterohepatic circulation
        - Increased entry and concentration in colon causing ***secretory diarrhea***
        - Malabsorption due to inadequate concentration in lumen 
        - <100cm resection causes spillage into colon
        - >100cm resection causes loss of bile acids and malabsorption is predominant 
        - Crohn's
    - Bile acid diarrhea
        - functional diarrhea or IBS 
        - Reduced FGF-19 by ileal enterocyte
        - Bile acid sequestrants are treatment
    - Small bowel bacterial overgrowth
        - bacterial titres increase from duodenum to ileum normally
        - If motility affected or Stasis, bacterial overgrowth maybe seen 
        - like 
            - scleroderma
            - Pseudoobstruction chronic
            - Blind loop like Bilroth 2
            - Stricture
            - Crohn's fibrosis 
            - Diffuse diverticulitis
            - Resection of ileocecal valve increases counts from colon 
            - Diarrhea predominant IBS
        - Deconjugate bile acids, increasing absorption and reducing intraluminal concentration
        - Carbohydrate malabsorption and short chain FFAs production causing diarrhea and gas 
        - B12 deficiency due to bacterial metabolism of B12 leading to macrocytic Anemia
		- ***Elevated folate*** from bacterial folate systems
		- Diagnosis
			- Duodenal aspirates for bacterial titres is gold standard
			- Breath hydrogen test with lactulose
			- May treat empirically
		- Treatment
			- Surgical correction of blind loop
			- Endoscopic stricture dilation
			- Remove large diverticula 
			- Treat underlying
			- Rifaximin nonabsorbable antibiotic
			- others like metronidazole, doxicycline , Amoxicillin-clavulinic acid or cephalosporin for several weeks
# mucosal phase

	- 10-15% prevalence in first degree relative
	- HLA-DQ8 And HLA-DQ2 in 25-35% but testing has no value as also present in normal
	- Negative HLA rules out celiac with NPV >99%

	- Iron deficiency Anemia 
	- Duodenal disease
	- Severe diarrhea, weight loss and malabsorption of multiple nutrient
	- Primarily affects proximal small intestine but if diffuse upto jejunum also 
	- Growth failure in children

	- Villus atrophy leading to Steatorrhea from mucosal malabsorption
	- Maybe have lactase deficiency
	- Secretory component due to crypt hyperplasia and fluid hypersecretion
- Associated with 
	- Other autoimmune disease
	- T1-DM, thyroid disease
	- ***Dermatitis Herpetiformis vesicular rash mediated by IgA in skin*** 
	- Downs and turners 
- Diagnosis
	- serum antibodies

		- Deamidated anti-gliadin 
	- Serum IgA to rule out false negative from IgA deficiency
	- Confirm by endoscopic small intestinal biopsy
		- villus blunting

	- Marsh classification
	- Screen family members
- Complications
	- Refractory Celiac
		- Most common in active disease 
		- Ongoing diarrhoea weight loss and villus atrophy after 1 year of gluten-free diet
		- Negative serology to confirm adherence
		- Type 1 -- normal intraepithelial lymphos
		- Type 2 --clonal CD 3+ intraepithelial lymphos with monoclonal rearrangement of gamma chain of t cell receptor
		- Type 2 has worse prognosis and associated with t cell lymphpoma
	- Hyposplenism 
	- Small bowel adenocarcinoma
- Therapy

	- If no resolution of symptoms, repeat biopsy for 
		- severity of disease 
		- Other causes of diarrhea
		- Refractory disease
		- T cell lymphpoma
	- Most common cause of residual activity is noncompliance to diet 
- Non-celiac gluten sensitivity
- Symptomatic Celiac but no serology or biopsy

### Tropical sprue
- poorly understood syndrome
- Chronic diarrhea, weight loss, malabsorption
- Both folate and b12 deficiency
- Malabsorption of 2 unrelated substances required for diagnosis
- 8-20% of those having attack of gastroenteritis in India 
- Maybe a postinfectious complication
- Chronic diarrhea maybe infectious so do not consider unless cysts and trophozoites have been ruled out 
- Environmental enteropathy is a new diagnosis but closely related
- Etiology
	- Since response to antibiotics, likely infectious 
	- Uncertain etiology
	- Uneven distribution in tropics 
	- May develop long after leaving endemic areas
	- Multiple microorganisms implicated but not sure yet, some suggest their toxins maybe the cause 
	- Use of widespread antibiotics for acute diarrhea and better sanitation has reduced prevalence in 2-3 decades 
	- Folate malabsorption seen (absorbed in duodenum and proximal jejunum) 
	- Disease may resolve with folate supplements but unclear how 
- Diagnosis
	- Abnormal intestinal mucosal biopsy with chronic diarrhea
	- Evidence of malabsorption
	- Currently residing or lived in tropical countries
	- Similar biopsy to celiac 
		- More mononuclear infiltration

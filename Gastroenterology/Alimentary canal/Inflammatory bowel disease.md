* IBD is chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease of GI tract 
* UC and Crohn major type 
* Epidemiology 
	* Risk factors 
		* smoking 
			* UC lower 
			* Crohn higher 
		* Appendicectomy with appendicitis at young age 
			* protect from UC 
			* increases Crohn's 
		* OCPs increase Crohn's risk 
		* infections in first year of life increase risk 
		* breast feeding protect 
		* Infectious gastroenteritis with pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium difficile) increases by 2x-3x
# Etiology and Pathogenesis 
* homeostasis between commensals, epithelial cells and immune cells in tissues 
* all three from "supraorganism" and function in integrated matter 
* affected by specific genetic and environment factors (smoking , antibiotics , enteropathogens) 
* chronic state of dysregulated inflammation 
* IBD is inappropriate immune response to the endoge- nous (autochthonous) commensal microbiota within the intestines, with or without some component of autoimmunity
* In normal state, gut immune cells not active against commensals 
	* T regulatory cells that express FoxP3 transcription and suppress inflammation 
	* Local parenchyal cells oversee 
## genetics
- concordance in identical twins
- Occurs with genetic syndrome 
- Severe refractory IBD in immune system ***single gene defects***
- >60 defects recognised
	- ***IL10*** 
	- ***IL 10 receptor***
	- ***CTLA 4*** 
	- Neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 protein (***NCF2***)
	- X linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (***XIAP***)
	- ***LRBA*** lipopolysaccharide responsive and beige like anchor protein
	- tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A protein (TTC7)
- familial in 10% 
- Majority are polygenic, some maybe monogenic
- ![[IBDgenetics.PNG]]
- Most gene defects occur in regulatory areas of specific gene 
- Genetics only explains 20% disease occurence
- Also associated with immune process as responds to same immunotherapy
	- Rheumatoid arthritis TNFAIP3 
	- Psoriasis  IL23R IL12B 
	- ANKYLOSING SPONDOLYITIS (IL23R)
	- type 1 DM (IL10 PTPN2)
	- Asthma
	- SLE 
## Commensal microbiome
- central role in pathogenesis
- Born with sterile gut but get microbiome from mother during birth canal egress and later through environment
- 1000 species with 10^12 CFUs per gram of feces by age 3 
- Unique in everyone
- Control by 
	- Host as immune and epithelial response
	- Environment as diet and antibiotic
	- Genetic like NOD2 
- Early role during immune and epithelial cell development and may affect later risk of IBD 
- Dysbiosis seen in affected individuals
	- Proteobacteria like EIEC EAEC drive disease 
	- Firmicutes like Faecalibacterium prausniitzi are lost (usually reduce inflammation)
- Many changes in commensal due to inflammatory process 
- Agents that alter microbiome may improve CD (metronidazole, Ciprofloxacin, elemental diet)
## defective immune regulation
- normally nonresponse to luminal contents
- Soluble antigens when given orally (not parenterally) leads to ability to tolerate the antigen
- Tolerance mechanisms
	- Deletion
	- Anergy (non responsive) of antigen reactive T cells 
	- Induction of CD4+ T cells that supress Inflammation
	- Anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10 IL35 And TGF-Beta 
- Suppression of Inflammation altered in IBD
- Absence of tolerance mechanisms may cause IBD 
- Activation of Inflammation ***eacerbated by absence of bacteria***
## inflammatory cascade in IBD
- both genetic predisposition and environmental factors cause inflammation
- Response is ***perpetuated by T cell activation and inadequate regulatory pathways*** 
- Inflammatory cytokines IL1, 6 12 , 23 TNF-Alpha have unregulated activity in IBD 
- TH1 
	- IFN-GAMMA 
	- Transmural granulomatous inflammation like CD
- TH2 
	- Secrete IL 4/5/13 
	- Superficial mucosal Inflammation like in UC 
- TH17 
	- IL 17/21/22 
	- Neutrophil recruitment
- Cross regulations in cytokines pathway
	- TH1 initiated by IL12 
	- IL 4/23/6 and TGF-beta induce TH2 And TH17 
	- IL 23 inhibit regulatory T cells 
# Ulcerative Colitis
## Pathology
### macroscopic
- ***mucosal*** disease involving **rectum** to ***all and any part of colon*** 
- Location
	- Rectosigmoid and rectum in 40-50
	- Beyond sigmoid but not entire colon in 30-40 
	- Pancolitis in 20 
	- Pancolitis may extend to 2-3cm of terminal ileum in 10-20 (***Backwash Ileitis***)
- Proximal spread, Continuous, no breaks (biopsy from normal appearing areas is usually abnormal)
- always obtain ***biopsy from uninvolved mucosa*** also in endoscopy 
- Mucosal appearance
	- Mild has erythema with ***sandpaper*** (granular) surface
	- Severe has hemorrhagic, edematous, ***ulcerated mucosa*** 
	- Long-standing has ***inflammatory pseudopolyps*** 
	- ***Atrophic and featureless*** in many years and colon maybe narrowed and shortened
	- ***Fulminant may have toxic megacolon*** with thin wall and chance of perforation due to ulcerated mucosa
### microscopic
- histology correlates with appearance and clinical course 
- Mucosa submucosa affected
- Deeper layer unaffected except in fulminant
- Chronic features to differentiate from infectious or acute colitis
	- Bifid and reduced crypts 
	- Gap between crypt base and muscularis
	- Basal plasma cells and multiple lymphoid aggregates 
- Neutrophil invasion of crypts causes ***cryptitis and crypt abscesses***
- Backwash Ileitis has ***villous atrophy and crypt regeneration, cryptitis and crypt abscesses*** 

## Clinical Presentation 
* Signs and Symptoms 
	* diarrhea rectal bleeding , tenesmus , passage of mucus, crampy abdominal pain 
	* severity of symptoms related to disease extent 
	* Proctitis 
		* pass fresh blood or blood stained mucus 
		* tenesmus 
		* urgency with a feeling of incomplete evacuation 
		* slow proximal transit causing constipation 
	* beyond rectum 
		* blood mixed with stool or grossly bloody diarrhea 
		* rapid transit 
		* liquid bloody, pus stool in severe disease 
		* abdominal pain +/- 
	* physical signs 
		* tender anal canal 
		* blood on PR exam 
		* tenderness to palpation over colon in severe disease

# Crohn's
## Pathology
### Macroscopic
- any part of GI tract 
- Location
	- Small bowel only 30-40 
	- Both small and large 40-55 
	- Colitis only 15/25 
	- If small bowel involved (75%) then terminal ileum involved in 90% 
	- ***rectum often spared*** 
	- Perianal disease 1/3 
		- perirectal fistulas 
		- fissures 
		- abcess 
		- anal stenosis
	liver and pancreas rarely 
- ***Skip*** lesions present 
- ***Transmural*** process
- endoscopy 
	- mild -->aphthous or small superficial ulcerations
	- active disease --> stellate ulcerations fuse longitudinally and transversely to ***separate islands of normal mucosa (Cobblestone appearance )***
	- active has focal inflammation and fistula formation , which fibrose and form ***strictures*** 
- thickened mesenteric projections aka ***Creeping Fat*** 
### Microscope 
- earliest are ***noncaseating granulomas***, apthoid ulcers, focal crypt abcess 
- granulomas characteristic but usually seen in surgical specimen >> mucosal biopsy 
- submucosal or subserosal lymphoid aggregates, particularly away from areas of ulceration

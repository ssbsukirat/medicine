* IBD is chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease of GI tract 
* UC and Crohn major type 
* Epidemiology 
	* Risk factors 
		* smoking 
			* UC lower 
			* Crohn higher 
		* Appendicectomy with appendicitis at young age 
			* protect from UC 
			* increases Crohn's 
		* OCPs increase Crohn's risk 
		* infections in first year of life increase risk 
		* breast feeding protect 
		* Infectious gastroenteritis with pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium difficile) increases by 2x-3x
# Etiology and Pathogenesis 
* homeostasis between commensals, epithelial cells and immune cells in tissues 
* all three from "supraorganism" and function in integrated matter 
* affected by specific genetic and environment factors (smoking , antibiotics , enteropathogens) 
* chronic state of dysregulated inflammation 
* IBD is inappropriate immune response to the endoge- nous (autochthonous) commensal microbiota within the intestines, with or without some component of autoimmunity
* In normal state, gut immune cells not active against commensals 
	* T regulatory cells that express FoxP3 transcription and suppress inflammation 
	* Local parenchyal cells oversee 
## genetics
- concordance in identical twins
- Occurs with genetic syndrome 
- Severe refractory IBD in immune system ***single gene defects***
- >60 defects recognised
	- ***IL10*** 
	- ***IL 10 receptor***
	- ***CTLA 4*** 
	- Neutrophil cytosolic factor 2 protein (***NCF2***)
	- X linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (***XIAP***)
	- ***LRBA*** lipopolysaccharide responsive and beige like anchor protein
	- tetratricopeptide repeat domain 7A protein (TTC7)
- familial in 10% 
- Majority are polygenic, some maybe monogenic
- ![[IBDgenetics.PNG]]
- Most gene defects occur in regulatory areas of specific gene 
- Genetics only explains 20% disease occurence
- Also associated with immune process as responds to same immunotherapy
	- Rheumatoid arthritis TNFAIP3 
	- Psoriasis  IL23R IL12B 
	- ANKYLOSING SPONDOL

* peptic Ulcer is disruption of mucosal integrity of stomach or duodenum leading to local defect or excavation due to active inflammation
* Burning epigastric pain more with fasting and reduced by meals is classical 
* but >90% with symptoms have no ulcer
* Majority with PUD are asymptomatic
* Stomach and duodenal ulcers usually chronic
# gastric physiology
## gastric anatomy
* Epithelial lining has rugae with microscopic pits 
* Each pit branches to 4/5 glands of highly specialised epithelial cells 
* Glands vary with anatomy location
    * Cardia has <5% glands mostly mucous and endocrine
    * 75% in ***oxyntic mucosa*** contain mucous neck, parietal, chief, endocrine, enterochromaffin and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells 
    * Tuft cells in neck region of gland sample luminal contents and regulate secretion
    * Pyloric gland in antrum have mucosal and endocrine cells 
* Parietal cells
    * Oxyntic cells 
    * Neck or isthmus or in oxyntic gland 
    * Resting or unstimulated cell has prominent cytoplasmic tubulovesicles and intracellular canaliculi
    * with ***short microvilli*** along **apical surface**
    * ATPase on tubulovesicle membrane
    * ***Stimulation*** causes tubulovesicle and apical membrane to transform to dense network of apical intracellular canaliculi with ***long microvilli***
    * Acid secretion at apical canalicular surface
    * 30-40% of cell is mitochondria as high energy is required
    * also secretes ***IF*** and ***IL-11*** 
    * receptors for secretion enhancers like H2, gastrin (cholecystokinin 2/gastrin receptor) , acetylcholine (M3)
    * ***H2*** binding to histamine activates ***adenyl cyclase and phosphoinositol pathways,*** increasing intracellular cAMP and Ca respectively 
    * ***Gastrin and M3*** activates protein ***kinase C/phosphoinositide signaling*** pathway
## gastroduodenal mucosal defence
- constant attack by endogenous factors like HCl, pepsinogen/Pepsin, bile salts 
- Exogenous attack by medication, alcohol, bacteria
- 3 level barrier
    - mucus-bicarbonate-phospholipid layer
        - 1st line 
        - Physiochemical barrier
        - Blocks H ions 
        - By gastroduodenal surface epithelial cells
        - Mainly water (95%) with mucin and phospholipids
        - Nonstirred ***water layer impeding diffusion of ions and molecules***
        - ***Bicarbonate creates pH gradient*** (1-2 at gastric luminal surface to 6-7 at epithelial cell surface)
    - Surface epithelial cells
        - 2nd line 
        - ***Mucous*** production, ***ionic transporters*** to maintain intracellular pH and produce bicarbonate and intracellular ***tight junctions***
        - Produce ***Heat Shock Proteins*** that prevent protein denaturation
        - HSPs protect from high temperature, cytotoxic and oxidative stress
        - Also generate trefoil factor family peptide and cathelicidins protective of surface and regeneration
        - ***Restitution*** is gastric epithelial cells bordering a site of injury **migrating** to restore damage
            -  requires alkaline pH and blood supply
            - modulated by EGF, TGF-alpha and FGF 
            - Independent of cell division
        - Larger defects require ***proliferation*** 
        - Regeneration by PGs, EGF, TGF-alpha
        - Angiogenesis in new injured bed by FGF and VEGF 
        - Gastrin stimulates proliferation, migration, angiogenesis
        - ***Parietal*** cells make ***sonic hedgehog*** which may regulate stem cells 
    - Elaborate microvascular bed 
        - provides bicarbonate
        - Adequate supply of micronutrients and oxygen
        - Removes toxic byproduct
    - Prostaglandins (local)
        - regulate mucosal bicarbonate and mucus
        - Inhibit parietal cell secretion
        - Maintain blood and ***restitution***
        - COX-1 is constitutive while COX-2 is inducible (protects mucosal integrity)
        - NSAIDs blocking COX-1 cause gi side effects
        - But cox-2 selective inhibitor may increase CVS mortality so valdecoxib and rofecoxib removed 
    - NO 
        - NO synthase constitutively expressed
        - Stimulates mucos, increases blood flow and maintains Barrier function
    - Microbiome of stomach
## physiology of gastric secretion
- HCl and pepsinogen 
	- capable of inducing mucosal injury 
	- physiological role in protein digestion 
	- absorption of iron, Ca, Mg, Vit B12 
	- kill ingested bacteria 
- acid secretion 
	- basal and stimulated 
	- basal in circadian pattern 
		- highest at night 
		- lowest in morning 
		- cholinergic vagal input stimulates 
		- histamine from local gastric sources stimulates 
	- stimulated 
		- 3 phases based on ***signal origin***
		- cephalic 
			- sight, smell taste 
			- via vagus 
		- gastric 
			- once food enters stomach 
			- driven by nutrients (AAs and amines) 
				- directly (peptone/AA receptor) 
				- indirectly  --> G cell releases gastrin 
			- distension of stomach wall 
		- intestinal 
			- food in intestine 
			- distension 
			- nutrient assimilation 
		- inhibitory pathways also activated during phases 
			- Somatostatin 
				- from D cells in muscosa 
				- in response to HCl 
				- direct by parietal cells 
				- inDirect by reduced histamine , Ghrelin, gastrin 
		- Ghrelin, 
			- appetite-regulating 
			- Gr cells in the stomach, 
			- related peptide motilin (released from the duodenum) 
			- increase gastric acid secretion through stimulation of histamine release from ECL cells

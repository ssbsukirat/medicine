* peptic Ulcer is disruption of mucosal integrity of stomach or duodenum leading to local defect or excavation due to active inflammation
* Burning epigastric pain more with fasting and reduced by meals is classical 
* but >90% with symptoms have no ulcer
* Majority with PUD are asymptomatic
* Stomach and duodenal ulcers usually chronic
# gastric physiology
## gastric anatomy
* Epithelial lining has rugae with microscopic pits 
* Each pit branches to 4/5 glands of highly specialised epithelial cells 
* Glands vary with anatomy location
    * Cardia has <5% glands mostly mucous and endocrine
    * 75% in ***oxyntic mucosa*** contain mucous neck, parietal, chief, endocrine, enterochromaffin and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells 
    * Tuft cells in neck region of gland sample luminal contents and regulate secretion
    * Pyloric gland in antrum have mucosal and endocrine cells 
* Parietal cells
    * Oxyntic cells 
    * Neck or isthmus or in oxyntic gland 
    * Resting or unstimulated cell has prominent cytoplasmic tubulovesicles and intracellular canaliculi
    * with ***short microvilli*** along **apical surface**
    * ATPase on tubulovesicle membrane
    * ***Stimulation*** causes tubulovesicle and apical membrane to transform to dense network of apical intracellular canaliculi with ***long microvilli***
    * Acid secretion at apical canalicular surface
    * 30-40% of cell is mitochondria as high energy is required
## gastroduodenal mucosal defence
- constant attack by endogenous factors like HCl, pepsinogen/Pepsin, bile salts 
- Exogenous attack by medication, alcohol, bacteria
- 3 level barrier
    - mucus-bicarbonate-phospholipid layer
        - 1st line 
        - Physiochemical barrier
        - Blocks H ions 
        - By gastroduodenal surface epithelial cells
        - Mainly water (95%) with mucin and phospholipids
        - Nonstirred water layer impedi

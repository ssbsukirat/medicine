* peptic Ulcer is disruption of mucosal integrity of stomach or duodenum leading to local defect or excavation due to active inflammation
* Burning epigastric pain more with fasting and reduced by meals is classical 
* but >90% with symptoms have no ulcer
* Majority with PUD are asymptomatic
* Stomach and duodenal ulcers usually chronic
# gastric physiology
## gastric anatomy
* Epithelial lining has rugae with microscopic pits 
* Each pit branches to 4/5 glands of highly specialised epithelial cells 
* Glands vary with anatomy location
    * Cardia has <5% glands mostly mucous and endocrine
    * 75% in ***oxyntic mucosa*** contain mucous neck, parietal, chief, endocrine, enterochromaffin and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells 
    * Tuft cells in neck region of gland sample luminal contents and regulate secretion
    * Pyloric gland in antrum have mucosal and endocrine cells 
* Parietal cells
    * Oxyntic cells 
    * Neck or isthmus or in oxyntic gland 
    * Resting or unstimulated cell has prominent cytoplasmic tubulovesicles and intracellular canaliculi
    * with ***short microvilli*** along **apical surface**
    * ATPase on tubulovesicle membrane
    * ***Stimulation*** causes tubulovesicle and apical membrane to transform to dense network of apical intracellular canaliculi with ***long microvilli***
    * Acid secretion at apical canalicular surface
    * 30-40% of cell is mitochondria as high energy is required
    * also secretes ***IF*** and ***IL-11*** 
    * receptors for secretion ***enhancers*** like H2, gastrin (cholecystokinin 2/gastrin receptor) , acetylcholine (M3)
    * secretion ***inhibitor*** receptors GLP-1 , PGs, Somatostatin , EGF, neurotensin, urocortin 
    * ***H2*** binding to histamine activates ***adenyl cyclase and phosphoinositol pathways,*** increasing intracellular cAMP and Ca respectively 
    * ***Gastrin and M3*** activates protein ***kinase C/phosphoinositide signaling*** pathway
## gastroduodenal mucosal defence
- constant attack by endogenous factors like HCl, pepsinogen/Pepsin, bile salts 
- Exogenous attack by medication, alcohol, bacteria
- 3 level barrier
    - mucus-bicarbonate-phospholipid layer
        - 1st line 
        - Physiochemical barrier
        - Blocks H ions 
        - By gastroduodenal surface epithelial cells
        - Mainly water (95%) with mucin and phospholipids
        - Nonstirred ***water layer impeding diffusion of ions and molecules***
        - ***Bicarbonate creates pH gradient*** (1-2 at gastric luminal surface to 6-7 at epithelial cell surface)
    - Surface epithelial cells
        - 2nd line 
        - ***Mucous*** production, ***ionic transporters*** to maintain intracellular pH and produce bicarbonate and intracellular ***tight junctions***
        - Produce ***Heat Shock Proteins*** that prevent protein denaturation
        - HSPs protect from high temperature, cytotoxic and oxidative stress
        - Also generate trefoil factor family peptide and cathelicidins protective of surface and regeneration
        - ***Restitution*** is gastric epithelial cells bordering a site of injury **migrating** to restore damage
            -  requires alkaline pH and blood supply
            - modulated by EGF, TGF-alpha and FGF 
            - Independent of cell division
        - Larger defects require ***proliferation*** 
        - Regeneration by PGs, EGF, TGF-alpha
        - Angiogenesis in new injured bed by FGF and VEGF 
        - Gastrin stimulates proliferation, migration, angiogenesis
        - ***Parietal*** cells make ***sonic hedgehog*** which may regulate stem cells 
    - Elaborate microvascular bed 
        - provides bicarbonate
        - Adequate supply of micronutrients and oxygen
        - Removes toxic byproduct
    - Prostaglandins (local)
        - regulate mucosal bicarbonate and mucus
        - Inhibit parietal cell secretion
        - Maintain blood and ***restitution***
        - COX-1 is constitutive while COX-2 is inducible (protects mucosal integrity)
        - NSAIDs blocking COX-1 cause gi side effects
        - But cox-2 selective inhibitor may increase CVS mortality so valdecoxib and rofecoxib removed 
    - NO 
        - NO synthase constitutively expressed
        - Stimulates mucos, increases blood flow and maintains Barrier function
    - Microbiome of stomach
## physiology of gastric secretion
- HCl and pepsinogen 
	- capable of inducing mucosal injury 
	- physiological role in protein digestion 
	- absorption of iron, Ca, Mg, Vit B12 
	- kill ingested bacteria 
- acid secretion 
	- basal and stimulated 
	- basal in circadian pattern 
		- highest at night 
		- lowest in morning 
		- cholinergic vagal input stimulates 
		- histamine from local gastric sources stimulates 
	- stimulated 
		- 3 phases based on ***signal origin***
		- cephalic 
			- sight, smell taste 
			- via vagus 
		- gastric 
			- once food enters stomach 
			- driven by nutrients (AAs and amines) 
				- directly (peptone/AA receptor) 
				- indirectly  --> G cell releases gastrin 
			- distension of stomach wall 
		- intestinal 
			- food in intestine 
			- distension 
			- nutrient assimilation 
		- inhibitory pathways also activated during phases 
			- Somatostatin 
				- from D cells in muscosa 
				- in response to HCl 
				- direct by parietal cells 
				- inDirect by reduced histamine , Ghrelin, gastrin 
		- Ghrelin, 
			- appetite-regulating 
			- Gr cells in the stomach, 
			- related peptide motilin (released from the duodenum) 
			- increase gastric acid secretion through stimulation of histamine release from ECL cells 
	- H,K,ATPase creates H
		- membrane bound 
		- alpha and beta subunits 
		- alpha active 
		- ATP to secrete H from parietal to secretory canaliculi in exchange of K 
	- Chief cell secreres pepsinogen 
		- cleaved to pepsin 
		- requires pH<2 
		- activity dimnished at pH>4 
		- inactive at pH>7
# PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC BASIS OF PUD  
* PUD encompasses both gastric ulcers (GUs) and duodenal ulcers (DUs).
* Ulcers are defined as breaks in the mucosal surface >5 mm in size, with depth to the submucosa.
* risk factors 
	* H. pylori and NSAIDs most common 
	* COPD 
	* CKD 
	* tobacco use (current and former)
	* older age 
	* 3 or more doctor visits 
	* CAD 
	* former alcohol use 
	* obesity 
	* diabetes 
	* SSRIs 
	* gastric bypass surgery 
## Epidemiology 
* Duodenal Ulcers 
	* recently reduced surgery and physician visits 
	* reduced frequency of H pylori and improved sanitary conditions 
	* before h pylori, frequent recurrent occured 
* Gastric Ulcer 
	* later in life 
	* peak in 6th decade 
	* usually silent and present after complication 
## Pathology 
* DU 
	* D1 
	* 90% in 3cm of pylorus 
	* <1cm diameter (occasionally 3-6cm)
	* sharply demarcated ulcer, may reach upto muscularis propria 
	* base of the ulcer  zone of eosinophilic necrosis with surrounding fibrosis. 
	* Malignant extremely rare.
* GU 
	* may represent malignancy 
	* biopsy upon discovery always 
	* Benign 
		* most often found distal to the junction between the antrum and the acid secretory mucosa. 
		* Benign rare in fundus
		* histologically similar to DUs.
		* associated with H. pylori are also associated with antral gastritis.
		* NSAIDs induced have chemical gastropathy with 
			* foveolar hyperplasia 
			* edema of lamnia propria 
			* epithelial regeneration in absence of H pylori 
## Pathophysiology 
* Duodenal Ulcers 
	* H pylori and NSAIDs maximum 
	* average basal and nocturnal secretion increased 
	* H pylori 
	* Bicarbonate secretion reduced 
- gastric ulcer	
    - majority NSAIDs or h pylori 
    - Prepyloric in body with or DU or duodenal scar, similar to duodenal ulcers
    - Basal and stimulated increased
	* If minimal acid + ulcer , probably mucosal defence impaired 
    * Location
        * ***Type 1*** -- gastric **body** with ***low acid*** 
        * ***2 -- antrum with low to normal acid*** 
        * **3** -- **3cm of pylorus** and associated with ***DUs with normal to high acid*** 
        * 4 -- ***Cardia with low acid*** 
## H pylori and peptic disorders
- accounts for majority of PUD 
- Associated with MALT and adenocarcinoma
- Eradication reduces gastric cancer risk in those without chronic atrophic gastritis and metaplasia
- Bacterium 
    - initially Campylobacter pyloridis 
    - Gram negative
    - Aerophilic rod 
    - In deep mucous gel or between mucosa and epithelium
    - Does not invade cells 
    - ***S shape*** with multiple ***sheathed flagella***
    - Initially in antrum but proximal migration over time 
    - Pathogenesis and colonisation factors 
        - outer membrane protein ***Hop***
        - ***Urease*** 
        - ***Vac A*** is vacoulating cytotoxin
        - ***cag-PAI*** (cag pathogenicity island)
            - in most strains 
            - If present associated with higher rates of PUD, premalignant lesions and gastric cancer
            - May inhibit acid secretion by parietal cells, so low acid levels maybe seen in acute infection
    - Urease 
        - first step
		- produces ammonia from urea 
        - Alkaline pH created 
- Epidemiology
    - 80% infected in developing countries
    - Incidence increase with age 
    - Higher colonisation with poor socioeconomic status and education
- Pathophysiology
    - chronic active gastritis almost always
    - 10-15% have Frank ulcers
    - 99% (now 50-70) of DUs have h pylori but only 30-60 with GUs 
    - End result
        - gastritis
        - PUD 
        - MALT lymphpoma
        - Adenocarcinoma
    - Bacterial factor
        - GGT 
        - CagA 
        - Vac A -- targets CD4 cells 
        - PAMPS (pathogen associated molecular patterns)
            - LPS
            - Flagella
        - Urease 
    - Host
        - genetic predisposition
        - local injury by MHC 2 activation and apoptosis
        - IL 1,2,6,8 
        - Neutrophil mediated

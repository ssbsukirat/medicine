* reserved for histologically documented inflammation of mucosa 
* ***not the erythema seen in endoscopy*** 
* ***not interchangeable with "dyspepsia "***
* broad heterogeneous etiology 
* classification 
	* ![[gatritis-class.png]]
* Acute Gastritis 
	* commonly infectious 
	* H pylori induces gastritis 
	* presentation with 
		* sudden onset of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, and
		* limited mucosal histologic studies demonstrate a marked infiltrate of neutrophils with edema and hyperemia 
	* untreated evolves to chronic gastritis 
	* ***Phlegmonous gastritis*** 
		* bacterial infections 
		* rare 
		* potentially life-threatening 
		* marked and diffuse acute inflammatory infiltrates of entire gastric wall 
		* maybe associated with necrosis 
		* elderly individuals , alcoholics , AIDS patients affected 
		* polypectomy and mucosal india ink iatrogenic causes 
		* organism 
			* E coli 
			* proteus 
			* Haemophilus 
* Chronic Gastritis 
	* lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates 
	* very scant neutrophil 
	* inflammation may be patchy, initially involving superficial and glandular portions of the gastric mucosa 
	* may progress to more severe glandular destruction, with atrophy and metaplasia

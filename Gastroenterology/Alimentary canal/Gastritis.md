* reserved for histologically documented inflammation of mucosa 
* ***not the erythema seen in endoscopy*** 
* ***not interchangeable with "dyspepsia "***
* broad heterogeneous etiology 
* classification 
	* ![[gatritis-class.png]]
* Acute Gastritis 
	* commonly infectious 
	* H pylori induces gastritis 
	* presentation with 
		* sudden onset of epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, and
		* limited mucosal histologic studies demonstrate a marked infiltrate of neutrophils with edema and hyperemia 
	* untreated evolves to chronic gastritis 
	* ***Phlegmonous gastritis*** 
		* bacterial infections 
		* rare 
		* potentially life-threatening 
		* marked and diffuse acute inflammatory infiltrates of entire gastric wall 
		* maybe associated with necrosis 
		* elderly individuals , alcoholics , AIDS patients affected 
		* polypectomy and mucosal india ink iatrogenic causes 
		* organism 
			* E coli 
			* proteus 
			* Haemophilus 
* Chronic Gastritis 
	* lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates 
	* very scant neutrophil 
	* inflammation may be patchy, initially involving superficial and glandular portions of the gastric mucosa 
	* may progress to more severe glandular destruction, with atrophy and metaplasia 
	* atrophic gastritis associated with gastric CA 
	* Serologic and endoscopic  markers of severity 
		* gross inspection 
		* standard endoscopy 
		* magnification endoscopy 
		* narrow band imaging 
		* autoflourescence imaging 
		* Pepsinogen 1 and 2 levels 
		* gastrin 17 
		* anti H pylori 
	* Superficial gastritis 
		* early 
		* limited to the lamina propria of the surface mucosa,
		* edema and cellular infiltrates separating intact gastric glands
	* Atrophic gastritis 
		* next 
		* deeper extension into mucosa 
		* progressive distortion and destruction of cells 
	* gastric atrophy 
		* final 
		* loss of glandular structure 
		* paucity of inflammatory changes 
		* thin mucosa on endoscopy with clear visualisation of underlying vessels 
	* morphology transformation 
		* ***Intestinal metaplasia*** is gastric glands to intestinal type with mucosal cells ***containing goblet cells***
		* Patchy to fairly extensive
		* Predisposition to cancer 
	* Type A 
    	* Body predominant with antral sparing
    	* Autoimmune abs against parietal cells and IF (anti-IF more specific)
    	* Less common
    	* Pernicious Anemia maybe seen 
    	* Maybe seen in h pylori by molecular mimicry and abs develop to H, K-ATPase
    	* HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3
    	* Low pepsinogen
    	* Achlorhydria 
    	* Hypergastrinemia (due to G cell sparing and low acid) 
    	* May have gastric carcinoid tumors
    * Type B
        * Antrum predominant
        * More common
        * H pylori 
        * May progress to body and fundus 
        * Increases with age, in almost all with age >70 
        * Histology improvement after eradication
        * Early dense chronic infiltrate of lamnia propria with epithelial cell infiltration and polymorphonuclear leukocytes
        * Gastric adenocarcinoma may develop
        * H pylori is independent risk factor for Gastric cancer with 3-6x increase risk 
        * Low grade B cell MALT lymphoma
            * Initial stage with CT  and EUS 
            * Eradication regresses tumour in most 
            * Follow with EUS 2-3 months till regression
            * If grows, likely high grade lymphpoma which is unresponsive to eradication
    * Treatment
        * Aimed at sequelae

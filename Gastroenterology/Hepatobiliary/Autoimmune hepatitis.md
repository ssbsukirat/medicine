# Definition
- chronic disorder with continuous hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation, usually with fibrosis and may progress to failure and cirrhosis
- Is severe is untreated may have 40% 6 months mortality
- Extrahepatic features prominent and seroimmunological abnormalities suggest autimmune cause 
- All may not have autoantibodies or autoimmune features 
- Majority of ***idiopathic or cryptogenic*** chronic hepatitis are autoimmune
# immunopathogenesis 
- cell mediated immune attack due to loss of tolerance for self-liver antigens 
- Likely inherited
- Liver injury maybe triggered by environmental like drugs or viruses 
- maybe triggered by hep A B C due to genetic predisposition
- Evidence for autoimmune pathogenesis
	- HPE shoes cytotoxic T cells and plasma cells
	- Circulating autoantibodis, RF, hyperglobulinemia common
	- Associated with other autoimmune disease
	- HLA B1,B8

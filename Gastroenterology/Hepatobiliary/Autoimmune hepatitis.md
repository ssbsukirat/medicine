# Definition
- chronic disorder with continuous hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation, usually with fibrosis and may progress to failure and cirrhosis
- Is severe is untreated may have 40% 6 months mortality
- Extrahepatic features prominent and seroimmunological abnormalities suggest autimmune cause 
- All may not have autoantibodies or autoimmune features 
- Majority of ***idiopathic or cryptogenic*** chronic hepatitis are autoimmune
# immunopathogenesis 
- cell mediated immune attack due to loss of tolerance for self-liver antigens 
- Likely inherited
- Liver injury maybe triggered by environmental like drugs or viruses 
- maybe triggered by hep A B C due to genetic predisposition
- Evidence for autoimmune pathogenesis
	- HPE shoes cytotoxic T cells and plasma cells
	- Circulating autoantibodis, RF, hyperglobulinemia common
	- Associated with other autoimmune disease
	- HLA B1,B8 DR3 DR4 DRB1-0301 DRB1-0401 
	- Response to glucocorticoid therapy 
- Cellular toxicity predominant (CD4) t cells 
	- Molecular mimicry
	- Immunoregulatory control abnormal (CD4-CD25 influence impaired) 
- Antibodies
	- ANA (homogeneous pattern) 
	- Anti-smooth muscle (to actin, vimentin, skeletin) 
	- Antibodies to F-actin 
	- Anti-LKM 
	- Soluble liver antigen antibodies (against UGA transfer RNA suppressor protein)
	- Alpha actinin 
	- Hepatic lectin 
- Humoral immunity role in extrahepatic manifestation
	- Arthralgia arthritis
	- Cutaneous vasculitis
	- Glomerulonephritis
	- By deposit of circulating immune complex 
# clinical features
-  acute or insidious
- May mimic acute viral hepatitis
- Upto 1/4 may have no symptoms but abnormal liver function tests
- Lupoid hepatitis
	- Middle aged or young women 
	- High ANA titres 
	- Hyperglobulinemia
	- Positive SLE preparations
	- Fatigue, malaise, arthralgia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, jaundice 
	- Arthritis, maculopapular eruptions, erythema nodosum, colitis, pleuritis, pericarditis, Anemia azotemia occasionally
	- Keratoconjunctivitis, xerostomia (AKA SICCA SYNDROME) occasionally

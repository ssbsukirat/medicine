Acute Viral Hepatitis

- Acute viral hepatitis is a systemic infection affecting the liver predominantly.
- Caused by one of five viral agents: HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV (HBV-associated delta agent), and HEV.
- All human hepatitis viruses are RNA viruses, except HBV, which is a **DNA virus** but replicates like a retrovirus.
- All types produce clinically similar illnesses, ranging from **asymptomatic to fulminant** acute infections.
- Bloodborne types (HBV, HCV, HDV) can cause **subclinical persistent infections to rapidly progressive chronic liver disease** with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Hepatitis B

### Virology and Etiology

- HBV is a **DNA virus** with a remarkably compact genomic structure.
- Small, circular, **3200-bp** size.
- Codes for four sets of viral products with a complex, multiparticle structure.
- Encodes proteins from **four overlapping genes: S, C, P, and X**.
- Recognized as one of a family of animal viruses, **hepadnaviruses** (hepatotropic DNA viruses).
- Classified as hepadnavirus type 1.
- Similar viruses infect woodchucks, ground/tree squirrels, Pekin ducks, and have been found in ancient bird fossils and contemporary fish.
- Association with humans dates back **21,000 years**, primate viruses millions of years.
- Hepadnaviruses have three distinctive morphologic forms, envelope and nucleocapsid antigens, replicate in the liver but exist in extrahepatic sites, contain endogenous DNA polymerase, have partially double/single-strand genomes, are associated with acute/chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
- Rely on a replicative strategy unique among DNA viruses but typical of retroviruses.
- Entry into hepatocytes mediated by binding to the **sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide receptor**.
- Rely on **reverse transcription** of minus-strand DNA from a "pregenomic" RNA intermediate (effected by DNA polymerase).
- Plus-strand DNA transcribed from minus-strand DNA by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and converted in the hepatocyte nucleus to **covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)**, which serves as template for mRNA and pregenomic RNA.
- Viral proteins translated by mRNA, proteins and genome packaged into virions, and secreted.
- Difficult to cultivate in vitro from clinical material, but transfected cell lines support replication.

### Viral Proteins and Particles

- **Three particulate forms** of HBV exist.
- Most numerous are the **22-nm particles** (spherical or long filamentous), antigenically indistinguishable from outer surface/envelope protein (HBsAg), thought to represent excess viral envelope protein.
- Outnumbered by 100-1000:1 are large, **42-nm, double-shelled spherical particles**, which represent the intact hepatitis B virion.
- The envelope protein on the outer surface of the virion and smaller particles is **hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)**.
- Concentration of HBsAg in blood may reach **500 μg/mL**.
- Concentration of virus particles in blood may reach **10 trillion particles per milliliter**.
- HBsAg is the product of the **S gene**.
- HBsAg subdeterminants include a **common group-reactive antigen 'a'** (shared by all isolates) and subtype-specific antigens ('d' or 'y', 'w' or 'r').
- HBV isolates fall into at least **8 subtypes and 10 genotypes (A–J)**.
- Geographic distribution varies (e.g., Genotypes A/D in US/Europe, B/C in Asia), but migration has blurred distinctions.
- Clinical course and outcome are independent of subtype.
- Genotype B associated with less rapidly progressive liver disease/cirrhosis and lower/delayed likelihood of HCC than genotype C or D.
- Genotype A more likely to clear circulating viremia and achieve HBeAg/HBsAg seroconversion (spontaneously/therapy).
- "Precore" mutations favored by certain genotypes.
- Upstream of S gene are **pre-S genes (pre-S1 and pre-S2)**.
- Pre-S gene products code for receptors on the HBV surface.
- Three potential HBsAg gene products: **HBsAg (major protein)** from S gene; **middle protein** from pre-S2 + S; **large protein** from pre-S1 + pre-S2 + S.
- Complete 42-nm virions are enriched in the large protein.
- Pre-S proteins and antibodies can be detected, coincide with replication markers, but have little clinical relevance and are not routine.
- Intact 42-nm virion contains a **27-nm nucleocapsid core particle**.
- Nucleocapsid proteins coded for by the **C gene**.
- Antigen on nucleocapsid core surface is **hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg)**; corresponding antibody is anti-HBc.
- A third HBV antigen is **HBeAg**, a soluble, nonparticulate, nucleocapsid protein, immunologically distinct from HBcAg but product of the same C gene.
- C gene has two initiation codons: precore and core regions.
- Translation from precore region yields **HBeAg** (signal peptide for secretion).
- Translation from core region yields **HBcAg** (no signal peptide, not secreted, assembles into nucleocapsid particles).
- Core particles bind and incorporate RNA and ultimately contain HBV DNA.
- **DNA polymerase** packaged within the nucleocapsid core, directs replication and repair of HBV DNA.
- Synthesis of incomplete plus strand stops when packaging is complete.
- HBcAg particles remain in the hepatocyte, exported after encapsidation by HBsAg.
- **Naked core particles do not circulate in the serum**.
- Secreted HBeAg is a convenient, readily detectable, qualitative marker of **HBV replication and relative infectivity**.
- HBsAg-positive serum containing **HBeAg is more likely to be highly infectious** and associated with circulating virions and detectable HBV DNA.
- HBsAg-positive mothers who are HBeAg-positive almost invariably (>90%) transmit infection to offspring.
- HBsAg-positive mothers with anti-HBe rarely (10–15%) infect offspring.
- HBeAg appears transiently early in acute HBV, disappearance may herald resolution.
- **Persistence of HBeAg beyond 3 months** in acute infection may predict **chronic infection**.
- Presence of HBeAg during chronic HBV associated with ongoing viral replication, infectivity, and inflammatory liver injury (except early perinatally acquired).
- The third and largest HBV gene is the **P gene**, codes for **HBV DNA polymerase**.
- Polymerase has **DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNA-dependent reverse transcriptase** activities.
- The fourth gene is **X**, codes for small, nonparticulate protein **hepatitis B x antigen (HBxAg)**.
- HBxAg capable of **transactivating viral and cellular genes**.
- In cytoplasm, HBxAg effects calcium release, activates signal-transduction pathways, stimulates HBV reverse transcription and DNA replication.
- Transactivation may enhance HBV replication, associated with severe chronic hepatitis and HCC.
- Can enhance transcription/replication of other viruses (HIV).
- Transactivated cellular processes include human interferon-γ gene and class I MHC genes, potentially enhancing hepatocyte susceptibility to cytolytic T cells.
- Expression of X can also induce apoptosis.
- Clinical relevance of HBxAg limited, not part of routine practice.

### Serologic and Virologic Markers

- After HBV infection, first virologic marker in serum is **HBsAg**, detectable 1–12 weeks (usually 8–12 weeks).
- HBsAg precedes ALT elevation and symptoms by 2–6 weeks, detectable during icteric/symptomatic phase.
- In typical cases, HBsAg becomes undetectable 1–2 months after jaundice onset, rarely persists beyond 6 months.
- After HBsAg disappears, **antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs)** becomes detectable, remains indefinitely.
- HBcAg is intracellular, not routinely detectable in serum.
- **Anti-HBc** readily demonstrable in serum, beginning 1–2 weeks after HBsAg appears, precedes anti-HBs by weeks to months.
- "**Gap**" or "**window**" period: HBsAg undetectable, anti-HBs not yet detectable; **anti-HBc may be only serologic evidence** of current/recent infection.
- Blood with anti-HBc (without HBsAg/anti-HBs) implicated in transfusion-associated hepatitis B.
- Window period rarely encountered now with sensitive assays.
- Years after infection, anti-HBc may persist longer than anti-HBs.
- **Isolated anti-HBc** usually represents **hepatitis B infection in the remote past**.
- Rarely, isolated anti-HBc represents low-level viremia (HBsAg below detection threshold) or false-positive.
- Recent vs remote infection distinguished by **immunoglobulin class of anti-HBc**.
- **IgM anti-HBc predominates during first 6 months** after acute infection (current/recent acute).
- **IgG anti-HBc predominant beyond 6 months** (remote past/chronic).
- Acute hepatitis B diagnosis can be made by **IgM anti-HBc** even if HBsAg is undetectable (infrequent, ≤1–5% cases).
- Isolated anti-HBc in chronic HBV with low HBsAg is IgG class.
- Anti-HBs and anti-HBc generally persist indefinitely in recovered persons.
- **Anti-HBs is the protective antibody**; persons with anti-HBs are immune to reinfection. Prevention strategies based on providing anti-HBs.
- Low-level, low-affinity anti-HBs detectable in ∼10% of chronic hepatitis B patients, directed against a different subtype determinant; no clinical relevance, not signal of clearance. These patients have chronic HBV infection.
- **HBeAg** appears concurrently with or shortly after HBsAg, coincides with high levels of replication, reflects circulating virions/detectable HBV DNA (except precore mutants).
- In self-limited infections, HBeAg becomes undetectable shortly after peak ALT, before HBsAg disappears.
- **Anti-HBe** then becomes detectable, coinciding with lower infectivity.
- Markers of replication transient in acute infection, little clinical utility in typical cases. Valuable information in protracted infections.
- **Chronic HBV infection**: HBsAg detectable >6 months, anti-HBc primarily IgG, anti-HBs undetectable or low.
- Early chronic: HBV DNA in serum/hepatocyte nuclei (episomal). Relatively high replication, maximal infectivity/liver injury. HBeAg qualitative, HBV DNA quantitative marker. All three forms of HBV circulate.
- Relatively nonreplicative phase (∼10%/year): seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe. Coincides with transient, mild acute hepatitis-like ALT elevation. HBV DNA integrated into host genome. Only spherical/tubular forms circulate. Liver injury subsides. Most are inactive HBV carriers.
- In nonreplicative phase, replication detectable at low levels (≤103 virions/mL by PCR). Below this, liver injury/infectivity limited.
- Spontaneous reactivations: reexpression of HBeAg/HBV DNA, sometimes IgM anti-HBc, exacerbations of liver injury.
- High-titer IgM anti-HBc can reappear during acute exacerbations of chronic, may make distinguishing acute/chronic unreliable; history/follow-up helpful.
- HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis (precore mutations): replicative chronic hepatitis in absence of HBeAg.
- HBV DNA levels are lower in HBeAg-negative chronic HBV (usually ≤105 IU/mL) vs HBeAg-reactive.
- HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B: variable ALT patterns (persistent, periodic fluctuations).
- Serum HBV DNA (quantitative, sensitive measure) useful for following chronic B on antiviral therapy (Chap. 341).
- In immunocompetent adults with chronic B (except early perinatally acquired), general correlation between serum HBV DNA level and liver injury.
- High serum HBV DNA levels, increased viral antigens, necroinflammatory activity go hand in hand.
- Reduction of HBV replication with antivirals tends to improve liver histology.
- High levels of HBV DNA increase risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC.
- HBsAg titer bears little relation to disease severity; inverse correlation between serum HBsAg concentration and liver cell damage.
- HBeAg is principal clinical usefulness as indicator of relative infectivity; testing indicated primarily in chronic infection.
- HBsAg-positive serum of unknown duration: IgM anti-HBc distinguishes acute/recent (positive) from chronic (negative IgM, positive IgG).

### Molecular Variants

- Variants described that lack nucleocapsid proteins (commonly), envelope proteins (very rarely), or both.
- Two important categories: **precore mutants** and **escape mutants**.
- **Precore mutants**: identified in Mediterranean countries (severe chronic, detectable HBV DNA, anti-HBe instead of HBeAg).
- Mutation in precore region renders virus incapable of encoding HBeAg.
- Most common is single base substitution (G to A at nucleotide 1896 in pre-C gene), resulting in stop codon, prevents HBeAg translation.
- Core-promoter mutation prevents transcription of HBeAg coding region, yields HBeAg-negative phenotype.
- Patients with precore mutations may have severe liver disease, progress faster to cirrhosis, or are identified later.
- Wild-type and mutant HBV can coexist or mutant arises late.
- Clusters of fulminant hepatitis B attributed to precore mutant (Israel, Japan).
- Fulminant hepatitis B in North America/western Europe with wild-type. Mutants common even in mild self-limited cases.
- **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis with precore mutations is most frequently encountered form in Mediterranean countries/Europe**.
- Increasing in US due to immigration from Asia/Europe (~30–40% chronic HBV).
- **Escape mutants**: single amino acid substitution (Gly to Arg at position 145 of immunodominant 'a' determinant of HBsAg).
- HBsAg alteration leads to critical conformational change, **loss of neutralizing activity by anti-HBs**.
- Observed in vaccine recipients (acquired HBV despite anti-HBs) and liver transplant recipients treated with anti-HBs.
- Existence raises concern, may complicate vaccination strategies and serologic diagnosis.
- Different mutations emerge during antiviral therapy (e.g., YMDD in polymerase motif) (Chap. 341).

### Extrahepatic Sites

- HBV antigens and DNA identified in **lymph nodes, bone marrow, circulating lymphocytes, spleen, and pancreas**.
- Virus does not appear associated with tissue injury in these sites.
- Presence invoked (but not necessary) to explain recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation.
- Clinical relevance limited.

### Pathogenesis

- **None of the hepatitis viruses is known to be directly cytopathic to hepatocytes**.
- Clinical manifestations/outcomes determined by **host immunologic responses**. Immunopathogenesis of hepatitis B studied extensively.
- Inactive carriers with normal liver histology/function suggests HBV not directly cytopathic.
- Patients with defects in cellular immune competence more likely to remain chronically infected, supports role of **cellular immune responses** in liver injury.
- Model: **cytolytic T cells** sensitized to host and HBV antigens on liver cell surface destroy infected hepatocytes.
- Nucleocapsid proteins (HBcAg, possibly HBeAg) on cell membrane are target antigens.
- Differences in CD8+ T-cell response, helper CD4+ T cells, T-cell exhaustion, epitope escape mutations, antiviral cytokines explain outcomes (recovery vs chronic, mild vs severe/fulminant).
- Robust cytolytic T-cell response occurs and eliminates infected cells during acute B.
- However, >90% HBV DNA disappears from liver/blood before maximal T-cell infiltration/liver injury in chimpanzee model.
- Suggests **innate immune system and inflammatory cytokines** participate in early response (elimination of replicative intermediates/cccDNA).
- Innate immune response mediated largely by **natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity**.
- NK cells reduce helper CD4+ cells, resulting in reduced CD8+ and exhaustion of virus-specific T-cell response.
- Immunologic perturbations restored after successful antiviral therapy.
- **HBV-HLA–specific cytolytic T-cell responses of adaptive immune system** felt responsible for recovery.
- Debate over relative importance of viral and host factors in pathogenesis.
- **Precore genetic mutants** associated with more severe outcomes (severe chronic/fulminant), suggests relative pathogenicity is viral property.
- Rapidly progressive liver injury (fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis) in new liver after transplant for end-stage chronic HBV (under immunosuppression) suggests **direct cytopathic effect of HBV** without immune system.
- Studies on nucleocapsid proteins shed light on **immunologic tolerance** to HBV in babies born to HBeAg+ mothers.
- In utero exposure to HBeAg induces T-cell tolerance to nucleocapsid proteins; may explain chronic infection after early life infection.
- Alternative: defective priming of HBV-specific T cells during in utero exposure.

### "Immunotolerant" Versus "Immunoreactive" Chronic Hepatitis B

- Distinction between infection acquired at birth (East Asia) and adulthood (West).
- Infection at birth: **high immunologic tolerance**, absence of acute illness, almost invariable **lifelong chronic infection**. Culminates decades later in cirrhosis/HCC.
- Infection in adulthood: robust immune response, **acute hepatitis-like illness is the rule**, failure to recover is exception. Chronicity uncommon, very low HCC risk.
- Categorization: "immunotolerant" phase, "immunoreactive" phase, "inactive" phase. Simplistic, does not apply to typical adult self-limited acute B.
- Neonatally acquired: immunologic responses demonstrated (reduced levels). Intermittent necroinflammatory activity in early decades (quiescent, "immunotolerant"): dissociation between high replication and paucity of injury.
- Later decades ("immunoreactive/intolerant"): clinically apparent liver injury/progressive fibrosis emerge, but tolerance substantial.
- Dynamic equilibrium between tolerance and intolerance determines clinical expression.
- Neonates: relatively higher tolerance (high replication, low activity) early; relatively lower tolerance (activity reflects replication) later.

### Extrahepatic Manifestations

- **Immune complex–mediated tissue damage** appears to play a pathogenetic role.
- Occasional **prodromal serum sickness–like syndrome** in acute hepatitis B (arthralgia, arthritis, rash, angioedema, rarely hematuria/proteinuria) in 5–10%. Occurs before jaundice. Related to deposition of **HBsAg–anti-HBs circulating immune complexes** in vessel walls, activating complement. Confused with rheumatologic diseases. Diagnosis by ALT/HBsAg elevation.
- In chronic hepatitis B, other types of immune-complex disease seen.
- **Glomerulonephritis** with nephrotic syndrome (HBsAg, immunoglobulin, C3 deposition in glomerular basement membrane) observed occasionally.
- **Generalized vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa)** develops in <1% patients with chronic HBV. **20–30% of patients with polyarteritis nodosa have HBsAg** in serum. Affected arterioles contain HBsAg, immunoglobulins, complement.
- Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC) initially reported with hepatitis B, but association limited.

### Pathology

- Typical morphologic lesions of all types of viral hepatitis are similar.
- **Panlobular infiltration with mononuclear cells**, hepatic cell necrosis, hyperplasia of Kupffer cells, variable cholestasis.
- Hepatic cell regeneration (mitotic figures, multinucleated cells, rosette/pseudoacinar formation).
- Mononuclear infiltration primarily small lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils occasionally.
- Liver cell damage: degeneration/necrosis, cell dropout, ballooning, **acidophilic degeneration (Councilman/apoptotic bodies)**.
- **Large hepatocytes with ground-glass cytoplasm** in chronic (not acute) HBV, contain HBsAg (identified histochemically).
- Reticulin framework preserved in uncomplicated viral hepatitis.
- HBsAg localized to cytoplasm and plasma membrane of infected cells.
- HBcAg predominates in the nucleus, scant amounts in cytoplasm and cell membrane.
- **Bridging hepatic necrosis** (subacute/confluent necrosis, interface hepatitis) occasionally in acute. Large areas of cell dropout, collapse of reticulin framework. Bridge consists of condensed reticulum, inflammatory debris, degenerating cells spanning adjacent portal areas/portal-central/central-central veins.
- Association between bridging necrosis and poor prognosis not upheld in acute hepatitis. Has prognostic significance in chronic hepatitis (Chap. 341). Liver biopsies not routine in acute to identify this lesion.
- **Massive hepatic necrosis (fulminant hepatitis, "acute yellow atrophy")**: small, shrunken, soft liver postmortem. Histology: massive necrosis, cell dropout, extensive collapse/condensation of reticulin. Biopsy via transjugular route if needed in severe coagulopathy.

### Epidemiology and Global Features

- Modes of transmission overlap; distinction based on clinical/epidemiologic features is difficult. **Specific serologic testing** is most accurate.
- Percutaneous inoculation a major route, but "serum hepatitis" is inaccurate; many cases result from nonpercutaneous or covert percutaneous transmission.
- HBsAg identified in almost every body fluid; semen and saliva are infectious (less so than serum).
- Oral ingestion potential but inefficient.
- Greatest impact nonpercutaneous routes: **intimate (especially sexual) contact and perinatal transmission**.
- Sub-Saharan Africa: intimate contact among toddlers contributes to high frequency.
- **Perinatal transmission primarily infants born to mothers with chronic hepatitis B or acute B during 3rd trimester/early postpartum**.
- Perinatal transmission uncommon in North America/western Europe. **Very frequent and most important mode in East Asia/developing countries**.
- Likelihood of perinatal transmission correlates with HBeAg presence and high viral replication. **>90% of HBeAg-positive mothers transmit, only 10–15% of anti-HBe-positive mothers**.
- Most neonatal acute infection asymptomatic, child very likely to be chronically infected.
- **250–290 million persons with chronic HBV infection globally** constitute main reservoir.
- Serum HBsAg infrequent (0.1–0.5%) in US/western Europe normal populations. Prevalence **up to 5–10% in East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, tropical countries**.
- Higher prevalence in certain high-risk groups.
- High-risk groups: spouses of acutely infected, sexually promiscuous (especially men who have sex with men), health care workers exposed to blood, requiring repeated transfusions (hemophiliacs), residents/staff of custodial institutions for developmentally handicapped, prisoners, family members of chronically infected.
- Anti-HBs prevalence (previous infection) 5–10% in volunteer blood donors, higher in lower socioeconomic, older age, exposed to blood products.
- Risk from blood transfusion 1 in 230,000 to 1 in 346,000 due to sensitive screening.
- Geographic patterns: East Asia/Africa – disease of newborn/young children, maternal-neonatal spread cycle. North America/western Europe – primary disease of adolescence/early adulthood (sexual/percutaneous exposures).
- Immigration blurs distinctions; in US, prevalence in Asian persons (foreign-born) tenfold higher (3.1%) than overall (0.3%), representing 50% US burden.
- Incidence of newly reported HBV infections fell >80% in US during 1990s (safe behaviors, screening, vaccination).
- Imported cases in non-US-born persons outnumber domestic.
- HBV vaccine intro/universal childhood vaccination policies -> dramatic **∼90% decline in incidence**, dire consequences (HCC).
- US NHANES 2007–2012: HBsAg seropositivity in children 6–19 fell to 0.03% (∼85% reduction).
- Populations/groups for screening recommended (Table 339-3).

### Clinical and Laboratory Features

- Incubation period: **30–180 days (mean, 8–12 weeks)**.
- Prodromal symptoms variable (anorexia, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, etc.) 1–2 weeks before jaundice.
- Low-grade fever (38–39°C) more often in A/E than B/C, except when B is heralded by serum sickness–like syndrome.
- Dark urine/clay stools 1–5 days before jaundice.
- With jaundice onset, prodromal symptoms usually diminish. Mild weight loss common.
- Liver enlarged and tender, may have RUQ pain.
- Splenomegaly/cervical adenopathy in 10–20%.
- Posticteric phase variable (2–12 weeks), usually more prolonged in B/C.
- Complete recovery 3–4 months after jaundice onset in three-quarters uncomplicated, self-limited cases (in healthy adults, self-limited in 95–99% B). Remainder delayed.
- Substantial proportion never become icteric.
- HDV infection can occur with acute or chronic HBV infection. Duration of HDV determined by HBV.
- Simultaneous acute HBV/HDV: clinical/biochemical features may be indistinguishable from HBV alone, occasionally more severe.
- Acute HDV superimposed on underlying chronic hepatitis B: appears as clinical exacerbation or acute hepatitis-like episode. Superinfection often leads to clinical deterioration.
- Acute hepatitis-like clinical events in chronic HBV: spontaneous HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion or spontaneous reactivation.
- Reactivations in therapeutically immunosuppressed patients with chronic HBV when drugs withdrawn (restoration of immune competence).
- Acute clinical exacerbations of chronic B may represent emergence of a precore mutant.
- Cytotoxic chemotherapy can reactivate chronic C; immunomodulators (anti-TNF-α, anti-CD20 rituximab) can reactivate B and C.
- Serum aminotransferases (AST, ALT) increase during prodromal, precede bilirubin. Peak levels (400–4000+ IU) around icteric stage. Level doesn't correlate well with damage.
- Diagnosis of anicteric hepatitis based on clinical features and aminotransferase elevations.
- Jaundice visible when serum bilirubin >43 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL).
- Serum bilirubin typically rises to 85–340 μmol/L (5–20 mg/dL) with jaundice. May continue rising despite falling aminotransferases.
- Bilirubin >340 μmol/L (20 mg/dL) persisting late in course likely associated with severe disease. Exception: underlying hemolytic anemia (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, sickle cell) where high bilirubin (>513 μmol/L [30 mg/dL]) is common and not necessarily poor prognosis.
- PT important, prolonged value may reflect severe hepatic synthetic defect, signify extensive necrosis, indicate worse prognosis.
- Hypoglycemia occasionally in severe, related to poor intake/hepatic glycogen reserves.
- Serum alkaline phosphatase normal or mildly elevated. Fall in serum albumin uncommon.
- Diffuse mild γ globulin elevation common. Serum IgG and IgM elevated in about one-third, IgM more characteristic in acute A.
- Autoantibodies (smooth muscle, etc.), low titers rheumatoid factor, nuclear antibody, heterophile antibody occasionally found. LKM antibodies may occur in hepatitis D (different species than autoimmune hepatitis). Autoantibodies are nonspecific.
- **Virus-specific antibodies are serologic markers of diagnostic importance**.
- Diagnosis of HBV infection usually by HBsAg in serum. If HBsAg low/undetectable in acute B, IgM anti-HBc establishes diagnosis.
- HBsAg titer/serum concentration has inverse correlation with degree of liver cell damage. Titers highest in immunosuppressed, lower in chronic (higher in mild), very low in fulminant. Suggests damage/course relate to immune response, not HBsAg amount.
- In immunocompetent, correlation exists between markers of HBV replication and liver injury.
- HBeAg is marker of relative infectivity. Useful primarily in chronic infection.
- HBsAg-positive serum of unknown duration: IgM anti-HBc distinguishes acute/recent (IgM anti-HBc-positive) from chronic (IgM anti-HBc-negative, IgG anti-HBc-positive). False-positive IgM anti-HBc with high rheumatoid factor. IgM anti-HBc may be reexpressed during acute reactivation of chronic B.
- Anti-HBs rarely detectable with HBsAg in acute B. 10–20% chronic B may harbor low-level anti-HBs (against heterotypic subtype); no clinical significance, not signal of clearance.
- After vaccine (HBsAg alone), only anti-HBs appears. Serologic patterns Table 339-5.
- HBV DNA tests available (quantitative/sensitive measure of replication). First-generation hybridization 105–106 virions/mL. Amplification (PCR) 10–100 virions/mL. Most useful PCR: sensitivity 5–10 IU/mL, dynamic range 100–109 IU/mL. Useful in following chronic B on antiviral therapy (Chap. 341).

### Prognosis

- Acute B: 95–99% of previously healthy adults recover completely.
- Complicated/protracted course: advanced age, serious underlying medical disorders.
- Poorer prognosis: ascites, peripheral edema, hepatic encephalopathy.
- Suggest severe hepatocellular disease: prolonged PT, low serum albumin, hypoglycemia, very high serum bilirubin. Prompt hospital admission needed for these features.
- Case-fatality rate in B is **very low (∼0.1%)**, increased by advanced age/underlying disorders.
- Among patients ill enough to be hospitalized for acute B, fatality rate is 1%.
- Patients with simultaneous acute B and D do not necessarily experience higher mortality than B alone. Outbreaks acute simultaneous B/D in IDUs fatality ∼5%.
- When HDV **superinfection** occurs in chronic B, **likelihood of fulminant hepatitis and death is increased substantially**.
- Severe HDV superinfection outbreaks ("Lábrea fever") mortality rate >20%.

### Complications and Sequelae

- Prodromal serum sickness–like syndrome in acute B in 5–10% patients.
- Most feared complication: **fulminant hepatitis (massive hepatic necrosis)**; fortunately rare.
- Seen primarily in hepatitis B, D, and E. Rare fulminant A cases (older, underlying chronic liver disease).
- **HBV accounts for >50% of fulminant viral hepatitis cases**, a sizable proportion associated with HDV infection, and another proportion with underlying chronic C.
- Documenting disappearance of HBsAg after apparent clinical recovery from acute B is important.
- True rate of **chronic infection after clinically apparent acute B is as low as 1%** in normal, immunocompetent young adults. Earlier estimates (∼10%) may have included acute exacerbations of chronic.
- Patients who remain chronically HBsAg positive have IgG anti-HBc; anti-HBs undetectable or low.
- May be inactive carriers, mild chronic, moderate/severe chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis.
- Likelihood of remaining chronically infected after acute HBV infection is **especially high among neonates**, persons with Down’s syndrome, chronically hemodialyzed, and immunosuppressed patients (including HIV).
- **Chronic hepatitis** is an important late complication of acute B (small proportion). More common in those without acute illness (neonatal infection, immunosuppressed host).
- Features suggesting progression from acute to chronic B: (1) lack of complete symptom resolution, persistent hepatomegaly; (2) bridging/interface or multilobular hepatic necrosis on biopsy during protracted, severe acute; (3) failure of ALT, bilirubin, globulin to normalize within 6–12 months; (4) **persistence of HBeAg >3 months or HBsAg >6 months** after acute hepatitis.
- HDV **superinfection** can transform inactive or mild chronic B into **severe, progressive chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis**.
- Accelerates the course of chronic B and accelerates the risk of HCC.
- Some HDV superinfections in chronic B lead to fulminant hepatitis.
- Annual rate of cirrhosis in patients with chronic D is 4%.
- Although HDV/HBV infections associated with severe disease, mild hepatitis/inactive carriage occur, disease may become indolent after years.
- Chronic B, particularly neonatal/early childhood, especially HBeAg+/high HBV DNA, have **enhanced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma**.
- Risks of cirrhosis/HCC increase with HBV replication level.
- Annual rate of HCC in patients with **chronic D and cirrhosis is ∼3%**.
- Rare complications of viral hepatitis include pancreatitis, myocarditis, atypical pneumonia, aplastic anemia, transverse myelitis, peripheral neuropathy.
- In children, B may present with anicteric hepatitis, papular rash, lymphadenopathy (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome).
- Autoimmune hepatitis rarely triggered by self-limited acute hepatitis (reported after A, B, C).

### Differential Diagnosis

- Viral diseases (infectious mononucleosis, CMV, herpes simplex, coxsackieviruses, toxoplasmosis) may share features, cause ALT/bilirubin elevations. Tests helpful if HBsAg, IgM anti-HAV, IgM anti-HBc, anti-HCV negative.
- ALT elevations can accompany almost any systemic viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.
- Rare causes confused with viral hepatitis: Leptospira, Candida, Brucella, Mycobacteria, Pneumocystis.
- Drug history important. History of "repeated episodes" suggests underlying chronic hepatitis (e.g., autoimmune).
- Alcoholic hepatitis (usually less marked ALT elevation), other stigmata. Biopsy findings (fatty infiltration, neutrophilic reaction, alcoholic hyaline) consistent with alcohol-induced.
- Acute hepatitis confused with acute cholecystitis, common duct stone, ascending cholangitis (RUQ pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, icterus). Exclude before laparotomy, biopsy may be necessary.
- Viral hepatitis in elderly often misdiagnosed as obstructive jaundice (duct stone, pancreatic carcinoma). Severe in elderly, high operative mortality; evaluation needed.
- Mimics: Right ventricular failure/passive congestion, hypoperfusion syndromes (shock, hypotension, severe LV failure), disorders interfering with venous return (right atrial myxoma, constrictive pericarditis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive disease). Clinical features usually distinguish.
- Pregnancy: acute fatty liver, cholestasis, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome confused.
- Rarely, metastatic malignancies can mimic acute/fulminant.
- Genetic/metabolic disorders (Wilson’s, α1 antitrypsin, NAFLD) confused.
- Severe liver injury (ALT ≥1000 IU/L) common causes: ischemic liver injury, drug-induced (acetaminophen), acute viral hepatitis, pancreaticobiliary disorders.

### Treatment (Acute)

- Most persons with acute hepatitis B recover spontaneously, do not require specific antiviral therapy.
- In previously healthy adults with clinically apparent acute B, recovery ∼99%; antiviral therapy not likely to improve recovery rate, not required.
- In rare instances of **severe acute hepatitis B**, treatment with a **nucleoside analogue** at oral doses for chronic B has been attempted successfully.
- Most authorities recommend institution of antiviral therapy with a nucleoside analogue (entecavir or tenofovir) for **severe, but not mild-moderate, acute hepatitis B**.
- Treatment should continue until **3 months after HBsAg seroconversion or 6 months after HBeAg seroconversion**.
- Hospitalization for clinically severe illness, most patients do not require hospital care.
- Forced bed rest not essential. High-calorie diet desirable. IV feeding if persistent vomiting.
- Avoid drugs capable of adverse reactions/metabolized by liver.
- Cholestyramine helpful for severe pruritus.
- **Glucocorticoid therapy has no value** in acute viral hepatitis, may be deleterious, increase risk of chronicity (e.g., acute B).
- Physical isolation rarely necessary, except fecal incontinence (A/E) or bleeding (B/C).
- For patients with hepatitis B, emphasis on **blood precautions** (avoid direct ungloved contact with blood/body fluids). Enteric precautions unnecessary.
- Hand washing important. Universal precautions apply.
- Discharge after substantial symptomatic improvement, downward trend in ALT/bilirubin, return to normal PT. Mild ALT elevations not contraindications to gradual activity resumption.
- In **fulminant hepatitis**, goal is support: fluid balance, circulation/respiration support, bleeding control, hypoglycemia correction, treat complications of coma in anticipation of liver regeneration. Protein intake restricted, lactulose administered.
- Glucocorticoid therapy ineffective in controlled trials. Other procedures (exchange transfusion, plasmapheresis, etc.) not proven to enhance survival.
- Meticulous intensive care including prophylactic antibiotics improves survival.
- **Orthotopic liver transplantation** resorted to with increasing frequency, excellent results.
- In fulminant hepatitis B, oral antiviral therapy used successfully (anecdotally).

### Prophylaxis

- Emphasis on **prevention through immunization**.
- Historically, passive immunization with globulin preparations. Currently, active immunization with vaccines is preferred for A, B, E.
- **Hepatitis B**: Until 1982, passive immunoprophylaxis with standard IG or HBIG. Efficacy of standard IG questionable, HBIG efficacy challenged (reduces clinical illness, not prevents infection).
- First vaccine (1982) from purified HBsAg from plasma of carriers. Supplanted by genetically engineered vaccine from recombinant yeast (1987). Three recombinant vaccines licensed in US (Recombivax-HB 1986, Engerix-B 1989, Heplisav-B 2017).
- Recommendations for preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis.
- **Preexposure prophylaxis**: Three IM injections of hepatitis B vaccine recommended at 0, 1, and 6 months for settings of frequent exposure (high-risk groups listed).
- Pregnancy not a contraindication (except Heplisav-B due to lack of data).
- In low HBV endemicity areas (US), strategy of vaccinating high-risk groups not effective; **incidence increased**. <10% targeted high-risk vaccinated, ∼30% sporadic acute B not in high-risk.
- To impact frequency in low endemicity, **universal hepatitis B vaccination in childhood is recommended**. Unvaccinated children <19 years recommended vaccination.
- In hyperendemic areas (Asia), universal childhood vaccination -> dramatic **∼70–90% 30-year decline** in complications (liver-related mortality, HCC).
- Doses/schedules vary for approved preparations (Table 339-8). Combinations with other childhood vaccines available.
- Third recombinant vaccine (Heplisav-B 2017) for adults ≥18, novel adjuvant. Two IM doses a month apart. Higher protective anti-HBs levels vs Engerix-B. May be useful for revaccination of nonresponders.
- Novel recombinant vaccine (PreHevbrio 2021) with S, pre-S1, pre-S2 antigens. Three IM doses at 0, 1, 6 months. Higher protective anti-HBs levels/levels vs Engerix-B. Approved for adults ≥18.
- **Postexposure prophylaxis**: For unvaccinated persons exposed to HBV, combination of **HBIG** (rapid high-titer anti-HBs) and **hepatitis B vaccine** (long-lasting immunity, attenuating clinical illness) recommended.
- Perinatal exposure (HBsAg+ mothers): single dose HBIG (0.5 mL IM thigh) immediately after birth, followed by complete course of recombinant vaccine within first 12 h of life.
- Pregnant mothers with high HBV DNA (>2 × 105 IU/mL): adding antiviral nucleoside analogues (e.g., tenofovir) during 3rd trimester reduces perinatal transmission further.
- Direct percutaneous/transmucosal exposure to HBsAg+ blood/fluids (needle stick, etc.): single IM dose HBIG (0.06 mL/kg) as soon as possible, followed by complete vaccine course within first week.
- Sexual contact exposure to acute hepatitis B: single IM dose HBIG (0.06 mL/kg) within 14 days, followed by complete vaccine course.
- HBIG and vaccine can be given at same time but at separate sites.
- Testing adults for anti-HBs after vaccine advisable. Not recommended for children (immunogenicity nearly universal).
- Precise duration of protection unknown. ∼80–90% immunocompetent adults retain protective anti-HBs ≥5 years, 60–80% for 10 years. Protection documented for at least two decades after infant vaccination.
- Even after anti-HBs undetectable, protection persists against clinical B, HBsAg antigenemia, chronic HBV infection.
- Booster immunizations not routinely recommended, except immunosuppressed who lost detectable anti-HBs or immunocompetent with percutaneous HBsAg+ inoculations after losing antibody.
- Hemodialysis patients: annual anti-HBs testing, booster if anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL.
- Combined vaccine for A/B available.

# 341 Chronic Hepatitis

## Chronic Viral Hepatitis

- Enterically transmitted forms (A and E) are self-limited, do not cause chronic hepatitis (rare reports of acute A triggering autoimmune or chronic E in immunosuppressed hosts notwithstanding).
- Entire clinicopathologic spectrum of chronic hepatitis occurs in chronic hepatitis B and C, and in chronic hepatitis D superimposed on chronic B.

## Chronic Hepatitis B

- Likelihood of chronicity after acute B varies by age. Infection at birth: clinically silent acute, 90% chronic. Young adulthood (immunocompetent): clinically apparent acute, ∼1% chronic.
- Most chronic B cases among adults recognized in patients who never had clinically apparent acute B.
- Degree of liver injury (grade) variable, none in inactive carriers to severe.
- Among adults with chronic B, histologic features of prognostic importance. Progression to more severe chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis observed even in mild cases.
- More important than histology: degree of **HBV replication**. Level of HBV DNA correlates with liver injury and risk of progression in HBeAg-reactive and HBeAg-negative chronic B.
- **HBeAg-reactive chronic hepatitis B**: Two phases based on replication level.
    - **Relatively replicative phase**: HBeAg+, HBV DNA >103–104 IU/mL (sometimes >109), intrahepatocyte HBcAg, high infectivity, liver injury. Patients tend to have more severe chronic hepatitis.
    - **Relatively nonreplicative phase**: HBeAg-, anti-HBe+, HBV DNA <∼103 IU/mL, absence of intrahepatocytic HBcAg, limited infectivity, minimal liver injury. Patients tend to have minimal/mild chronic hepatitis or be inactive carriers.
- Spontaneous conversion from replicative to nonreplicative ∼10% per year.
- Distinctions in replication/histology do not always coincide. Childhood-acquired HBeAg-reactive chronic B in Asians: very high replication early decades (high tolerance) with negligible liver injury; activation emerges later. Link between high replication and late complications (cirrhosis, HCC, death) mostly in middle decades (age ≥40).
- **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B**: Active replication, detectable HBV DNA, but HBeAg- (anti-HBe-reactive). More common than HBeAg-reactive in Mediterranean/European/Asian countries (other genotypes).
- HBV DNA levels lower (usually ≤105–106 IU/mL) than HBeAg-reactive.
- Most cases represent precore or core-promoter mutations acquired late (early-life onset, age 40–55 years).
- Can have progressive liver injury (cirrhosis, HCC) and episodic reactivation ("flares").
- Biochemical/histologic activity of HBeAg-negative disease correlates closely with HBV replication levels.
- **Level of HBV replication most important risk factor** for ultimate cirrhosis and HCC in both HBeAg-reactive (beyond early decades) and HBeAg-negative patients.
- Achieving sustained responses (permitting therapy discontinuation) less likely in HBeAg-negative patients.
- **Inactive carriers**: HBsAg+, normal ALT, minimal/no histology injury, HBeAg-, HBV DNA undetectable or ≤103 IU/mL serially. Distinguishing from HBeAg-negative chronic during inactivity requires sequential monitoring.
- Clinical features broad, from asymptomatic to debilitating/fatal hepatic failure. Onset insidious in most who never had recognized acute B.
- Fatigue common symptom; persistent/intermittent jaundice in severe/advanced cases.
- Exacerbations (worsening fatigue, deepening jaundice, malaise, anorexia) reminiscent of acute hepatitis, may occur spontaneously (coinciding with virologic reactivation). May lead to progressive injury, hepatic decompensation in cirrhotics.
- Complications of cirrhosis occur in end-stage chronic hepatitis B.
- Extrahepatic complications (arthralgias/arthritis, purpuric cutaneous lesions/vasculitis, immune-complex glomerulonephritis, generalized vasculitis/polyarteritis nodosa) associated with tissue deposition of circulating HBV antigen–antibody immune complexes.
- Laboratory features do not distinguish mild/severe chronic B.
- Aminotransferase elevations modest, may fluctuate (100–1000 units). ALT tends to be more elevated than AST, but AST exceeds ALT once cirrhosis established. Alkaline phosphatase normal/marginally elevated.
- Moderate bilirubin elevations (51.3–171 μmol/L [3–10 mg/dL]) in severe cases. Hypoalbuminemia/prolonged PT in severe/end-stage.
- Hyperglobulinemia and detectable autoantibodies distinctly absent (contrast to autoimmune hepatitis).
- Viral markers of chronic HBV infection discussed in Chap. 339.

### Treatment (Chronic)

- Progression occurs primarily in patients with **active HBV replication**. Risk of HCC highest for those with continued, high-level HBV replication.
- Management directed at **suppressing the level of virus replication**.
- Short-term gains translate into reductions in risk of clinical progression, decompensation, HCC, transplantation, death. Regression of cirrhosis/varices documented after long-term pharmacologic suppression. Restoration of impaired T-cell function shown.
- Eight approved drugs: injectable IFN-α/PEG IFN, oral lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).
- **PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir (TDF and TAF) are recommended as first-line agents**; oral agents generally favored over injectable PEG IFN.
- **No treatment recommended or available for inactive carriers** (HBeAg-, normal ALT, HBV DNA ≤103 IU/mL serially).
- **HBeAg-positive, HBV DNA >2 × 104 IU/mL**: treatment recommended by AASLD for those with ALT >2× upper limit of normal. (EASL recommends treatment for HBV DNA >2 × 103 IU/mL and ALT above upper limit of normal).
- HBeAg-positive, ALT ≤2× upper limit of normal (common early life Asian infection): therapy not recommended currently (sustained responses not likely, requires multiyear therapy). Therapy considered for those >40, extrahepatic manifestations, family history cirrhosis/HCC, moderate/severe histology/fibrosis, prior treatment. Institute therapy when ALT becomes elevated later.
- **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B**: ALT >2× upper limit of normal (above upper limit of normal according to EASL), HBV DNA >2 × 103 IU/mL: antiviral therapy recommended.
- HBV DNA >2 × 103 IU/mL and ALT 1 to >2× upper limit of normal: same considerations as HBeAg-positive with borderline ALT. Treatment recommended according to EASL if ALT elevated.
- Current AASLD: oral agents can be stopped after HBeAg seroconversion in noncirrhotics; suggested consolidation 12 months with monitoring.
- **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis: indefinite therapy recommended with oral agents**. Stopping considered after HBsAg loss. Potential for stopping after protracted therapy (≥2-5 yrs) studied, virologic relapse rates high, but HBsAg loss occurs in small fraction. Enthusiasm for stopping limited, indefinite treatment recommended for most.
- **Compensated cirrhosis**: treatment recommended regardless of HBeAg/ALT if HBV DNA detectable >2 × 103 IU/mL (any level according to EASL). Suggested even for HBV DNA <2 × 103 IU/mL regardless of ALT.
- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: treatment recommended regardless of serologic/biochemical status if HBV DNA detectable. Evaluate as candidates for liver transplantation.
- Cirrhotics should be treated indefinitely.
- **PEG IFN, entecavir, or tenofovir (TDF or TAF) first-line therapy**.
- PEG IFN: finite duration, highest HBeAg response rate after 1 yr, no viral mutations, requires injections, difficult side effects, laboratory monitoring, intolerability.
- Oral nucleoside analogues: long-term/indefinite therapy for most. Lamivudine/telbivudine foster mutations; adefovir less so; entecavir (except lamivudine-experienced)/tenofovir rarely. No injections/cumbersome monitoring, well tolerated, improve histology 50-90%, suppress HBV DNA more profoundly than PEG IFN, effective in IFN nonresponders. Less likely HBeAg responses first year vs PEG IFN, but extended therapy yields comparable responses by year 2 (entecavir/tenofovir) without side effects. Responses durable after cessation for HBeAg-reactive. For HBeAg-negative, virologic remissions maintained after cessation in proportion of patients, durable biochemical remission higher rate.
- TDF/TAF safe, renal monitoring recommended for TDF (not TAF). TAF preferable for patients with reduced renal function, reduced bone density, risk factors for renal injury. Neither TDF/TAF recommended for creatinine clearance <15 mL/min.
- Lamivudine widely used in pregnancy, no teratogenicity identified (pregnancy category C). IFNs avoided in pregnancy (antiproliferative). Adefovir not associated with birth defects in pregnancy, risk of spontaneous abortion may be increased (category C). Entecavir safety data not published (category C). Telbivudine/tenofovir (category B) can be used safely during pregnancy. **Tenofovir is current drug of choice in pregnancy**.
- Children 2 to <18 (HBeAg-reactive): treatment if HBV DNA detectable and ALT elevated (not normal ALT). Drugs approved for different childhood age groups (package inserts for doses).
- Decompensated cirrhosis: very favorable resistance profile agents (entecavir or tenofovir) should be used. PEG IFN should not be used.
- Some observational studies suggest TDF superior to entecavir in reducing HCC risk, but data insufficient to support this benefit.
- End-stage chronic B undergoing liver transplantation: reinfection almost universal without antiviral therapy. Prevention of recurrent B achieved by combining short-term (5–7 days) IV HBIG with lifelong low-resistance oral entecavir or TDF/TAF (Chap. 345). Oral agents alone may be used instead of HBIG for lower risk. High risk: lifelong combination HBIG-oral agent considered. Livers from anti-HBc+ donors: lifelong oral-agent therapy recommended (without HBIG).
- HBV-HIV co-infection: progressive liver disease, occasionally severe exacerbation from immune reconstitution after ART. Lamivudine monotherapy contraindicated (HIV resistance). Entecavir low activity against HIV, can select resistance (not preferable). **Tenofovir and combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine are excellent choices**. Generally, treat for both HBV/HIV even if not meeting HIV treatment criteria. TAF preferable to TDF due to better safety profile.
- Chronic B patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy or treated with immunosuppressive/anticytokine/anti-TNF therapies: experience enhanced HBV replication. Risk of reactivation (often severe/fatal) when chemotherapy withdrawn (rebound activation).
- **Preemptive treatment with oral antivirals (entecavir, tenofovir preferred)** prior to chemotherapy substantially reduces reactivation risk; treating after reactivation less effective.
- Optimal duration of antiviral therapy after chemotherapy not known; suggested 6 months (12 months B cell-depleting agents) for inactive carriers, longer for others until standard endpoints met.
- Chemotherapy-associated reactivation common in HBsAg-reactive (4–68%, median 25%). Can occur (less common) in persons cleared HBsAg but anti-HBc+ (moderate risk, <10%). Rarely (<5%) even with anti-HBs+.
- Most authorities recommend HBsAg and anti-HBc (± anti-HBs) screening of all patients undergoing such chemotherapy.
- **Preemptive antiviral prophylaxis for HBsAg-reactive and anti-HBc-reactive persons treated with most potent agents (esp. B cell-depleting like rituximab)**. Close monitoring of other anti-HBc-reactive/anti-HBs-reactive persons, treatment if reactivation occurs.

## Hepatitis D

### Virology and Etiology

- Delta hepatitis agent, **HDV**, is the only member of the genus Deltavirus.
- **Defective RNA virus that co-infects with and requires the helper function of HBV** (or other hepadnaviruses) for its replication and expression.
- Slightly smaller than HBV, **formalin-sensitive, 35- to 37-nm**. Hybrid structure.
- Nucleocapsid expresses **HDV antigen (HDAg)**, which bears no antigenic homology with any HBV antigens. Contains the virus genome.
- HDV core "encapsidated" by an outer **envelope of HBsAg**, indistinguishable from HBV except in relative composition of HBsAg component proteins.
- Genome is a small, **1700-nucleotide, circular, single-strand RNA of negative polarity**. Nonhomologous with HBV DNA (except small polymerase gene area). Features and rolling circle replication model common to plant satellite viruses/viroids.
- Many internal complementarity areas, folds into stable rod-like structure with self-cleaving/self-ligating ribozyme.
- HDV RNA requires **host RNA polymerase II** for replication in hepatocyte nucleus.
- **HDAg** is the only known HDV protein, product of the antigenomic strand.
- HDAg exists in two forms: small (195 aa, facilitates HDV RNA replication) and large (214 aa, suppresses replication but required for assembly into virions).
- HDV antigens bind directly to RNA polymerase II, stimulates transcription.
- Viral assembly requires **farnesylation of the large HDAg** for ribonucleoprotein anchoring to HBsAg.
- Both HBV and HDV enter hepatocytes via the **sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide receptor**.
- Complete HDV virions and liver injury require HBV helper function, but **intracellular replication of HDV RNA can occur without HBV**.
- Genomic heterogeneity among HDV isolates described.
- Preliminarily, genotype 2 linked to milder disease, genotype 3 to severe acute disease.
- Clinical spectrum common to all **eight genotypes** identified; genotype 1 predominant.
- Report: in vitro HDV can assemble infectious particles with envelope glycoproteins from other viruses. Raises possibility of replication without hepadnaviruses, but co-infections in nature not observed.

### Serologic and Virologic Markers

- HDV antigen (HDAg) expressed primarily in hepatocyte nuclei, occasionally detectable in serum.
- During acute HDV infection, **IgM anti-HDV predominates**.
- 30–40 days may elapse after symptoms appear before anti-HDV can be detected.
- In self-limited infection, anti-HDV low-titer, transient, rarely detectable after HBsAg/HDAg clearance.
- In chronic HDV infection, **anti-HDV circulates in high titer**, both IgM and IgG detected.
- HDAg in the liver and **HDV RNA in serum and liver** can be detected during HDV replication.
- HDV infection can be identified by demonstrating intrahepatic HDAg or, more practically, an **anti-HDV seroconversion** (rise in titer or de novo appearance).
- Circulating HDAg, also diagnostic of acute infection, detectable only briefly, if at all.
- Retrospective serodiagnosis of acute self-limited, simultaneous HBV and HDV infection is difficult (anti-HDV often undetectable once HBsAg disappears).
- Early diagnosis of acute infection hampered by delay (up to 30–40 days) in appearance of anti-HDV.
- Acute hepatitis with HBsAg and anti-HDV: determination of **IgM anti-HBc is helpful** in establishing relationship between HBV and HDV.
- Simultaneous acute HBV and HDV infections: **IgM anti-HBc will be detectable**.
- Acute HDV infection superimposed on chronic HBV infection: **anti-HBc will be of the IgG class**.
- Assays for **HDV RNA**, available in specialized laboratories, can be used to confirm HDV infection and monitor treatment during chronic infection.

### Extrahepatic Manifestations

- Immune-complex disorders have been linked, albeit rarely, with hepatitis D.
- In chronic hepatitis D, antibodies to liver-kidney microsomes (anti-LKM) may be present.
- The anti-LKM seen in hepatitis D, **anti-LKM3**, are directed against uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase and are distinct from anti-LKM1 (seen in autoimmune hepatitis type 2 and subset of chronic C).

### Pathology

- HDV antigen is localized to the **hepatocyte nucleus**.
- Occasionally, microvesicular steatosis occurs in hepatitis D.

### Epidemiology and Global Features

- Infection with HDV has a **worldwide distribution**, but two epidemiologic patterns exist.
- **Mediterranean countries** (northern Africa, southern Europe, Middle East): endemic among those with hepatitis B, transmitted predominantly by **nonpercutaneous means, especially close personal contact**.
- **Nonendemic areas** (US, northern Europe): confined to persons exposed frequently to blood and blood products, primarily **injection drug users** (especially HIV-infected IDUs) and hemophiliacs.
- In US, hepatitis D is rare among persons with chronic hepatitis B.
- Prevalence in US national population 0.02% (1999–2012), 0.11% (2011–2016).
- Among HBsAg-positive persons in US, prevalence of HDV highest in IDUs (11–36%) and hemophiliacs (19%).
- HDV can be introduced into a population through drug users or migration from endemic to nonendemic areas.
- Patterns of population migration and human behavior facilitating percutaneous contact play important roles.
- Migrating epidemiology expressed in explosive outbreaks of severe hepatitis (e.g., "Lábrea fever" in Amazon basin, US urban centers). Outbreaks (co-infections, superinfections) may blur distinctions.
- Global HDV infection declined late 1990s.
- In Italy (HDV-endemic), public health measures to control HBV (mass vaccination) resulted in 1.5%/year reduction in HDV prevalence during 1990s.
- Frequency has not fallen below 1990s levels, reservoir sustained by survivors and immigrants from still-endemic areas.
- Current **global prevalence estimated at 62–72 million people**.
- Eight HDV genotypes: **genotype 1 is distributed worldwide**. Others geographically confined (2/4 Far East, 3 South America, 5-8 Africa).

### Clinical and Laboratory Features

- Incubation period for B and D from 30 to 180 days (mean, 8–12 weeks).
- Prodromal symptoms of acute viral hepatitis variable. Low-grade fever may be less often present in hepatitis B or C than A or E.
- Infection with HDV can occur in the presence of acute or chronic HBV infection. The duration of HBV infection determines the duration of HDV infection.
- When acute HDV and HBV infections occur simultaneously, clinical and biochemical features may be indistinguishable from those of HBV infection alone, although occasionally, they are more severe.
- When acute hepatitis D is superimposed on underlying chronic hepatitis B (superinfection), it appears as a clinical exacerbation or an episode resembling acute viral hepatitis. Superinfection often leads to clinical deterioration.
- LKM antibodies in hepatitis D are anti-LKM3, directed against uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase, distinct from anti-LKM1 seen in autoimmune hepatitis type 2 and subset of chronic C.

### Prognosis

- Patients with simultaneous acute hepatitis B and D do not necessarily experience a higher mortality rate than do patients with acute hepatitis B alone. In several outbreaks of acute simultaneous HBV and HDV infection among injection drug users, the case-fatality rate was ∼5%.
- When HDV **superinfection** occurs in a person with chronic hepatitis B, the **likelihood of fulminant hepatitis and death is increased substantially**.
- In outbreaks of severe HDV superinfection in isolated populations with a high hepatitis B carrier rate ("Lábrea fever"), a mortality rate **>20%** has been recorded.

### Complications and Sequelae

- Fulminant hepatitis is seen primarily in hepatitis B, D, and E.
- HBV accounts for >50% of fulminant viral hepatitis cases, a sizable proportion associated with HDV infection.
- HDV **superinfection** can transform inactive or mild chronic hepatitis B into **severe, progressive chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis**.
- It also can accelerate the course of chronic hepatitis B and accelerate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
- Some HDV superinfections in patients with chronic hepatitis B lead to fulminant hepatitis.
- Annual rate of cirrhosis in patients with chronic D is 4%.
- Severe disease associated with HDV and HBV, but mild hepatitis and even inactive carriage have been identified, and the disease may become indolent beyond the early years.
- Annual rate of HCC in patients with chronic D and cirrhosis is **∼3%**.

### Treatment (Chronic)

- Management of chronic hepatitis D is **not well defined**.
- Host cellular RNA polymerase (HDV depends on it) cannot be targeted by conventional antiviral agents.
- Glucocorticoids are ineffective.
- Preliminary experimental trials of IFN-α suggested transient lowering of HDV RNA and ALT during treatment, but no impact on natural history.
- High-dose IFN-α (9 million units three times a week) for 12 months reported associated with sustained loss of HDV replication and clinical improvement in up to 50%. Anecdotal reports: beneficial impact persists 15 years, associated with reduction in grade/stage, clearance of HDV RNA in some.
- Suggested approach: high-dose, long-term IFN for at least a year, extension in responders until HDV RNA/HBsAg clearance. However, extension to second year no advantage, sustained responses after completion rare.
- **Standard IFN-α is the only approved drug for hepatitis D**.
- **PEG IFN has been shown to be more effective but still of limited therapeutic value**.
- After 48 weeks of PEG IFN: durable undetectable HDV RNA for 24 posttreatment weeks in a quarter to just over a half. Loss of virologic responses during long-term monitoring in majority, durable suppression in only 12%.
- Extending PEG IFN therapy for 5 years/high doses showed improvement but sustained virologic responses in only 3 of 13 patients.
- None of the nucleoside analogue antiviral agents for hepatitis B is effective in hepatitis D.
- Adding oral nucleoside agents to PEG IFN is no more effective than PEG IFN monotherapy.
- Recommended 12 months of PEG IFN therapy is far from satisfactory.
- Preliminary trials performed with oral prenylation inhibitor lonafarnib and HBV/HDV viral entry inhibitor myrcludex B.
- Lonafarnib: reduced HDV RNA transiently, rebounded after completion.
- Myrcludex B: reduced HDV RNA in trials (monotherapy, combined with PEG IFN, PEG IFN alone), but no change in HBsAg. Brief trials, no sustained responses, toxicities encountered. Larger studies awaited.
- Additional experimental approaches: nucleic acid polymer therapy (inhibit HBsAg release) alone/with PEG IFN/nucleosides. Promising reductions HDV RNA/HBsAg in Eastern Europe studies, plagued by adverse effects (marked ALT elevations).
- PEG IFN lambda studied in small numbers: IFN-associated side effects, ALT/bilirubin elevations, modest on-treatment reductions HDV RNA.
- In patients with end-stage liver disease secondary to chronic hepatitis D, **liver transplantation has been effective**.
- Outcome of transplantation for chronic hepatitis D is superior to that for chronic hepatitis B.
- If hepatitis D recurs in new liver without hepatitis B expression (unusual in immunocompetent, common in transplant), liver injury is limited.
- In such patients posttransplant, combination HBIG and nucleoside analogue therapy for hepatitis B is indicated (Chap. 345).

### Prophylaxis

- Infection with hepatitis D can be **prevented by vaccinating susceptible persons with hepatitis B vaccine**.
- No product available for immunoprophylaxis to prevent HDV superinfection in persons with chronic HBV infection.
- For these patients, avoidance of percutaneous exposures and limitation of intimate contact with persons who have HDV infection are recommended.

Here are notes on Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D, drawn from the provided sources, in markdown format:

# Hepatitis B

## Acute Viral Hepatitis (Overview)

- Acute viral hepatitis is a systemic infection predominantly affecting the liver.
- Caused by one of five viral agents: HAV, **HBV**, HCV, HDV (HBV-associated delta agent), and HEV.
- HBV is a **DNA virus** but replicates like a retrovirus.
- All types produce clinically similar illnesses, ranging from asymptomatic/inapparent to fulminant/fatal acute infections.
- Bloodborne types (HBV, HCV, HDV) can cause subclinical persistent infections to rapidly progressive chronic liver disease with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Virology and Etiology

- HBV is a **DNA virus with a compact genomic structure**.
- Small, circular, 3200-bp size.
- Codes for four sets of viral products with a complex, multiparticle structure.
- **Efficient strategy of encoding proteins from four overlapping genes: S, C, P, and X**.
- Member of the hepadnavirus family (hepatotropic DNA viruses), classified as hepadnavirus type 1.
- Similar viruses infect woodchucks, ground/tree squirrels, Pekin ducks, ancient birds, fish.
- Association with humans dates back 21,000 years; primate HBV-like viruses date back millions of years, suggesting HBV predated modern humans.
- Hepadnaviruses have distinctive three morphologic forms, envelope/nucleocapsid antigens, replicate in the liver but exist in extrahepatic sites, contain endogenous DNA polymerase, have partially double/single-strand genomes, associated with acute/chronic hepatitis and HCC.
- Relies on a replicative strategy unique among DNA viruses but typical of retroviruses: **reverse transcription** (by DNA polymerase) of minus-strand DNA from a "pregenomic" RNA intermediate.
- Plus-strand DNA transcribed from minus-strand template by DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, converted in hepatocyte nucleus to **covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)** which serves as template for mRNA and pregenomic RNA.
- Viral proteins translated by mRNA, packaged into virions and secreted.
- Entry into hepatocytes mediated by binding to the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide receptor.
- Difficult to cultivate in vitro from clinical material, but transfected cell lines support replication.

## Viral Proteins and Particles

- Three particulate forms of HBV.
- Most numerous: **22-nm spherical or long filamentous particles** (thought to represent excess viral envelope protein).
- Large, 42-nm, double-shelled spherical particles: **intact hepatitis B virion** (Fig. 339-1). Outnumbered 100-1000:1 by spheres/tubules in serum.
- Envelope protein on outer surface of virion and smaller particles: **hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)**.
- HBsAg concentration in blood up to 500 μg/mL; virus particles up to 10 trillion/mL.
- HBsAg is the product of the **S gene**.
- HBsAg subdeterminants: common group-reactive antigen **'a'** (shared by all isolates), subtype-specific antigens **'d' or 'y'**, **'w' or 'r'**, and other specificities.
- HBV isolates fall into at least 8 subtypes and 10 genotypes (A–J).
- Genotypes A (subtype adw) and D (ayw) predominate in the United States and Europe.
- Genotypes B (adw) and C (adr) predominate in Asia. Geographic distinctions blurred by migration.
- Clinical course/outcome independent of subtype.
- Genotype B may be associated with less rapid progressive liver disease/cirrhosis and lower/delayed HCC than genotype C or D.
- Genotype A is more likely to clear circulating viremia and achieve HBeAg/HBsAg seroconversion (spontaneously and with therapy).
- Precore mutations favored by certain genotypes.
- **Pre-S genes** (pre-S1, pre-S2) are upstream of the S gene.
- Code for pre-S gene products, including receptors.
- Three potential HBsAg gene products: **major protein** (S gene), **middle protein** (pre-S2 + S), and **large protein**(pre-S1 + pre-S2 + S).
- Complete 42-nm virions are enriched in the large protein.
- Pre-S proteins and their antibodies can be detected, coincide with replication markers, but have little clinical relevance and are not in routine testing.
- Intact 42-nm virion contains a 27-nm nucleocapsid core particle.
- **C gene** codes for nucleocapsid proteins.
- Antigen on nucleocapsid core surface: **hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg)**; corresponding antibody is **anti-HBc**.
- **HBeAg**: soluble, nonparticulate nucleocapsid protein, immunologically distinct from intact HBcAg, product of same C gene.
- C gene has precore and core regions. Translation from precore region yields HBeAg (secreted). Translation from core region yields HBcAg (not secreted, assembles into particles).
- HBcAg particles bind to/incorporate RNA, ultimately contain HBV DNA.
- DNA polymerase packaged within the nucleocapsid core, directs replication/repair of HBV DNA.
- HBcAg particles remain in the hepatocyte, detectable by immunohistochemical staining.
- Exported after encapsidation by HBsAg envelope; **naked core particles do not circulate in the serum**.
- Secreted HBeAg: **convenient, readily detectable, qualitative marker of HBV replication and relative infectivity**.
- **P gene**: Largest gene, codes for HBV DNA polymerase. Has DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNA-dependent reverse transcriptase activities.
- **X gene**: Codes for small, nonparticulate protein, **hepatitis B x antigen (HBxAg)**.
- Capable of **transactivating transcription of both viral and cellular genes**.
- Effects calcium release in cytoplasm, activating signal-transduction pathways, stimulating HBV reverse transcription/DNA replication.
- Transactivation may enhance HBV replication, leading to association between HBxAg/antibodies and severe chronic hepatitis/HCC.
- Can enhance transcription/replication of other viruses (e.g., HIV).
- Can induce programmed cell death (apoptosis).
- Clinical relevance of HBxAg limited, not part of routine practice.

## Serologic and Virologic Markers

- After infection, first marker detectable in serum (1-12 weeks, usually 8-12): **HBsAg** (Fig. 339-4).
- Precedes ALT elevations/clinical symptoms by 2-6 weeks.
- Detectable during entire icteric/symptomatic phase and beyond.
- In typical cases, HBsAg undetectable 1-2 months after jaundice onset, rarely persists beyond 6 months.
- After HBsAg disappears, **antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs)** becomes detectable indefinitely.
- HBcAg not detectable routinely in serum.
- **Anti-HBc** readily demonstrable in serum (1-2 weeks after HBsAg appearance), preceding anti-HBs by weeks/months.
- **"Gap" or "window" period**: HBsAg undetectable, anti-HBs not yet detectable; **anti-HBc may be the only serologic evidence**.
- Blood with anti-HBc in absence of HBsAg/anti-HBs implicated in transfusion-associated hepatitis B.
- Window period rarely encountered due to increased sensitivity of HBsAg/anti-HBs assays.
- Years after infection, anti-HBc may persist longer than anti-HBs.
- Isolated anti-HBc usually indicates **remote past infection**, rarely low-level viremia or false-positive.
- **IgM anti-HBc predominates during the first 6 months after acute infection**.
- **IgG anti-HBc is predominant class beyond 6 months**.
- Patients with current/recent acute hepatitis B (including window) have IgM anti-HBc.
- Recovered remote past/chronic HBV infection: anti-HBc predominantly IgG.
- Rarely (≤1–5% acute HBV), HBsAg too low to detect; IgM anti-HBc establishes acute diagnosis.
- Isolated anti-HBc in rare chronic low-level carrier is IgG.
- Anti-HBs and anti-HBc generally persist indefinitely in recovered persons.
- **Anti-HBs is the protective antibody**; persons with serum anti-HBs are immune to reinfection. Prevention strategies provide anti-HBs.
- Occasionally (~10% chronic HBV), low-level anti-HBs detectable (against a different subtype determinant than patient's HBsAg). No clinical relevance, does not signal clearance. Patients with HBsAg and such anti-HBs have chronic HBV.
- After hepatitis B vaccine (HBsAg alone), anti-HBs is the only serologic marker to appear.
- **HBeAg** appears concurrently with or shortly after HBsAg.
- Coincides temporally with high levels of virus replication, reflects circulating intact virions and detectable HBV DNA. Exception: precore mutants cannot synthesize HBeAg.
- In self-limited infections, HBeAg becomes undetectable shortly after peak ALT, before HBsAg disappears.
- **Anti-HBe** then becomes detectable, coinciding with a period of relatively lower infectivity (Fig. 339-4).
- Transient during acute infection; testing for replication markers of little clinical utility in typical acute cases.
- Provide valuable information in patients with protracted infections.
- HBsAg-positive serum containing HBeAg is more likely highly infectious and associated with virions/detectable HBV DNA than HBeAg-negative/anti-HBe-positive serum.
- HBeAg-positive mothers >90% transmit infection to offspring, anti-HBe mothers rarely (10-15%).
- Early acute: HBeAg transient. Disappearance may herald clinical improvement/resolution.
- Persistence of HBeAg >3 months after acute onset may predict chronic infection.
- Presence of HBeAg during chronic hepatitis B associated with ongoing viral replication, infectivity, inflammatory liver injury (except early decades after perinatal acquisition).
- **HBV DNA** in serum: indicator of HBV replication, more sensitive and quantitative than HBeAg.
- First-generation hybridization assays sensitivity 10^5-10^6 virions/mL.
- Current amplification assays (PCR) sensitivity 10 or 100 virions/mL or 5-10 IU/mL. Dynamic range 100-10^9 IU/mL.
- Reactive well below 10^3-10^4 IU/mL threshold for infectivity/liver injury.
- Useful in following HBV replication in chronic hepatitis B during antiviral therapy.
- In immunocompetent adults with chronic HBV (except early decades post-perinatal), general correlation between serum HBV DNA level and liver injury.
- High-serum HBV DNA levels, increased viral antigen expression, and liver necroinflammatory activity go hand in hand unless immunosuppression interferes with T-cell responses.
- Reduction of HBV replication with drugs tends to improve liver histology.
- High levels of HBV DNA increase the risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC.
- Commonly Encountered Serologic Patterns: Summarized in Table 339-5.

## Molecular Variants

- Variation throughout HBV genome; variants may lack nucleocapsid/envelope proteins.
- Two important categories: **precore mutants** and **escape mutants**.
    - **Precore Mutants**: Identified in Mediterranean countries (severe chronic HBV, detectable DNA, but anti-HBe instead of HBeAg). Alteration in precore region renders virus incapable of encoding HBeAg. Most common: G to A substitution at nucleotide 1896 in pre-C gene (creates stop codon, prevents HBeAg translation). Another mutation in core-promoter prevents transcription of precore coding region.
    - Patients with precore mutations may have **severe liver disease**, progress more rapidly to cirrhosis, or are identified later in advanced stage.
    - Wild-type and mutant can coexist or mutant arises late.
    - Clusters of fulminant hepatitis B attributed to precore mutant (Israel, Japan). Fulminant HBV in N. America/W. Europe usually wild-type.
    - Precore/other mutations common even in typical self-limited cases.
    - **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis** with precore mutations is now the most frequently encountered form in Mediterranean countries and Europe.
    - Less common in US (genotype A prevalent), but increasing due to immigration (∼30–40% of chronic HBV in US).
    - Characteristic: **lower HBV DNA** (usually ≤10^5 IU/mL) and fluctuating ALT.
    - **Escape Mutants**: Single amino acid substitution (glycine to arginine at position 145) in immunodominant 'a' determinant of HBsAg.
    - Results in critical conformational change, **loss of neutralizing activity by anti-HBs**.
    - Observed in small number of vaccine recipients who acquired infection despite anti-HBs, and in liver transplant recipients treated with anti-HBs prep.
    - Existence raises concern that may complicate vaccination strategies and serologic diagnosis.
- Mutations emerge during antiviral therapy (e.g., YMDD in polymerase motif).

## Extrahepatic Sites

- HBV antigens and DNA identified in lymph nodes, bone marrow, circulating lymphocytes, spleen, pancreas.
- Virus not associated with tissue injury in these sites.
- Presence in reservoirs invoked to explain recurrence after liver transplantation (but not necessary).
- Clinical relevance of such extrahepatic HBV is limited.

## Pathogenesis

- Under ordinary circumstances, HBV is **not known to be directly cytopathic** to hepatocytes.
- Clinical manifestations and outcomes are determined by the **immunologic responses of the host**.
- Existence of inactive carriers with normal liver histology/function supports that virus is not directly cytopathic.
- Patients with cellular immune competence defects more likely to remain chronically infected, supporting role of cellular immune responses in liver injury.
- Model with most support: **cytolytic T cells** sensitized to recognize host and viral antigens on liver cell surface.
- Nucleocapsid proteins (HBcAg, possibly HBeAg) on cell membrane are viral targets for cytolytic T cells.
- Differences in T-cell responses (robustness, polyclonality, helper CD4+, exhaustion, escape mutations) explain outcome differences (recovery vs chronic, mild vs severe acute).
- Robust cytolytic T-cell response eliminates infected liver cells during acute B.
- > 90% of HBV DNA disappears from liver/blood before maximal T-cell infiltration/liver injury.
    
- Suggests **innate immune system and inflammatory cytokines** participate in early immune response.
- Effect shown to be elimination of HBV replicative intermediates from cytoplasm and cccDNA from nucleus.
- Innate immune response mediated largely by NK cell cytotoxicity, activated by cytokines/receptor expression.
- NK cells reduce helper CD4+, resulting in reduced CD8+/T cell exhaustion.
- Immunologic perturbations restored after successful antiviral therapy.
- Ultimately, HBV-HLA–specific cytolytic T-cell responses of **adaptive immune system** responsible for recovery.
- Debate over relative importance of viral and host factors.
- Precore mutants associated with more severe outcomes (suggests **viral pathogenicity** under certain circumstances).
- Concomitant HDV/HBV associated with more severe injury than HBV alone.
- In vitro, cells transfected with HDV antigen become necrotic without immunologic influences (consistent with viral effect).
- Rapidly progressive injury (fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis) in new liver after transplant under immunosuppression suggests **direct cytopathic effect of HBV**.
- Immunologic tolerance to HBV in babies born to mothers with highly replicative chronic HBV.
- In utero exposure to HBeAg induces T-cell tolerance to nucleocapsid proteins (may explain lack of clearance/lifelong infection with early life infection).
- Alternative explanation for mild neonatal infection/predisposition to chronic: defective priming of HBV-specific T cells during in utero exposure.

## Immunotolerant Versus Immunoreactive Chronic Hepatitis B

- Important distinction: infection acquired at birth vs adulthood.
- Infection at birth (endemic areas, East Asia): **high immunologic tolerance**, absence of acute hepatitis illness, **almost invariable establishment of chronic, often lifelong infection**. Culminates decades later in cirrhosis/HCC.
- Infection in adulthood (West): **robust host immune response**, acute hepatitis common, chronicity uncommon, low HCC risk.
- Categorization: "immunotolerant" phase, "immunoreactive" phase, "inactive" phase. Simplistic formulation, doesn't apply to typical adult self-limited acute B.
- Even in neonatally acquired (immunotolerant): immunologic responses demonstrated (reduced levels). Intermittent flares punctuate early decades (dissociation high replication/low inflammation).
- Even when injury emerges later (immunoreactive/intolerant): substantial tolerance remains.
- **Dynamic equilibrium between tolerance and intolerance** determines clinical expression of chronic infection.
- Neonatal infection -> higher tolerance (high replication, low injury) early, lower tolerance (and injury reflecting replication) later.

## Extrahepatic Manifestations

- Immune complex–mediated tissue damage plays a pathogenetic role.
- Occasional prodromal **serum sickness–like syndrome** (arthralgia, arthritis, rash, angioedema, rarely hematuria/proteinuria) in acute B (5-10%).
- Related to deposition of **HBsAg–anti-HBs circulating immune complexes** in blood vessel walls, leading to complement activation. Occurs before jaundice.
- Often misdiagnosed rheumatologic; diagnosis by elevated ALT and HBsAg.
- Chronic HBV: other immune-complex disease.
- **Glomerulonephritis with nephrotic syndrome** (HBsAg, Ig, C3 deposition in glomerular basement membrane).
- Generalized vasculitis (**polyarteritis nodosa**) in <1% chronic HBV, but 20-30% polyarteritis nodosa patients have HBsAg. Affected arterioles contain HBsAg, Ig, complement.
- **Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC)** initially associated with HBV, but limited association; substantial proportion has chronic HCV (immune complexes with HCV RNA).

## Pathology

- Typical morphologic lesions similar to other types: panlobular infiltration (mononuclear cells), hepatic cell necrosis, Kupffer cell hyperplasia, variable cholestasis.
- Regeneration present (mitotic figures, multinucleated cells, rosette/pseudoacinar formation).
- Mononuclear infiltration primarily small lymphocytes, sometimes plasma cells/eosinophils.
- Liver cell damage: degeneration/necrosis, cell dropout, ballooning, acidophilic degeneration (Councilman/apoptotic bodies).
- **Large hepatocytes with a ground-glass appearance** seen in **chronic (not acute) HBV infection**; contain HBsAg, identified histochemically.
- Reticulin framework preserved in uncomplicated viral hepatitis.
- Bridging hepatic necrosis observed occasionally in acute hepatitis. Large areas of cell dropout, collapse of reticulin framework. Bridging between lobules (portal-portal, portal-central, central-central). Composed of condensed reticulum, inflammatory debris, degenerating cells.
- Previously thought to have prognostic significance in acute, but not upheld. Has prognostic significance in chronic hepatitis.
- Massive hepatic necrosis (**fulminant hepatitis**): small, shrunken, soft liver postmortem. Massive necrosis, cell dropout, extensive collapse/condensation of reticulin.
- Immunohistochemical studies: **HBsAg localized to cytoplasm and plasma membrane**.
- **HBcAg predominates in the nucleus**, occasionally scant in cytoplasm/cell membrane.

## Epidemiology and Global Features

- Percutaneous inoculation long recognized as major route.
- Many cases result from less obvious nonpercutaneous or covert percutaneous transmission.
- HBsAg identified in almost every body fluid; semen and saliva infectious (less so than serum).
- Oral ingestion potential but inefficient route.
- Two nonpercutaneous routes with greatest impact: **intimate (sexual) contact and perinatal transmission**.
- Sub-Saharan Africa: intimate contact among toddlers instrumental in maintaining high frequency.
- **Perinatal transmission**: infants born to mothers with chronic HBV or (rarely) acute HBV in 3rd trimester/early postpartum.
- Uncommon in North America and western Europe.
- **Most important mode of HBV perpetuation in East Asia and developing countries**.
- Most perinatal infections occur approximately at the time of delivery, not related to breast-feeding.
- Likelihood of perinatal transmission correlates with **presence of HBeAg and high-level viral replication**. **>90% of HBeAg-positive mothers transmit**, only 10–15% of anti-HBe-positive mothers.
- Acute infection in neonate is clinically asymptomatic but child very likely to remain **chronically infected**.
- **250–290 million persons with chronic HBV infection in the world constitute the main reservoir**.
- Serum HBsAg frequency 0.1-0.5% in normal US/W. Europe populations. Up to 5-10% in East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, tropical countries.
- Higher prevalence in high-risk groups (Down's, leprosy, leukemia, Hodgkin's, polyarteritis nodosa, chronic renal disease on hemodialysis, injection drug users).
- Other high-risk groups: spouses of acutely infected, sexually promiscuous (MSM), health care workers exposed to blood, recipients of repeated transfusions/pooled products (hemophiliacs), residents/staff of custodial institutions, prisoners, family members of chronically infected.
- Risk from blood transfusion is low (1 in 230,000 to 1 in 346,000) due to screening.
- Geographically different epidemiologic patterns molded by prevalence, transmission modes, human behavior.
- East Asia/Africa: disease of newborn/young children, maternal-neonatal spread cycle.
- N. America/W. Europe: primarily disease of adolescence/early adulthood (sexual/percutaneous exposures).
- Dichotomy minimized by immigration from high-prevalence to low-prevalence areas.
- US NHANES 2007-2012: overall HBsAg prevalence 0.3%; in Asian persons (93% foreign-born) 3.1% (50% of US burden).
- Incidence of newly reported HBV infections fell >80% in US during 1990s (low of 3050 cases in 2013) due to safe behaviors, screening, vaccination.
- Imported cases in non-US-born outnumber domestic. NHANES 1999–2016: prevalence 0.24% foreign-born vs 0.06% U.S.-born. Asian foreign-born 3.85% vs US-born 0.79%.
- **Introduction of hepatitis B vaccine (early 1980s) and universal childhood vaccination** -> dramatic, ∼90% decline in new infections and consequences (HCC).
- US NHANES 2007–2012: HBsAg seropositivity in children aged 6–19 declined to 0.03% (~85% reduction).
- **Screening recommended for high-risk populations** (Table 339-3).

## Clinical and Laboratory Features

- Incubation period: **30 to 180 days** (mean, 8–12 weeks).
- Prodromal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, fatigue, arthralgias, etc.) may precede jaundice by 1-2 weeks.
- Low-grade fever (38–39°C) less often present than in A/E. Rarely higher fever.
- Dark urine/clay-colored stools 1-5 days before jaundice onset.
- With jaundice onset, prodromal symptoms usually diminish.
- Liver enlarged/tender, associated RUQ pain/discomfort.
- Occasionally, cholestatic picture.
- Splenomegaly and cervical adenopathy in 10-20%.
- Rare spider angiomas during icteric phase, disappear during convalescence.
- Recovery phase: constitutional symptoms disappear, but liver enlargement/lab abnormalities still evident.
- Posticteric phase variable (2-12 weeks), usually more prolonged than A/E.
- Complete clinical/biochemical recovery expected 3-4 months after jaundice onset in 3/4 uncomplicated, self-limited cases.
- **Acute hepatitis B is self-limited in 95–99% of healthy adults**.
- Substantial proportion of patients never become icteric.
- Chronic HBV: acute hepatitis-like clinical events may accompany spontaneous HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion or spontaneous reactivation (reversion to replicative).
- Reactivations can occur in therapeutically immunosuppressed patients after drug withdrawal (restoration of immune competence).
- Occasional exacerbations may represent emergence of a precore mutant.
- Cytotoxic chemotherapy, other immunomodulators (anti-TNF-α, rituximab) can lead to reactivation.
- Laboratory features: Serum aminotransferases (AST, ALT) increase during prodromal, precede bilirubin (Figs. 339-2, 339-4).
- Level does not correlate well with liver cell damage. Peak levels (400-4000+ IU/L) usually at clinical icterus, diminish progressively.
- Diagnosis of anicteric hepatitis: clinical features and aminotransferase elevations.
- Jaundice visible >43 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). Bilirubin 85-340 μmol/L (5-20 mg/dL) with jaundice onset. May continue to rise despite falling aminotransferases.
- Total bilirubin equally divided conjugated/unconjugated. Bilirubin >340 μmol/L persisting late suggests severe disease.
- High bilirubin levels (>513 μmol/L) common in underlying hemolytic anemia (G6PD deficiency, sickle cell), not necessarily poor prognosis.
- Neutropenia and lymphopenia transient, followed by relative lymphocytosis. Atypical lymphocytes common during acute phase (2-20%).
- **Prothrombin time (PT)** important; prolonged value may reflect severe hepatic synthetic defect, signify extensive necrosis, indicate worse prognosis. Occasionally prolonged PT with mild bilirubin/ALT.
- Hypoglycemia occasionally in severe from poor intake/hepatic glycogen.
- Alkaline phosphatase normal or mildly elevated. Fall in serum albumin uncommon in uncomplicated acute.
- Mild/transient steatorrhea, slight hematuria/proteinuria noted occasionally.
- Diffuse but mild elevation of γ globulin fraction common. Serum IgG/IgM elevated in ~1/3 acute phase; IgM level elevated more characteristically during acute A.
- Autoantibodies (smooth muscle, others), low titers rheumatoid factor, nuclear antibody, heterophile antibody can be found occasionally.
- In hepatitis C/D, anti-LKM may occur (different species).
- Autoantibodies in viral hepatitis are nonspecific. Virus-specific antibodies are diagnostic markers.
- Diagnosis of HBV infection usually by **detection of HBsAg in serum**.
- Infrequently, HBsAg levels too low during acute HBV; diagnosis by **presence of IgM anti-HBc**.
- Titer of HBsAg bears little relation to severity of clinical disease. **Inverse correlation between serum HBsAg concentration and degree of liver cell damage**.
- Titers highest in immunosuppressed, lower in chronic (higher in mild), very low in fulminant. Suggests severity relates to patient's immune response, not antigen amount.
- In immunocompetent, correlation between markers of HBV replication and liver injury.
- HBeAg principal clinical usefulness: **indicator of relative infectivity**.
- HBeAg testing indicated primarily in chronic infection (invariably present during early acute).
- For HBsAg-positive of unknown duration: IgM anti-HBc useful to distinguish acute/recent (positive) from chronic (negative, IgG anti-HBc positive).
- False-positive IgM anti-HBc with high-titer rheumatoid factor.
- IgM anti-HBc may be reexpressed during acute reactivation of chronic B.
- Anti-HBs rarely detectable with HBsAg in acute B.
- 10-20% chronic HBV may harbor low-level anti-HBs (directed against heterotypic subtype); no clinical significance.
- HCV RNA assays most sensitive tests for HCV infection, represent "gold standard". HBV DNA assays are gold standard for HBV replication.

## Pathology (recap)

- Immunohistochemistry: **HBsAg in cytoplasm and plasma membrane**, **HBcAg predominates in nucleus**.

## Prognosis

- Virtually all previously healthy patients with hepatitis A recover completely.
- Acute hepatitis B: **95–99% of previously healthy adults recover completely**.
- Complicated/protracted course suggested by advanced age, underlying disorders, severe presenting features (ascites, edema, encephalopathy), prolonged PT, low albumin, hypoglycemia, very high bilirubin. Prompt hospital admission for these features.
- Case-fatality rate in hepatitis A and B is very low (∼0.1%), increased by age/disorders.
- Fatality rate 1% in hospitalized acute hepatitis B.
- Patients with simultaneous acute hepatitis B and D do not necessarily experience higher mortality than acute B alone; **∼5% in several outbreaks among injection drug users**.
- When **HDV superinfection occurs in a person with chronic hepatitis B**, the likelihood of **fulminant hepatitis and death is increased substantially**. Mortality >20% recorded in severe HDV superinfection outbreaks.

## Complications and Sequelae

- Prodromal **serum sickness–like syndrome** may develop in 5–10% of patients during the prodromal phase of acute hepatitis B. Characterized by arthralgia or arthritis, rash, angioedema, rarely hematuria/proteinuria. Occurs before jaundice, often misdiagnosed rheumatologic diseases. Diagnosis by elevated ALT and HBsAg.
- EMC initially associated with hepatitis B, but substantial proportion has chronic HCV.
- **Most feared complication is fulminant hepatitis (massive hepatic necrosis); fortunately rare**.
- Seen primarily in hepatitis B, D, and E.
- **Hepatitis B accounts for >50% of fulminant cases of viral hepatitis**.
- Sizable proportion of fulminant B cases associated with HDV infection.
- Patients usually present with encephalopathy evolving to deep coma.
- Liver usually small, PT excessively prolonged.
- Rapidly shrinking liver, rapidly rising bilirubin, marked prolonged PT (even as ALT falls), clinical signs of confusion, etc., indicate hepatic failure with encephalopathy.
- High mortality rate (>80% in deep coma).
- Liver transplantation may be lifesaving.
- Fulminant hepatitis C very rare; **fulminant hepatitis B treated successfully with oral antiviral therapy (anecdotal)**.
- Documenting HBsAg disappearance important after apparent recovery from acute B.
- True rate of chronic infection after clinically apparent acute B is as low as **1% in normal, immunocompetent, young adults**. Earlier estimates (~10%) may have included acute exacerbations in chronically infected.
- Patients remaining chronically infected have IgG anti-HBc, undetectable or low-titer anti-HBs.
- May be inactive carriers, mild/moderate/severe chronic hepatitis.
- Likelihood of remaining chronically infected is **especially high among neonates, persons with Down’s syndrome, chronically hemodialyzed patients, and immunosuppressed patients (including HIV)**.
- **Chronic hepatitis is an important late complication of acute hepatitis B**, but more common in those presenting with chronic without acute illness (neonatal infection, immunosuppressed host).
- Clinical/laboratory features suggesting progression to chronic: lack of resolution of symptoms/hepatomegaly, bridging/interface/multilobular hepatic necrosis on biopsy during protracted severe acute, failure of labs (aminotransferase, bilirubin, globulin) to return to normal within 6-12 months, persistence of HBeAg >3 months or HBsAg >6 months after acute.
- Chronic hepatitis B, particularly those infected in infancy/early childhood, especially with HBeAg and/or high HBV DNA, have an **enhanced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)**.
- Risks of cirrhosis and HCC increase with the level of HBV replication.
- Annual rate of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis D and cirrhosis is ∼3%. (This relates to D, but involves chronic B).
- Rare complications: pancreatitis, myocarditis, atypical pneumonia, aplastic anemia, transverse myelitis, peripheral neuropathy.
- In children, rare presentation: anicteric hepatitis, nonpruritic papular rash, lymphadenopathy (papular acrodermatitis of childhood or Gianotti-Crosti syndrome).
- Rarely, autoimmune hepatitis can be triggered by self-limited acute hepatitis (reported after acute A, B, C).

## Differential Diagnosis

- Other viral diseases (infectious mononucleosis, CMV, herpes simplex, coxsackieviruses, toxoplasmosis) can cause aminotransferase/bilirubin elevations, share clinical features. Serologic tests helpful.
- Aminotransferase elevations can accompany almost any systemic viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.
- Rare causes confused with viral hepatitis: Leptospira, Candida, Brucella, Mycobacteria, Pneumocystis.
- Drug history important (many drugs can produce acute hepatitis or cholestasis).
- History of unexplained "repeated episodes" of acute hepatitis suggests underlying chronic hepatitis (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis).
- Alcoholic hepatitis must be considered (usually less marked ALT, other stigmata, biopsy shows fatty infiltration, neutrophilic reaction, alcoholic hyaline).
- Acute hepatitis confused with acute cholecystitis, common duct stone, ascending cholangitis. Viral hepatitis patients tolerate surgery poorly; exclude before laparotomy (biopsy needed in confusing cases).
- Viral hepatitis in elderly often misdiagnosed as obstructive jaundice (common duct stone, pancreatic carcinoma). Acute hepatitis in elderly can be severe, high operative mortality; thorough evaluation needed (biochemical, radiology, biopsy).
- Right ventricular failure with passive hepatic congestion or hypoperfusion syndromes (shock, hypotension, severe left ventricular failure) can mimic. Any disorder interfering with venous return (right atrial myxoma, constrictive pericarditis, hepatic vein occlusion [Budd-Chiari], veno-occlusive disease). Clinical features usually distinguish.
- Acute fatty liver of pregnancy, cholestasis of pregnancy, eclampsia, HELLP syndrome confused during pregnancy.
- Rarely, metastatic malignancies to liver mimic acute/fulminant viral hepatitis.
- Occasionally genetic/metabolic liver disorders (Wilson’s disease, α1 antitrypsin deficiency), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease confused.
- Severe liver injury (ALT ≥1000 IU/L): common causes ischemic injury, drug-induced (acetaminophen), acute viral hepatitis, pancreaticobiliary disorders.

## Treatment: Acute Viral Hepatitis

- Most patients with acute hepatitis B recover spontaneously, do not require specific antiviral therapy (recovery in ~99% healthy adults).
- Antiviral therapy unlikely to improve recovery rate, not required in typical cases.
- In **rare instances of severe acute hepatitis B**, treatment with a nucleoside analogue (entecavir or tenofovir) recommended.
- Treatment should continue until 3 months after HBsAg seroconversion or 6 months after HBeAg seroconversion.
- In most cases of typical acute viral hepatitis, specific treatment generally not necessary.
- Hospitalization for clinically severe illness, but most do not require.
- Forced/prolonged bed rest not essential. High-calorie diet desirable. IV feeding if persistent vomiting prevents oral intake.
- Avoid drugs producing adverse reactions or metabolized by liver.
- Cholestyramine helpful for severe pruritus.
- Glucocorticoid therapy has no value, may be deleterious, may increase risk of chronicity (acute B).
- Physical isolation rarely necessary (except fecal incontinence for A/E, bleeding for B/C/D).
- For hepatitis B: emphasis on **blood precautions** (avoid ungloved hand contact with blood/body fluids). Enteric precautions unnecessary.
- Importance of hand washing. Universal precautions apply.
- Discharge from hospital after substantial symptomatic improvement, downward trend in labs (ALT, bilirubin), return to normal PT. Mild ALT elevations not contraindication to gradual normal activity resumption.
- **Fulminant hepatitis**: Goal is support. Fluid balance, circulation/respiration support, bleeding control, hypoglycemia correction, treatment of coma complications. Anticipation of liver regeneration/repair.
- Protein intake restricted, oral lactulose administered.
- Glucocorticoid therapy ineffective. Other experimental therapies (exchange transfusion, plasmapheresis, etc.) not proven to enhance survival.
- Meticulous intensive care (incl. prophylactic antibiotics) appears to improve survival.
- **Orthotopic liver transplantation** resorted to with increasing frequency, excellent results.
- In fulminant hepatitis B, oral antiviral therapy used successfully (anecdotal).

## Prophylaxis

- Prevention through **immunization** emphasized.
- Prophylactic approach differs for each type.
- Passive immunization with antibody-containing globulin (IG/HBIG) used in past.
- Currently, **active immunization with vaccines** is preferable for hepatitis A, B, E.
- HBIG contains high-titer anti-HBs. Efficacy challenged, appears to reduce clinical illness frequency, not prevent infection.
- First vaccine (1982) from purified 22-nm HBsAg particles from plasma of carriers.
- Supplanted (1987) by genetically engineered vaccine from recombinant yeast (HBsAg particles, nonglycosylated but otherwise indistinguishable). Two recombinant vaccines licensed US 1980s (Recombivax-HB, Engerix-B), third (Heplisav-B) licensed 2017.
- Current recommendations: preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis.
- **Preexposure prophylaxis**: frequent exposure settings (health workers exposed to blood, first-responder public safety, hemodialysis patients/staff, custodial institutions, injection drug users, prisoners, multiple sexual partners/STDs, MSM, long-term blood derivative recipients [hemophiliacs], household/sexual contacts of chronic HBV, living/traveling extensively in endemic areas, unvaccinated children/adolescents/immigrants from endemic, persons from countries with HBV prevalence ≥2%, chronic liver disease, age <60 diabetes, end-stage renal disease, HIV infection).
- **Three IM injections of hepatitis B vaccine recommended at 0, 1, and 6 months** (other schedules Table 339-8). Deltoid site preferred.
- Pregnancy not contraindication (Heplisav-B not recommended pregnant due to lack of data).
- Universal hepatitis B vaccination in childhood recommended in low endemicity areas (US) to have impact.
- Incidence of new cases continued to increase in US after vaccine introduction (high-risk group vaccination not effective). <10% targeted high-risk groups vaccinated, ~30% sporadic acute B not in high-risk group.
- Unvaccinated children born after universal infant vaccination: vaccination during early adolescence (11-12 yrs) recommended. Extended to all unvaccinated children aged 0-19 yrs.
- HBV-hyperendemic areas (Asia): universal childhood vaccination -> dramatic (~70-90%) 30-year decline in complications (liver-related mortality, HCC).
- Two original aluminum-adjuvanted recombinant vaccines (Recombivax-HB 10 μg HBsAg, Engerix-B 20 μg HBsAg) comparable. Doses vary (Table 339-8). Combinations with other childhood vaccines available.
- Third recombinant vaccine (Heplisav-B, 2017) with novel adjuvant approved for adults ≥18. Two IM doses a month apart yielded higher proportion protective anti-HBs than Engerix-B. May be useful for revaccination failures.
- Novel recombinant vaccine (PreHevbrio, 2021) with S, pre-S1, pre-S2 antigens approved for adults ≥18. Three IM doses (0, 1, 6 months) achieve higher proportions protective anti-HBs/higher antibody levels than Engerix-B. Includes older persons, diabetes, overweight.
- **Postexposure prophylaxis**: unvaccinated persons sustaining exposure to HBV.
- Combination of **HBIG** (rapid high-titer anti-HBs) and **hepatitis B vaccine** (long-lasting immunity, attenuates clinical illness) recommended.
- Perinatal exposure to HBsAg-positive mothers: single dose HBIG (0.5 mL IM thigh) immediately after birth + complete course recombinant hepatitis B vaccines (approved for children) within first 12 h of life.
- Pregnant mothers with high-level HBV DNA (>2 × 10^5 IU/mL): adding antiviral nucleoside analogues (e.g., tenofovir) during 3rd trimester reduces perinatal transmission further.
- Direct percutaneous/transmucosal exposure to HBsAg-positive blood/body fluids (needle stick, etc.): single IM dose HBIG (0.06 mL/kg) as soon as possible + complete course vaccine within first week.
- Sexual contact exposure to acute hepatitis B patient: single IM dose HBIG (0.06 mL/kg) within 14 days + complete course vaccine.
- HBIG and vaccine can be given simultaneously at separate sites.
- Testing adults for anti-HBs after vaccine advisable. Not recommended for children (immunogenicity nearly universal).
- Precise duration of protection unknown. ~80-90% immunocompetent adults retain protective anti-HBs ≥5 years, 60-80% for 10 years. Protective antibody documented ≥2 decades after infancy vaccination.
- Even after anti-HBs becomes undetectable, protection persists against clinical B, HBsAgemia, chronic HBV.
- Booster immunizations not recommended routinely. Exceptions: immunosuppressed persons who lost detectable anti-HBs, immunocompetent persons with percutaneous HBsAg-positive inoculations after losing detectable antibody.
- Hemodialysis patients: annual anti-HBs testing recommended after vaccination; boosters recommended when anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL.
- Combined vaccine for hepatitis A and B available (inactivated HAV + recombinant HBsAg).

## Treatment: Chronic Hepatitis B

- Management directed at suppressing the level of virus replication.
- Suppression translates into reduced risk of clinical progression, hepatic decompensation, HCC, liver transplantation, and death.
- Regression of cirrhosis and esophageal varices documented after long-term pharmacologic suppression.
- Restoration of impaired HBV-specific T-cell function shown after successful suppression.
- Eight approved drugs: injectable IFN-α, PEG IFN; oral lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).
- **PEG IFN, entecavir, TDF, and TAF are recommended as first-line agents**. Oral agents generally favored over injectable. Lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine no longer preferred.
- See detailed efficacy/resistance profiles for each drug [167-193, Table 341-3].
- **No treatment recommended or available for inactive carriers** (undetectable HBeAg, normal ALT, HBV DNA ≤10^3 IU/mL serially).
- **HBeAg-reactive, HBV DNA >2 × 10^4 IU/mL**: Treatment recommended by AASLD for those with ALT levels >2× ULN. EASL recommends treatment for HBV DNA >2 × 10^3 IU/mL and ALT above ULN.
- **HBeAg-reactive, ALT ≤2× ULN**: Antiviral therapy not recommended currently (sustained responses unlikely, requires multiyear therapy). Considerations for treatment in this group: >40 years, extrahepatic manifestations, family history of cirrhosis/HCC, moderate/severe histology/fibrosis, history of previous treatment. Institute therapy when ALT becomes elevated later.
- **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, ALT >2× ULN (above ULN EASL), and HBV DNA >2 × 10^3 IU/mL**: Antiviral therapy recommended.
- **HBeAg-negative, HBV DNA >2 × 10^3 IU/mL, and ALT 1 to >2× ULN**: Same considerations as HBeAg+ borderline ALT (>40 years, extrahepatic, FH, histology, prior Tx). Treatment recommended by EASL if ALT elevated.
- **Stopping Treatment (Oral Agents)**: Can be stopped after HBeAg seroconversion in noncirrhotics; 12 months consolidation therapy with close monitoring suggested.
- **HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis**: Recommendation with oral agents is for **indefinite therapy**. Stopping can be considered after HBsAg loss. Studies show high virologic relapse rates after stopping, but some don't require retreatment, and HBsAg loss occurs in a minority.
- **Compensated cirrhosis**: Treatment recommended regardless of HBeAg status and ALT as long as HBV DNA is detectable at >2 × 10^3 IU/mL (detectable at any level according to EASL). Suggested even for those with HBV DNA <2 × 10^3 IU/mL. Cirrhotics should be treated indefinitely.
- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: Treatment recommended regardless of serologic and biochemical status, as long as HBV DNA is detectable. Evaluate as candidates for liver transplantation. Cirrhotics should be treated indefinitely.
- **Drug Choice**: PEG IFN, entecavir, or tenofovir (TDF or TAF) as first-line therapy.
    - PEG IFN: Finite duration, highest HBeAg response rate at 1 year, no viral mutations. But requires injections, side effects, monitoring, intolerability.
    - Oral nucleoside analogues: Long-term usually, ETV/tenofovir rarely foster mutations. No injections, well tolerated, improve histology, suppress DNA more profoundly. Effective in IFN failures. Lower HBeAg response rate first year, but comparable/higher by end of 2nd year with extended therapy. Durable responses documented.
- **Renal/Bone Toxicity**: Renal monitoring recommended for TDF and adefovir (serum creatinine/phosphate, urine glucose/protein). Not for TAF. TAF minimizes these side effects. TAF preferable over TDF for reduced renal function, reduced bone density, risk factors for renal injury (>60 years, decompensated cirrhosis, creat cl <60, hypertension, diabetes, proteinuria, glomerulonephritis, nephrotoxic meds, transplant). Neither TDF/TAF recommended for creatinine clearance <15 mL/min.
- **Pregnancy**: IFN avoided. ADV category C. ETV category C. TBV category B. Tenofovir category B. Lamivudine category C. Tenofovir is the current drug of choice. TBV not acceptable first-line.
- **Children (2 to <18 years)**: Treatment recommended for HBeAg-reactive with detectable HBV DNA and elevated ALT. Approved drugs differ by age group (IFN-α2b ≥1 yr, PEG IFN-α2a ≥5 yrs, LAM/ETV ≥2 yrs, ADV/tenofovir ≥12 yrs).
- **Decompensated cirrhosis**: Entecavir or tenofovir recommended due to favorable resistance profile. PEG IFN should not be used.
- **Liver Transplantation**: Prevention of recurrent hepatitis B achieved by **combination of short-term IV HBIG and lifelong oral entecavir, TDF, or TAF**. Newer oral agents may replace HBIG in low-risk. Lifelong combo HBIG-oral agent considered for high-risk (HDV/HBV, HIV/HBV, nonadherent). Lifelong oral agent recommended (without HBIG) for anti-HBc-positive donors.
- **HIV-HBV co-infection**: More progressive/severe HBV disease. LAM never monotherapy (HIV resistance). ADV used, no longer first-line. ETV not preferable (HIV resistance). **Tenofovir and combination tenofovir+emtricitabine excellent choices**. Treat both HBV/HIV. TAF preferable to TDF (better safety).
- **Chemotherapy/Immunosuppression**: Risk of **reactivation of hepatitis B**, often severe, occasionally fatal. Enhanced HBV replication during therapy, suppressed cellular immunity. Reactivation after drug withdrawal (rebound T-cell function). **Preemptive antiviral treatment** (newer, more potent entecavir/tenofovir preferred) reduces risk substantially. Less effective if treated after reactivation.
- Reactivation common (4-68%) in HBsAg+; less common in HBsAg-cleared but anti-HBc+ (<10%); rarely anti-HBs+/anti-HBc+ (<5%).
- **Recommend HBsAg and anti-HBc screening** for all patients undergoing such chemotherapy.
- **Preemptive antiviral prophylaxis** for HBsAg+ persons and anti-HBc+ persons treated with most potent immunomodulators (B cell-depleting agents like rituximab). Close monitoring other anti-HBc+/anti-HBs+ persons with treatment if reactivation occurs.

# Hepatitis D

## Acute Viral Hepatitis (Overview)

- Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is the **HBV-associated delta agent**.
- Requires helper function of HBV.
- Produces clinically similar illnesses to other hepatitis viruses.
- Bloodborne type associated with chronic liver disease/cirrhosis/HCC.

## Virology and Etiology

- Delta hepatitis agent, HDV, only member genus Deltavirus.
- **Defective RNA virus that co-infects with and requires the helper function of HBV** (or other hepadnaviruses) for its replication and expression.
- Slightly smaller than HBV, **35- to 37-nm virus** (Fig. 339-1). Formalin-sensitive. Hybrid structure.
- Nucleocapsid expresses **HDV antigen (HDAg)**, bears no antigenic homology with any HBV antigens. Contains virus genome.
- HDV core "encapsidated" by an outer envelope of **HBsAg**, indistinguishable from HBV HBsAg (except relative compositions).
- Genome: small (1700-nucleotide), circular, single-strand RNA of negative polarity.
- Nonhomologous with HBV DNA (except small area polymerase gene). Has features (rolling circle model of replication) common to genomes of plant satellite viruses/viroids.
- Many areas of internal complementarity, folds into stable, rod-like structure. Contains stable, self-cleaving and self-ligating ribozyme.
- Requires **host RNA polymerase II** for replication in hepatocyte nucleus via RNA-directed RNA synthesis.
- Transcribes genomic RNA to complementary antigenomic (plus strand) RNA, which serves as template for genomic RNA synthesis (effected by host RNA polymerase I).
- Only one open reading frame; **HDAg is the only known HDV protein** (product of antigenomic strand).
- HDAg exists in two forms: small (195-aa, facilitates RNA replication), large (214-aa, suppresses replication but required for assembly into virions).
- HDAg binds directly to RNA polymerase II, stimulating transcription.
- Viral assembly requires farnesylation of the large HDAg for ribonucleoprotein anchoring to HBsAg.
- Both HBV and HDV enter hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide receptor.
- Complete hepatitis D virions and liver injury require cooperative helper function of HBV.
- **Intracellular replication of HDV RNA can occur without HBV**.
- Genomic heterogeneity described. Preliminary: genotype 2 linked to milder disease, genotype 3 to severe acute disease.
- Clinical spectrum common to all eight genotypes. Predominant genotype 1.
- Reported in vitro ability to assemble infectious particles with envelope glycoproteins from other viruses raises possibility of replication without hepadnaviruses, but co-infections in nature not observed.

## Serologic and Virologic Markers

- HDV can either infect a person **simultaneously with HBV (co-infection)** or **superinfect** a person already infected with HBV (superinfection).
- Duration of HDV infection is **determined by the duration of (and cannot outlast) HBV infection**.
- HDV replication tends to **suppress HBV replication**; patients with hepatitis D tend to have lower levels of HBV replication.
- HDAg expressed primarily in hepatocyte nuclei, occasionally detectable in serum.
- During acute HDV infection, **IgM anti-HDV predominates**.
- **30–40 days may elapse after symptoms appear before anti-HDV can be detected**.
- In self-limited infection, anti-HDV is low-titer and transient, rarely detectable beyond HBsAg/HDAg clearance.
- In chronic HDV infection, **anti-HDV circulates in high titer**, and both IgM and IgG anti-HDV can be detected.
- HDAg in the liver and **HDV RNA in serum and liver** can be detected during HDV replication.

## Diagnosis

- Presence of HDV infection identified by demonstrating intrahepatic HDAg or, more practically, an **anti-HDV seroconversion** (rise in titer or de novo appearance).
- Circulating HDAg (diagnostic of acute infection) is detectable only briefly.
- Retrospective serodiagnosis of acute self-limited, simultaneous HBV/HDV difficult (anti-HDV often undetectable once HBsAg disappears).
- Early diagnosis of acute infection hampered by delay of up to 30-40 days in anti-HDV appearance.
- Patient with acute hepatitis, HBsAg, and anti-HDV in serum: IgM anti-HBc helpful.
- IgM anti-HBc: reliable indicator of recent HBV infection. Absent IgM anti-HBc: reliable indicator of remote HBV infection.
- **Simultaneous acute HBV and HDV infections: IgM anti-HBc detectable**.
- **Acute HDV superinfection on chronic HBV infection: anti-HBc is of the IgG class**.
- Assays for HDV RNA (specialized labs, not standardized) confirm infection, monitor treatment.
- Test for anti-HDV useful in HBV persons with severe/fulminant disease, severe chronic disease, chronic hepatitis B with acute exacerbations, frequent percutaneous exposures, from endemic areas.

## Pathogenesis

- Concomitant HDV and HBV infections are associated with **more severe liver injury than HBV infection alone**.
- Cells transfected in vitro with the gene for HDV antigen express HDAg and become necrotic in the absence of immunologic influences (consistent with viral effect on pathogenicity).

## Pathology

- Occasionally, **microvesicular steatosis** occurs in hepatitis D.
- Immunohistochemical studies: **HDV antigen is localized to the hepatocyte nucleus**.

## Epidemiology and Global Features

- Infection with HDV has a **worldwide distribution**.
- Two epidemiologic patterns:
    - **Endemic areas** (Mediterranean countries: northern Africa, southern Europe, Middle East): HDV infection is endemic among those with hepatitis B; transmitted predominantly by **nonpercutaneous means, especially close personal contact**.
    - **Nonendemic areas** (US, northern Europe): HDV infection is confined to persons exposed frequently to blood and blood products, primarily **injection drug users** (especially HIV-infected) and hemophiliacs.
- US prevalence (rare among chronic HBV): 0.02% NHANES 1999–2012; 0.11% NHANES 2011–2016.
- Among HBsAg-positive persons in US: prevalence highest in injection drug users (11-36%) and hemophiliacs (19%).
- HDV can be introduced into a population through drug users or migration from endemic to nonendemic areas. Patterns of population migration and human behavior facilitating percutaneous contact play important roles.
- Occasionally expressed in explosive outbreaks of severe hepatitis (e.g., Lábrea fever in Amazon basin).
- Global scale: HDV infection declined end of 1990s. Public health measures to control HBV (mass vaccination) reduced HDV prevalence in endemic areas.
- Frequency has not fallen below 1990s levels; reservoir sustained by survivors infected during 1970-1980 and recent immigrants from still-endemic areas.
- Current global prevalence estimated at **62–72 million people**.
- Of eight HDV genotypes: genotype 1 worldwide; genotypes 2/4 Far East; 3 South America; 5–8 Africa.

## Clinical and Laboratory Features

- Infection with HDV can occur in the presence of acute or chronic HBV infection.
- Duration of HBV infection determines duration of HDV infection.
- When simultaneous acute HBV and HDV occur: clinical/biochemical features may be indistinguishable from HBV alone, although occasionally more severe.
- Chronic HBV infection can support HDV replication indefinitely (acute HDV on nonresolving acute HBV or, more commonly, acute HDV superimposed on chronic HBV).
- Superinfection with HDV in chronic HBV often leads to **clinical deterioration**.
- Chronic hepatitis B plus D has similar clinical and laboratory features to chronic hepatitis B alone, **except for severity**.
- Relatively **severe and progressive chronic hepatitis**, with or without cirrhosis, is the rule; mild chronic hepatitis is the exception.
- Occasionally, mild hepatitis or even inactive carriage occurs; disease may become indolent after several years.
- Distinguishing serologic feature of chronic hepatitis D: presence of **antibodies to liver-kidney microsomes (anti-LKM)**. The species is **anti-LKM3**, directed against uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase. Distinct from anti-LKM1 (autoimmune hepatitis, subset chronic HCV).

## Prognosis

- Patients with simultaneous acute hepatitis B and D do not necessarily experience a higher mortality rate than patients with acute hepatitis B alone; **case-fatality rate was ∼5% in several outbreaks** among injection drug users.
- When **HDV superinfection occurs in a person with chronic hepatitis B**, the likelihood of **fulminant hepatitis and death is increased substantially**.
- Mortality >20% recorded in severe HDV superinfection outbreaks (Lábrea fever).
- Chronic hepatitis D: **annual rate of cirrhosis is 4%**.
- Associated with **severe liver disease**.
- Mild hepatitis/inactive carriage identified in some, disease may become indolent after early years.
- HDV superinfection transforms inactive or mild chronic hepatitis B into **severe, progressive chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis**.
- Can **accelerate the course of chronic hepatitis B** and **accelerate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma**.
- Some HDV superinfections in chronic HBV lead to **fulminant hepatitis**.
- Annual rate of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis D and cirrhosis is ∼3%. (Note: this is specific for D+ cirrhosis).

## Complications and Sequelae

- Fulminant hepatitis (massive hepatic necrosis) is a feared complication, seen primarily in hepatitis B, D, E.
- Sizable proportion of fulminant B cases associated with HDV infection.
- EMC initially reported with hepatitis B, but limited association; substantial proportion has chronic HCV.

## Treatment: Acute Viral Hepatitis

- Specific treatment generally not necessary in typical cases.
- For hepatitis D (requires HBV), treatment of severe acute hepatitis B with a nucleoside analogue has been attempted successfully (anecdotal).
- Physical isolation rarely necessary, except for uncontrolled bleeding.
- Emphasis on blood precautions. Enteric precautions unnecessary.
- Hand washing important. Universal precautions apply.
- Fulminant hepatitis: goal is support, anticipation of regeneration/repair. Liver transplantation may be lifesaving.

## Prophylaxis

- Prevention of infection with HDV can be achieved by **vaccinating susceptible persons with hepatitis B vaccine**.
- **No product is available for immunoprophylaxis to prevent HDV superinfection** in persons with chronic HBV infection.
- For chronic HBV patients, recommended: avoidance of percutaneous exposures and limitation of intimate contact with persons who have HDV infection.

## Treatment: Chronic Hepatitis D

- Management is **not well defined**.
- Host cellular RNA polymerase (upon which HDV replication depends) cannot be targeted by conventional antiviral agents.
- **Glucocorticoids are ineffective**.
- Preliminary experimental trials of IFN-α suggested transient reduction HDV RNA/ALT but no impact on natural history.
- **High-dose IFN-α** (9 million units three times a week) for 12 months reported associated with sustained loss of HDV replication and clinical improvement in up to 50%. Beneficial impact persisted 15 years, associated with reduced histology grade/stage, cleared HDV RNA in some.
- Suggested approach: high-dose, long-term IFN for at least a year, extend until HDV RNA/HBsAg clearance in responders. Extension to 2nd year provided no advantage, sustained responses after completion rare.
- **Standard IFN-α is the only approved drug for hepatitis D**.
- **PEG IFN** shown more effective than standard, but still of **limited therapeutic value**. After 48 weeks: durable undetectable HDV RNA (24 weeks posttreatment) in a quarter to just over a half.
- Loss of virologic responses observed during long-term monitoring in majority; durable suppression to undetectable in only 12%.
- Extending PEG IFN to 5 years/high dose: achieved improvement, but SVRs in only 3 patients (small trial).
- **None of the nucleoside analogue antiviral agents for hepatitis B is effective in hepatitis D**. Adding oral nucleoside agents to PEG IFN no more effective than PEG IFN monotherapy.
- Recommended 12 months of PEG IFN therapy is **far from satisfactory**.
- Experimental approaches include:
    - Oral prenylation inhibitor **lonafarnib**: reduced HDV RNA transiently in small trial, rebounded after therapy.
    - Inhibitor of HBV/HDV viral entry **myrcludex B**: reduced HDV RNA in small trial as mono or with PEG IFN, but no change in HBsAg. Sustained responses not achieved.
    - Nucleic acid polymer therapy (inhibits HBsAg release): promising reductions in HDV RNA/HBsAg in some studies, but adverse effects (ALT elevations).
    - PEG IFN lambda: modest on-treatment reductions in HDV RNA, associated with IFN side effects/lab elevations.
    - Follow-up studies frustratingly slow.
- Patients with end-stage liver disease secondary to chronic hepatitis D: **liver transplantation has been effective**.
- If hepatitis D recurs in new liver without hepatitis B expression (unusual in immunocompetent): liver injury limited.
- Outcome of transplantation for chronic hepatitis D is superior to that for chronic hepatitis B.
- Combination HBIG and nucleoside analogue therapy for hepatitis B is indicated in such transplant patients.

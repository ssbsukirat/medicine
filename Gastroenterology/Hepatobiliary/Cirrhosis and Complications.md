* condition that is defined histopathologically and has a variety of clinical manifestations and complications, some of which can be life-threatening 
* earlier thought to be irreversible but now understood that removing insult may reverse fibrosis 
* architectural distortion with the formation of regenerative nodules 
* reduced hepatocellular mass + function and altered blood flow 
* Fibrosis 
	* activation of hepatic stellate cells 
	* increased collagen and extracellular matrix 
* clinical feature mirror severity of disease 
* Staging 
	* varies by disease 
	* Stage 3
		* bridging fibrosis with nodularity 
	* Stage 4 
		* cirrhosis 
* Decompensation if 
	* ascites  (due to PHTN)
	* variceal bleed (due to PHTN)
	* hepatic encephalopathy 
* consider transplant in decompensation especially if poorly controlled
* reduced hepatocellular function 
	* jaundice 
	* coagulation disorders 
	* hypoalbuminemia 
	* contributes to portosystemic encephalopathy

# Alcohol-associated Cirrhosis 
* may cause CLD (AFLD, hepatitis and cirrhosis )
* may worsen damage in other liver disease like Hepatitis C, hemochromatosis or NAFLD 
* fibrossi+/- inflammation or necrosis 
* Micronodular  (nodules <3mm) but maybe mixed with cessation of alcohol 
## Pathogenesis 
* Ethanol absorbed by small intestine and stomach (less)
* Gastric Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) initiates metabolism 
* Metabolic enzyme systems 
	* Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)
		* using inducible P450 CYP2E1 
	* ADH 
	* Peroxisomal catalase 
* Majority of alcohol to ***acetaldehyde*** by ADH (also MEOS produces ROSs and further acetaldehyde)
	* reactive molecule 
	* to Acetate by ALDH (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase)
* ethanol increases intracellular triglycerides by 
	* increasing fatty acid uptake
	* reducing fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein secretion 
* Protein synthesis , glycosylation and secretion impaired 
* Effects of acetaldehyde 
	* Oxidative damage to hepatocyte membranes due to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs)
	* highly reactive --> combines with proteins and nucleic acids to form acetaldehyde adducts
	* Adducts interfere with microtubular formation and hepatic protwin trafficking 
	* May activate Kupffer cell by ROSs causing profibrogenic cytokines and

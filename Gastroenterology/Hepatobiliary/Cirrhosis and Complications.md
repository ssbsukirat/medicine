* condition that is defined histopathologically and has a variety of clinical manifestations and complications, some of which can be life-threatening 
* earlier thought to be irreversible but now understood that removing insult may reverse fibrosis 
* architectural distortion with the formation of regenerative nodules 
* reduced hepatocellular mass + function and altered blood flow 
* Fibrosis 
	* activation of hepatic stellate cells 
	* increased collagen and extracellular matrix 
* clinical feature mirror severity of disease 
* Staging 
	* varies by disease 
	* Stage 3
		* bridging fibrosis with nodularity 
	* Stage 4 
		* cirrhosis 
* Decompensation if 
	* ascites  (due to PHTN)
	* variceal bleed (due to PHTN)
	* hepatic encephalopathy 
* consider transplant in decompensation especially if poorly controlled
* reduced hepatocellular function 
	* jaundice 
	* coagulation disorders 
	* hypoalbuminemia 
	* contributes to portosystemic encephalopathy

# Alcohol-associated Cirrhosis 
* may cause CLD (AFLD, hepatitis and cirrhosis )
* may worsen damage in other liver disease like Hepatitis C, hemochromatosis or NAFLD 
* fibrossi+/- inflammation or necrosis 
* Micronodular  (nodules <3mm) but maybe mixed with cessation of alcohol 
## Pathogenesis 
* Ethanol absorbed by small intestine and stomach (less)
* Gastric Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) initiates metabolism 
* Metabolic enzyme systems 
	* Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)
		* using inducible P450 CYP2E1 
	* ADH 
	* Peroxisomal catalase 
* Majority of alcohol to ***acetaldehyde*** by ADH (also MEOS produces ROSs and further acetaldehyde)
	* reactive molecule 
	* to Acetate by ALDH (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase)
* ethanol increases intracellular triglycerides by 
	* increasing fatty acid uptake
	* reducing fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein secretion 
* Protein synthesis , glycosylation and secretion impaired 
* Effects of acetaldehyde 
	* Oxidative damage to hepatocyte membranes due to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs)
	* highly reactive --> combines with proteins and nucleic acids to form acetaldehyde adducts
	* Adducts interfere with microtubular formation and hepatic protwin trafficking 
	* May activate Kupffer cell by ROSs causing profibrogenic cytokines and stellate cell activation 
* production of excess collagen and extracellular matrix.
	* in both ***periportal and pericentral*** zones
	* eventually connects portal triads with central veins forming regenerative nodules
## Clinical feature 
* history of amount and duration of consumption 
* Nonspecific symptoms 
	* vague RUQ pain 
	* Fever 
	* Nausea / Vomiting 
	* Diarrhea 
	* Anorexia 
	* malaise 
* Specific complication 
	* Ascites 
	* edema 
	* Upper GI bleed 
	* Jaundice 
	* encephalopathy 
* Physical 
	* liver spleen maybe enlarged
	* liver edge firm and nodular 
	* scleral icterus 
	* palmar erythema 
	* spider angiomas 
	* parotid enlargement 
	* digital clubbing 
	* muscle wasting 
	* edema 
	* ascites
	* Men 
		* reduced body hair 
		* gynecomastia 
		* testicular atrophy 
	* Women 
		* amenorrhea 
	* changes usually reversible 
* Labs 
	* early maybe complete normal 
	* Advanced 
		* Anemia from 
			* chronic GI loss,
			* nutrition or
			* hypersplenism or
			* direct myelosuppression by alcohol 
		* Zieves syndrome 
			* Hemolytic anemia 
			* spur cells and acanthocytes 
			* in severe alcoholic hepatitis 
	* low platelet counts due to portal hypertension and hypersplenism 
	* normal or elevated bilirubin 
	* PT elevated does not respond to vitamin K 
	* Na usually normal unless ascites (then low)
	* AST ALT elevated with AST/ALT >2:1 
## Diagnosis 
* Clinical or physical or Labs 
* requires continue or recent alcohol history 
* rule out other CLD causes 
* Liver biopsy only if alternate diagnosis suspect 
* <50% survival 5-year if complication with continued drinking 
## Treatment 
* Abstinence 
* Nutrition support and medical supervision 
* manage complication 
	* asictes 
	* edema 
	* variceal 
	* portosystemic encephalopathy 
* transplant 
* Glucocorticoid 
	* in severe alcoholic hepatitis without infections 
	* Discriminant fraction >32 (serum)

# Alcohol-associated Cirrhosis 
* may cause CLD (AFLD, hepatitis and cirrhosis )
* may worsen damage in other liver disease like Hepatitis C, hemochromatosis or NAFLD 
* fibrossi+/- inflammation or necrosis 
* Micronodular  (nodules <3mm) but maybe mixed with cessation of alcohol 
## Pathogenesis 
* Ethanol absorbed by small intestine and stomach (less)
* Gastric Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) initiates metabolism 
* Metabolic enzyme systems 
	* Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)
		* using inducible P450 CYP2E1 
	* ADH 
	* Peroxisomal catalase 
* Majority of alcohol to ***acetaldehyde*** by ADH (also MEOS produces ROSs and further acetaldehyde)
	* reactive molecule 
	* to Acetate by ALDH (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase)
* ethanol increases intracellular triglycerides by 
	* increasing fatty acid uptake
	* reducing fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein secretion 
* Protein synthesis , glycosylation and secretion impaired 
* Effects of acetaldehyde 
	* Oxidative damage to hepatocyte membranes due to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs)
	* highly reactive --> combines with proteins and nucleic acids to form acetaldehyde adducts
	* Adducts interfere with microtubular formation and hepatic protwin trafficking 
	* May activate Kupffer cell by ROSs causing profibrogenic cytokines and stellate cell activation 
* production of excess collagen and extracellular matrix.
	* in both ***periportal and pericentral*** zones
	* eventually connects portal triads with central veins forming regenerative nodules

# Autoimmune and NAFLD cirrhosis 
* AIH may present with established cirrhosis 
	* no benefit to immunosuppresants (glucocorticoids or azathioprine ) as AIH maybe "burned out"
	* biopsy doesnt show significant inflammatory infiltrates 
	* diagnosis requires ANA or ASMA (anti-smooth muscle antibody )
	* if cirrhosis + active inflammation + elevated enzymes 
		* glucocorticoids or azathioprine useful 
* NASH 
	* obesity 
	* cryptogenic cirrhosis maybe NASH 
	* as cirrhosis progresses, ***catabolic state so loss of steatosis on biopsy*** 
# Biliary Cirrhosis 
* different pathology from alcohol or posthepatic but clinically similar 
* cholestatic liver disease due to 
	* necroinflammatory lesions 
	* congenital or metabolic process 
	* external bile duct compression 
* Intrahepatic vs extra-
	* extrahepatic may benefit from surgical decompression or endoscopy 
* includes 
	* primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), 
	* autoimmune cholangitis (AIC), 
	* primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),
	* idiopathic adulthood ductopenia
* Cholestatic on histology 
	* cholate stasis; 
	* copper deposition; 
	* xanthomatous transformation of hepatocytes; 
	* irregular, so-called biliary fibrosis.
	* chronic portal inflammation, 
	* interface activity,
	* chronic lobular inflammation. 
	* Ductopenia due to  progressive disease to cirrhosis.
## Primary Biliary Cholangitis 
* 100-200 per million 
* female ~ 50 years age 
* unknown cause 
* portal inflammation + necrosis of cholangiocytes in small-medium bile ducts 
* cholestatic picture 
	* elevated Bilirubin 
	* progressive liver failure 
* liver transplant in decompensation 
* UDCA slows progression so 1st line 
* AMA ++ in 95% 
	* non pathogenic 
	* diagnostic 
	* recognize lipoic acid on the inner mitochondrial membrane proteins that are enzymes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), the branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex, and the 2-oxogluterate dehydrogenase complex
* Pathology 
	* four distinct stages of the disease as it progresses. 
		* The earliest lesion --> 
			* ***chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis***
			* necrotizing inflammatory process of the portal tracts. 
			* Medium and small bile ducts are infiltrated with lymphocytes and undergo duct destruction
			* Mild fibrosis and sometimes bile stasis can occur. 
		* With progression, 
			* the inflammatory infiltrate becomes less prominent,
			* the number of bile ducts is reduced 
			* proliferation of smaller bile ductules. 
		* Increased fibrosis 
			* expansion of periportal fibrosis to bridging fibrosis.
		* Finally, cirrhosis, which may be micronodular or macronodular, develops.
* Clinical feature 
	* middle- aged women 
	* diagnosed well before the end-stage manifestations 
	* most patients are asymptomatic
	* fatigue out of proportion to either the severity of the liver disease or the age of the patient. 
	* Pruritus
		* is seen in ~50% of patients at the time of diagnosis,
		* debilitating
		* intermittent and most bothersome in the ***evening***.
		* pruritus may develop toward the end of pregnancy (maybe mistaken for cholestasis of pregnancy)
		* Pruritus that presents prior to the development of jaundice indicates severe disease and a poor prognosis 
	* Physical 
		* jaundice and other complications of chronic liver disease including hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, and edema. 
		* features unique to PBC 
			* hyperpigmentation 
				* evident on the trunk and arms 
				* in areas of exfoliation and lichenification associated with progressive scratching related to the pruritus.
			* xanthelasma
			* xanthomata (due to altered cholesterol metabolism )
			* Bone pain resulting from osteopenia or osteoporosis
* Labs 
	* cholestatic 
		* elevation in γ-glutamyl trans- peptidase and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
		* mild elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and AST) 
	* IgM increased 
	* hyperbilirubinemia 
	* thrombocytopenia , anemia, leukopenia 
	* biopsy 
	* maybe similar to AIH treated as "overlap " in 10% 
* Diagnosis 
	* consider if chronic cholestatic findings 
	* AMA negative in 5-10% 
		* biopsy most important 
		* if cholestatic + --> ***cholangiography*** to rule out PSC 
	* PBC-specific 
		* sp100 
		* gp120 
* Treatment 
	* UDCA improve labs and histology 
		* best to start early 
		* less improvement if cirrhosis ++ 
		* 13-15 mg/kg/day 
		* may worsen pruritus initially 
		* if response not enough (30-40%)
			* significant improvement with ***obeticholic*** acid
	* transplant if decompensation 
	* pruritus 
		* antihistamines 
		* narcotic antagonists (naltrexone)
		* rifampin 
		* Cholestyramine,
			* a bile salt–sequestering agent, 
			* helpful in some patients
			* tedious and difficult to take.
		* plasmapheresis if severe and intractable 
	* bone density testing 
		* oral calcium and vitamin D 
		* bisphosphonate if bone disease + 
## Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis 
* cause of PSC remains unknown
* PSC is a chronic cholestatic syndrome 
* diffuse inflammation and fibrosis involving the entire biliary tree, resulting in chronic cholestasis.
* ultimately results in obliteration of both the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree,
	* leading to biliary cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and liver failure.
* Biopsy is not pathognomic 
	* bile duct proliferation
	* ductopenia 
	* fibrous cholangitis (pericholangitis). 
	* Periductal fibrosis
* biliary tree imaging required 
### Clinical feature 
* cholestatic liver disease, 
	* with fatigue, pruritus, steatorrhea, deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins
* Pruritus is profound and nonspecific 
### Labs 
* during an evaluation of abnormal liver enzymes.
* at least a twofold increase in ALP and may have elevated aminotransferases as well
* Albumin levels may be decreased
* prothrombin times are prolonged 
	* Some degree of correction may occur with parenteral vitamin K
* aminotransferase elevations >5× the upper limit of normal and may have features of AIH on biopsy indicating an ***overlap syndrome*** between PSC and AIH.
* antibody 
	* positive in overlap 
	* negative in PSC 
	* pANCA in 65% 
* IBD in 60-80% 
	* Ulcerative colitis 
	* ***Colonoscopy at diagnosis***
### Diagnosis 
* requires cholangiography 
* ***Imaging of choice*** magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (***MRCP***)
* ERCP if 
	* MRCP suboptimal 
	* clinical (newly elevated total bilirubin or worsening pruritus) or MRCP evidence of a ***dominant stricture***
* cholangiography 
	* multifocal stricturing and beading involving both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree.
	* strictures typically short and with intervening segments of normal or slightly dilated bile ducts that are distributed diffusely, producing the classic beaded appearance
### Treatment 
* no treatment 
* some use UDCA at 13-15 mg/kg 
* high dose UDCA harmful 
* endoscopy dilatation of strictures 
* ultimately transplant 
* cholangiocarcinoma may develop 
	* relative contraindication to transplant 
## Cardiac Cirrhosis 
* long-standing right-sided congestive heart failure may develop chronic liver injury and cardiac cirrhosis 
* elevated venous pressure transmitted via the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins to the sinusoids of the liver, 
	* become dilated and engorged with blood
	* liver becomes enlarged and swollen,
	* long-term passive congestion and relative ischemia due to poor circulation, 
	* centrilobular hepatocytes can become necrotic, leading to ***pericentral*** fibrosis
* Cli

* condition that is defined histopathologically and has a variety of clinical manifestations and complications, some of which can be life-threatening 
* earlier thought to be irreversible but now understood that removing insult may reverse fibrosis 
* architectural distortion with the formation of regenerative nodules 
* reduced hepatocellular mass + function and altered blood flow 
* Fibrosis 
	* activation of hepatic stellate cells 
	* increased collagen and extracellular matrix 
* clinical feature mirror severity of disease 
* Staging 
	* varies by disease 
	* Stage 3
		* bridging fibrosis with nodularity 
	* Stage 4 
		* cirrhosis 
* Decompensation if 
	* ascites  (due to PHTN)
	* variceal bleed (due to PHTN)
	* hepatic encephalopathy 
* consider transplant in decompensation especially if poorly controlled
* reduced hepatocellular function 
	* jaundice 
	* coagulation disorders 
	* hypoalbuminemia 
	* contributes to portosystemic encephalopathy

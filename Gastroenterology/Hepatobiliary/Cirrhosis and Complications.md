* condition that is defined histopathologically and has a variety of clinical manifestations and complications, some of which can be life-threatening 
* earlier thought to be irreversible but now understood that removing insult may reverse fibrosis

# Alcohol-associated Cirrhosis 
* may cause CLD (AFLD, hepatitis and cirrhosis )
* may worsen damage in other liver disease like Hepatitis C, hemochromatosis or NAFLD 
* fibrossi+/- inflammation or necrosis 
* Micronodular  (nodules <3mm) but maybe mixed with cessation of alcohol 
## Pathogenesis 
* Ethanol absorbed by small intestine and stomach (less)
* Gastric Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) initiates metabolism 
* Metabolic enzyme systems 
	* Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS)
		* using inducible P450 CYP2E1 
	* ADH 
	* Peroxisomal catalase 
* Majority of alcohol to ***acetaldehyde*** by ADH (also MEOS produces ROSs and further acetaldehyde)
	* reactive molecule 
	* to Acetate by ALDH (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase)
* ethanol increases intracellular triglycerides by 
	* increasing fatty acid uptake
	* reducing fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein secretion 
* Protein synthesis , glycosylation and secretion impaired 
* Effects of acetaldehyde 
	* Oxidative damage to hepatocyte membranes due to formation of reactive oxygen species (ROSs)
	* highly reactive --> combines with proteins and nucleic acids to form acetaldehyde adducts
	* Adducts interfere with microtubular formation and hepatic protwin trafficking 
	* May activate Kupffer cell by ROSs causing profibrogenic cytokines and stellate cell activation 
* production of excess collagen and extracellular matrix.
	* in both ***periportal and pericentral*** zones
	* eventually connects portal triads with central veins forming regenerative nodules

## Diagnosis 
* Clinical or physical or Labs

# Hepatitis C 
* 80% develop chronic hep c 
* 20-30% of those develop cirh'over 20-30 years 
* Concomitant alcohol use + 
* HCV is ***non cytopathic*** virus, ***causes Immune-mediated liver damage*** 
* Portal based fibrosis with bridging fibrosis and nodularity --> cirrhosis 
* small and shrunken liver 
* mixed macronodular and micronodular 
* inflammatory infiltrates in portal areas + interface hepatitis +/- lobar hepatocellular injury 
* similar in ***Hep B***
	* 5% develop chronic HBV 
	* 20% of chronic have cirrhosis

# Autoimmune and NAFLD cirrhosis 
* AIH may present with established cirrhosis 
	* no benefit to immunosuppresants (glucocorticoids or azathioprine ) as AIH maybe "burned out"
	* biopsy doesnt show significant inflammatory infiltrates 
	* diagnosis requires ANA or ASMA (anti-smooth muscle antibody )
	* if cirrhosis + active inflammation + elevated enzymes 
		* glucocorticoids or azathioprine useful 
* NASH 
	* obesity 
	* cryptogenic cirrhosis maybe NASH 
	* as cirrhosis progresses, ***catabolic state so loss of steatosis on biopsy*** 
# Biliary Cirrhosis 
* different pathology from alcohol or posthepatic but clinically similar 
* cholestatic liver disease due to 
	* necroinflammatory lesions 
	* congenital or metabolic process 
	* external bile duct compression 
* Intrahepatic vs extra-
	* extrahepatic may benefit from surgical decompression or endoscopy 
* includes 
	* primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), 
	* autoimmune cholangitis (AIC), 
	* primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),
	* idiopathic adulthood ductopenia
* Cholestatic on histology 
	* cholate stasis; 
	* copper deposition; 
	* xanthomatous transformation of hepatocytes; 
	* irregular, so-called biliary fibrosis.
	* chronic portal inflammation, 
	* interface activity,
	* chronic lobular inflammation. 
	* Ductopenia due to  progressive disease to cirrhosis.
## Primary Biliary Cholangitis 
* 100-200 per million 
* female ~ 50 years age 
* unknown cause 
* portal inflammation + necrosis of cholangiocytes in small-medium bile ducts 
* cholestatic picture 
	* elevated Bilirubin 
	* progressive liver failure 
* liver transplant in decompensation 
* UDCA slows progression so 1st line 
* AMA ++ in 95% 
	* non pathogenic 
	* diagnostic 
	* recognize lipoic acid on the inner mitochondrial membrane proteins that are enzymes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), the branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex, and the 2-oxogluterate dehydrogenase complex
* Pathology 
	* four distinct stages of the disease as it progresses. 
		* The earliest lesion --> 
			* ***chronic nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis***
			* necrotizing inflammatory process of the portal tracts. 
			* Medium and small bile ducts are infiltrated with lymphocytes and undergo duct destruction
			* Mild fibrosis and sometimes bile stasis can occur. 
		* With progression, 
			* the inflammatory infiltrate becomes less prominent,
			* the number of bile ducts is reduced 
			* proliferation of smaller bile ductules. 
		* Increased fibrosis 
			* expansion of periportal fibrosis to bridging fibrosis.
		* Finally, cirrhosis, which may be micronodular or macronodular, develops.
* Clinical feature 
	* middle- aged women 
	* diagnosed well before the end-stage manifestations 
	* most patients are asymptomatic
	* fatigue out of proportion to either the severity of the liver disease or the age of the patient. 
	* Pruritus
		* is seen in ~50% of patients at the time of diagnosis,
		* debilitating
		* intermittent and most bothersome in the ***evening***.
		* pruritus may develop toward the end of pregnancy (maybe mistaken for cholestasis of pregnancy)
		* Pruritus that presents prior to the development of jaundice indicates severe disease and a poor prognosis 
	* Physical 
		* jaundice and other complications of chronic liver disease including hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, and edema. 
		* features unique to PBC 
			* hyperpigmentation 
				* evident on the trunk and arms 
				* in areas of exfoliation and lichenification associated with progressive scratching related to the pruritus.
			* xanthelasma
			* xanthomata (due to altered cholesterol metabolism )
			* Bone pain resulting from osteopenia or osteoporosis
* Labs 
	* cholestatic 
		* elevation in γ-glutamyl trans- peptidase and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
		* mild elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and AST) 
	* IgM increased 
	* hyperbilirubinemia 
	* thrombocytopenia , anemia, leukopenia 
	* biopsy

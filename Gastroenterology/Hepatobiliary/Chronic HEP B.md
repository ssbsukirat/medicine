![[Acute Viral Hepatitis#hepatitis B]]
- likelihood of Chronicity is function of age 
- At birth associated with clinically silent acute infection but 90% chronic
- Young adulthood has more acute and 1% chronic
- Most chronic HBV has no past detectable acute episode
- Adults with chronic HBV-- histology is prognostic
- HBV replication more important than histology only as it correlate with level of injury and risk of progress
- Phases in HbeAg reactive
	- Replicative phase
		- HbeAg and HBV DNA greater than  10^3-4 sometimes 10^9 
		- Detectable intrahepatocyte nucleocapsid antigen (HbcAg)
		- High infectivity
		- Higher liver injury
		- May not always correlate with injury like in childhood acquired HBV there is some tolerance but later in life tolerance reduces and reactivation may occur 
	- nonreplicative phase
		- Absent HbeAg
		- Anti-hbe
		- Low HBV 
		- Absent intrahepatocyte HbcAg
		- Low infectivity
		- Minimal liver injury
- HbeAg non reactive
	- Core or precore mutant
	- Activity correlate to HBV DNA levels 
	- Easier to suppress DNA levels 
	- Sustained response difficult to achieve
- Clinical spectrum
	- Fatigue
		- Common 
		- Persistent 
	- Jaundice
		- Common in severe or advanced
	- Intermittent worsening of jaundice with maalise and anorexia similar to acute hepatitis with reactivation and may cause decompensation
	- Extrahepatic manifestation similar to acute hep B [[Acute Viral Hepatitis]]

![[Acute Viral Hepatitis#hepatitis B]]
- likelihood of Chronicity is function of age 
- At birth associated with clinically silent acute infection but 90% chronic
- Young adulthood has more acute and 1% chronic
- Most chronic HBV has no past detectable acute episode
- Adults with chronic HBV-- histology is prognostic
- HBV replication more important than histology only as it correlate with level of injury and risk of progress
- Phases in HbeAg reactive
	- Replicative phase
		- HbeAg and HBV DNA greater than  10^3-4 sometimes 10^9 
		- Detectable intrahepatocyte nucleocapsid antigen (HbcAg)
		- High infectivity
		- Higher liver injury
	- nonreplicative phase
		- Absent HbeAg
		- Anti-hbe
		- Low HBV 
		- Absent intrahepatocyte HbcAg
		- Low infectivity
		- Minimal liver injury

* liver predominantly but ***systemic infection***
* one of 
	* HAV 
	* ***HBV --> only DNA amongst*** 
	* HCV 
	* HBV-associated delta agent or hepatitis D virus (HDV)
	* HEV 
* HBV 
	* only DNA 
	* replicates like a ***retrovirus*** 
* spectrum 
	* asymptomatic and inapparent
	* fulminant and fatal acute infections 
	* subclinical persistent infections to 
	* rapidly progressive chronic liver disease with cirrhosis 
	* hepatocellular carcinoma
# Hepatitis A 
* nonenveloped 27-nm 
    * Quasi-enveloped particles enclosed in plasma derived membrane circulate 
* heat-, acid-, and ether- resistant, 
* single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus
* Hepatovirus genus of the ***picornavirus*** family
* Virion 
    * 4 structural VP1-4 for capsid 
    * 6 nonstructural proteins 
* Inactivation of activity by 
    * boiling for 1 min 
    * Formaldehyde and chlorine 
    * UV irradiation
* IP of 3-4 weeks
* Replication in liver only but 
    * seen in liver bile stools and blood also 
    * ***Reduced in all except liver once jaundice sets in*** (also infectivity)
    * RNA maybe detected by PCR months in low levels in stool blood liver
    * PCR levels do not correlate with infectivity
* ***Anti-hav*** can be detected during acute illness with ***elevated transaminases*** 
    * IgM initially (3 months) upto 6/12 month
    * IgG during convalescence
    * IgG once established gives lifelong immunity

# hepatitis B 
* DNA virus
* Compact structure
* Only 3200bp encode for 4 viral products
* 4 overlapping genes - S C P & X
* Hepadnavirus family
* Hepatocyte entry mediated by binding to sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide receptor
* Reverse transcription of minus strand DNA from ***pregenomic RNA***
* Proteins
    * 22nm spherical or filamentous most common form which is similar to HBsAg 
    * 42nm double shelled spheres are intact HBV virion 
    * Upstream of S gene is pre-S genes 
    * HBsAg (major protein) and pre-S2 is ***middle protein*** and middle protein + pre-S1 is ***large protein***
    * Nucleocapsid core by C gene 
    * HbeAg is soluble nonparticulate nucleocapsid protein (made by C gene but different from HbcAg)
    * Translation at C gives HbcAg while precore region translation gives HbeAg
* HbeAg 
	* Marker of HBV replication and infectivity
	* Qualitative
	* If present with HBsAg more like to be Highly infectious and have HBV virion
	* If mothers HbeAg positive alongwith HBsAg then >90% transmission to child 
	* If persists after acute infection after 3 months then predicts chronic infection
	* P gene codes for polymerase both DNA dependent DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase
	* X gene makes HbxAg which transactivates both cellular and viral gene transcription
* Serological markers
	* HBsAg first marker between 8-12 (1-12weeks) 
	* HBsAg detectable before transaminase activity and symptoms by 2-6 weeks and elevated through entire icteric period
	* Undetectable after 1-2 months 
	* Anti-hbsag once detectable stays indefinitely and protective
	* HbcAg
		* Intracellular
		* In serum surrounded by HBsAg coat so not routinely detected
	* Anti-hbc is detectable 1-3 weeks after HBsAg and precedes anti-hbsag by weeks to months IgM in first 6 months then IgG
	* There is "gap period" between HBsAg disappeared and Anti-hbsag present so anti-hbc maybe the only detectable antibody then 
	* Isolated anti-hbc represent HBV infection in remote past 
	* HbeAg usually in combination with HBsAg
	* HbeAg temporally associated with high replication and detectable HBV DNA

* liver predominantly but ***systemic infection***
* one of 
	* HAV 
	* ***HBV --> only DNA amongst*** 
	* HCV 
	* HBV-associated delta agent or hepatitis D virus (HDV)
	* HEV 
* HBV 
	* only DNA 
	* replicates like a ***retrovirus*** 
* spectrum 
	* asymptomatic and inapparent
	* fulminant and fatal acute infections 
	* subclinical persistent infections to 
	* rapidly progressive chronic liver disease with cirrhosis 
	* hepatocellular carcinoma
# Hepatitis A 
* nonenveloped 27-nm 
    * Quasi-enveloped particles enclosed in plasma derived membrane circulate 
* heat-, acid-, and ether- resistant, 
* single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus
* Hepatovirus genus of the ***picornavirus*** family
* Virion 
    * 4 structural VP1-4 for capsid 
    * 6 nonstructural proteins 
* Inactivation of activity by 
    * boiling for 1 min 
    * Formaldehyde and chlorine 
    * UV irradiation
* IP of 3-4 weeks
* Replication in liver only but 
    * seen in liver bile stools and blood also 
    * ***Reduced in all except liver once jaundice sets in*** (also infectivity)
    * RNA maybe detected by PCR months in low levels in stool blood liver
    * PCR levels do not correlate with infectivity
* ***Anti-hav*** can be detected during acute illness with ***elevated transaminases*** 
    * IgM initially (3 months) upto 6/12 month
    * IgG during convalescence
    * IgG once established gives lifelong immunity

# hepatitis B 
* DNA virus
* Compact structure
* Only 3200bp encode for 4 viral products
* 4 overlapping genes - S C P & X
* Hepadnavirus family
* Hepatocyte entry mediated by binding to sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide receptor
* Reverse transcription of minus strand DNA from ***pregenomic RNA***
* Proteins
    * 22nm spherical or filamentous most common form which is similar to HBsAg 
    * 42nm double shelled spheres are intact HBV virion 
    * Upstream of S gene is pre-S genes 
    * HBsAg (major protein) and pre-S2 is ***middle protein*** and middle protein + pre-S1 is ***large protein***
    * Nucleocapsid core by C gene 
    * HbeAg is soluble nonparticulate nucleocapsid protein (made by C gene but different from HbcAg)
    * Translation at C gives HbcAg while precore region translation gives HbeAg
* HbeAg 
	* Marker of HBV replication and infectivity
	* Qualitative
	* If present with HBsAg more like to be Highly infectious and have HBV virion
	* If mothers HbeAg positive alongwith HBsAg then >90% transmission to child 
	* If persists after acute infection after 3 months then predicts chronic infection
	* P gene codes for polymerase both DNA dependent DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase
	* X gene makes HbxAg which transactivates both cellular and viral gene transcription
* Serological markers
	* HBsAg first marker between 8-12 (1-12weeks) 
	* HBsAg detectable before transaminase activity and symptoms by 2-6 weeks and elevated through entire icteric period
	* Undetectable after 1-2 months 
	* Anti-hbsag once detectable stays indefinitely and protective
	* HbcAg
		* Intracellular
		* In serum surrounded by HBsAg coat so not routinely detected
	* Anti-hbc is detectable 1-3 weeks after HBsAg and precedes anti-hbsag by weeks to months IgM in first 6 months then IgG
	* There is "gap period" between HBsAg disappeared and Anti-hbsag present so anti-hbc maybe the only detectable antibody then 
	* Isolated anti-hbc represent HBV infection in remote past 
	* HbeAg usually in combination with HBsAg
	* HbeAg temporally associated with high replication and detectable HBV DNA
	* Chronic HBV
		* IgG HbcAg, HBsAg beyond 6 months and undetectable or low anti-hbsag
		* Early chronic has HBV DNA in hepatocyte and serum 
		* In non replicative phase , ***seroconversion*** from HbeAg to anti-hbe 
		* Seroconversion may have mild transient acute hepatitis like transamnitis due to cell mediated clearance of infected hepatocyte
		* Intact virions do not circulate, only spherical and tubular forms 
* Molecular variants
	* Precore mutant
		* Mediterranean
		* Anti-hbe but no HbeAg
		* Cannot encode HbeAg 
		* Single base substitute from G to A at site 1896 
		* Tryptophan to stop codon
		* Lower levels of HBV DNA usually
	* Core-promoter mutant
		* No transcription of HbeAg region 
		* Severe liver disease 
		* Rapid progress to cirrhosis
	* Escape mutants
		* Glycine to arginine at 145 of alpha determinants in HBsAg
		* Loss of neutralising activity by anti-hbsag 
		* In immunisation, favours evolutionary change to this type 
* Extrahepatic sites 
	* Lymph nodes
	* Bone marrow
	* Lymphos 
	* Spleen 
	* Pancreas 
	* May recur after liver transplantation due to these sites 
* Pathogenesis
	* Inactive carriers with normal liver exists, suggesting **no direct cytopathic activity**
	* Cellular response involved in pathogenesis
	* Cytotoxic T cells sensitised to both host and HBV antigen on hepatocyte surface
	* Innate immune response (NK cells) and inflammatory cytokines remove HBV from cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocyte
	* Sometimes rapid liver injury may develop even after transplant suggests immune response involved in pathogenesis (Fibrosing Cholestatic hepatitis )
	* Immunotolerant chronic hepatitis B 
		* In endemic areas
		* Acquired at birth
		* High level of immune tolerance to HBV so active hepatitis not seen 
		* But invariably chronic hepatitis B seen 
		* Neonatal acquired culminates in cirrhosis or HCC few decades later 
		* Adult onset usually has low rates of HCC
		* Immunoreactive phase may occur late in life with tolerance present but liver injury and progressive fibrosis occur 
* Extrahepatic manifestation
	* Immune complex mediated tissue damage 
	* Prodromal serum sickness like in acute HBV due to immune complex deposit in blood vessel wall and complement activation
	* Glomerulonephritis with nephrotic syndrome
	* Vasculitis (PAN or polyarteritis nodosa) 
		* in 1% but >30% with PAN have chronic HBV
		* Small and medium vessels
		* HBsAg IGs and complement in vessel wall
	* Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC)
		* More in HCV than HBV 
		* Arthritis, palpable purpura and glomerulonephritis occasionally
		* Circulating cryoprecipitatable immune complex of multiple ig classes 
* Pathology (Common to most viral hepatitis)
	* Panlobular infiltration with mononuclear cell
	* Hepatic cell necrosis
	* Kupffer cell hyperplasia
	* Cholestasis
	* "Rosette" or "pseudoacinar" formation due to cell regeneration
	* Ballooning and acidophilic degeneration aka "***Councilman bodies" or apoptotic bodies***
	* Ground glass appearance in chronic
	* Bridging hepatic necrosis or subacute or confluent necrosis or interface hepatitis
		* Severe histological lesion 
		* In acute infection
		* Bridging between lobules due to cell dropout and collapse of framework 
		* Earlier thought to be poor prognosis but not recognised now 
	* ***Massive hepatic necrosis or acute yellow atrophy*** has fulminant course and soft shrunken liver in autopsy
	* HBsAg in Cytoplasm and membrane
	* HbcAg in nucleus or rarely in cytoplasm
* Epidemiology
	* Percutaneous route was major route but now not so 
	* Now nonpercutaneous or covert percutaneous route occurs 
		* Oral is viable but inefficient
		* Intimate sexual contact
		* Perinatal transmission
	* HBsAg identified in ***every body fluids*** and ***semen and saliva are very infectious*** 
	* Perinatal transmission
		* Third trimester or early postpartum
		* In active hepatitis mothers 
		* Most at time of delivery
		* ***Not related to breast feeding*** 
		* More with HbeAg and high replication

		* 3 deltoid IM injections 0,1,6 months 
		* Pregnancy not a contraindication
		* Vaccine detail study from Harrison
	* Postexposure prophylaxis
		* Unvaccinated exposure
		* Combination of HBIG and hepB vaccine
		* Perinatal transmission to HBsAg mothers - ***0.5mL HBIG stat followed by 3 dose regimen started within 12 hour's*** 
		* Percutaneous or transmucosal single IM dose of HBIG 0.06ml/kg followed by complete course within a week 
		* In ***pregnant women with high titres (2x10^5) add nucleoside analogues*** in 3rd trimester
		* Sexual contact single HBIG 0.06ml/kg within 14 days followed by complete course
		* If both vaccine and HBIG to be given, can be given together but at different sites 
		* Anti-hbsag levels to be tested post course in adults but not in children

	- Spider angiomas rarely but disappear in convalescence
	- Posticteric phase 2-12 weeks (prolonged in B and C )
	- HDV may occur with acute or chronic HBV
		- Duration depends on duration of HBV infection
		- When acute HDV and HBV occur, indistinguishable from HBV alone (***coinfection***)
		- If chronic HBV, supports indefinite HDV replication (***Superinfection*** resembling acute exacerbation)
	- In chronic HBV
		- Acute events may occur 
		- HbeAg to anti-hbe seroconversion
		- Spontaneous reactivation
		- Reactivation in therapeutically immunosuppressed patients with chronic HBV when immunosuppression withdrawan 
		- Due to emergence of precore mutant in chronic HBV exacerbation may occur


## labs

- ALP normal or slightly elevated
- Fall in albumin uncommon
- Enzyme level does not correlate to level of liver cell damage 
- Usually 400-4000 and resolved with recovery phase 
- Jaundice when bilirubin >2.5 and typically bilirubin is 5-20 
- Bilirubin may rise even with falling transaminases and usually equally in conjugated and unconjugated
- If >20 persisting late into course suggests severe disease but maybe due to superimposed hemolysis in (not associated with.poor prognosis then)
	- G6PD deficiency
	- Hemolytic Anemia
	- Sickle cell Anemia
- Transient neutropenia and lymphopenia followed by relative lymphocytosis 
- Atypical lymphos in acute phase

	- Titre has no relation to degree of liver damage
	- Inverse correlation between HBsAg titre and liver damage 
	- Liver damage related to immune status rather than HBsAg
	- If HBsAg present of unknown significance then IgM anti-Hbc for acute vs chronic
	- Anti-hbsag rare in HBsAg and acute HBV
	- Anti-hbsag maybe seen in 10-20% of chronic HBV against heterotypic subtype determinant due to stimulation of related clone of antibody making cells 
	- Anti-hbsag only marker after immunisation

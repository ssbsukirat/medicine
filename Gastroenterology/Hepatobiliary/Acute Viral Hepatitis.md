* liver predominantly but ***systemic infection***
* one of 
	* HAV 
	* ***HBV --> only DNA amongst*** 
	* HCV 
	* HBV-associated delta agent or hepatitis D virus (HDV)
	* HEV 
* HBV 
	* only DNA 
	* replicates like a ***retrovirus*** 
* spectrum 
	* asymptomatic and inapparent
	* fulminant and fatal acute infections 
	* subclinical persistent infections to 
	* rapidly progressive chronic liver disease with cirrhosis 
	* hepatocellular carcinoma
# Hepatitis A 
* nonenveloped 27-nm 
    * Quasi-enveloped particles enclosed in plasma derived membrane circulate 
* heat-, acid-, and ether- resistant, 
* single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus
* Hepatovirus genus of the ***picornavirus*** family
* Virion 
    * 4 structural VP1-4 for capsid 
    * 6 nonstructural proteins 
* Inactivation of activity by 
    * boiling for 1 min 
    * Formaldehyde and chlorine 
    * UV irradiation
* IP of 3-4 weeks
* Replication in liver only but 
    * seen in liver bile stools and blood also 
    * ***Reduced in all except liver once jaundice sets in*** (also infectivity)
    * RNA maybe detected by PCR months in low levels in stool blood liver
    * PCR levels do not correlate with infectivity
* ***Anti-hav*** can be detected during acute illness with ***elevated transaminases*** 
    * IgM initially (3 months) upto 6/12 month
    * IgG during convalescence
    * IgG once established gives lifelong immunity

# hepatitis B 
* DNA virus
* Compact structure
* Only 3200bp encode for 4 viral products
* 4 overlapping genes - S C P & X
* Hepadnavirus family

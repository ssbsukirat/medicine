# Portal Hypertension 
* elevation of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to >5 mmHg.
* Caused by a combination of two simultaneously occurring hemodynamic processes: 
	* increased intrahepatic resistance to the passage of blood flow through the liver due to cirrhosis, regenerative nodules, and microthrombi
	* Increased splanchnic blood flow secondary to vasodilation within the splanchnic vascular bed.
	* activation of neurohumoral responses and vasoconstrictive systems resulting in sodium and water retention, increased blood volume, and hyperdynamic circulatory system producing more portal hypertension
* initially compensate with HVPG 5-10mm, asymptomatic and last around 10 years 
* clinically significant portal hypertension 
	* defined as a HVPG â‰¥10 mmHg 
	* risk of decompensation with variceal bleeding, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy. 
	* median mortality is <2 years 
* ![[phtn-class.png]]
* intrahepatic causes most common (95%)
* cirrhosis most common cause 
* Coagulation disorders causing PV thrombus
	* Polycythemia Vera 
	* Essential thrombocytosis 
	* Protein C, S deficiency 
	* AT-III 
	* Factor V leiden 
## Clinical Features 
* varices with bleed 
* hypersplenism 
* ascites 
### Esophageal Varices 
* screen cirrhosis with endoscopy 
* in 1/3 patients ++ 
* 1/3 with varices have bleeding 
* Factor predicting bleeding 
	* severity of cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score);
	* the height of wedged-hepatic vein pressure >12mmhg
	* the size of the varix; 
	* the location of the varix;
	* endoscopic stigmata, 
		* red wale signs, 
		* hematocystic spots, 
		* diffuse erythema,
		* bluish color, 
		* cherry red spots
		*  white-nipple spots
	* Tense ascites 
* Diagnosis 
	* Usually by 
		* thrombocytopenia 
		* enlarged spleen 
		* ascites 
		* encephalopathy 
		* varices +/- bleeding (endoscopy )
	* CT/MRI 
		* nodular liver and in finding changes of portal hypertension with intraabdominal collateral circulation.
* Treatment 
	* PRIMARY prophylaxis and prevent rebleeding 
	* Primary prophylaxis 
		* routine endoscopy 
			* at diagnosis 
			* every 2 years in active disease 
			* every 3 years in inactivated 
			* at time of hepatic decompensation 
		* if bleeding risk identified , either (both equally effective )
			* Non-selective Beta blocker (NSSB)
				* goal HR 55-60/min 
				* SBP >90mmhg
			* Band ligation
		* if primary prophylaxis initiated, no need of endoscopy surveillance 
	* Manage acute bleed 
		* fluid + RBC 
		* transfuse when <7g/dL with goal 7-9g/dL 
		* Dont correct PT with FFPs unless coagulopathy + (bleeding at other sites)
		* Vasoconstrictive agent (somatostatin or ocreotide)
			* for initial bleeding control 
			* reduce transfusion need 
			* reduces mortality 
		* Prophylactic antibiotic (ceftriaxone) prior to endoscopy 
		* Balloon tamponade ( Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube )
		* ugi

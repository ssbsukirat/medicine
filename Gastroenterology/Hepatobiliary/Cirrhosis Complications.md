# Portal Hypertension 
* elevation of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to >5 mmHg.
* Caused by a combination of two simultaneously occurring hemodynamic processes: 
	* increased intrahepatic resistance to the passage of blood flow through the liver due to cirrhosis, regenerative nodules, and microthrombi
	* Increased splanchnic blood flow secondary to vasodilation within the splanchnic vascular bed.
	* activation of neurohumoral responses and vasoconstrictive systems resulting in sodium and water retention, increased blood volume, and hyperdynamic circulatory system producing more portal hypertension
* initially compensate with HVPG 5-10mm, asymptomatic and last around 10 years 
* clinically significant portal hypertension 
	* defined as a HVPG ≥10 mmHg 
	* risk of decompensation with variceal bleeding, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy. 
	* median mortality is <2 years 
* ![[phtn-class.png]]
* intrahepatic causes most common (95%)
* cirrhosis most common cause 
* Coagulation disorders causing PV thrombus
	* Polycythemia Vera 
	* Essential thrombocytosis 
	* Protein C, S deficiency 
	* AT-III 
	* Factor V leiden 
## Clinical Features 
* varices with bleed 
* hypersplenism 
* ascites 
### Esophageal Varices 
* screen cirrhosis with endoscopy 
* in 1/3 patients ++ 
* 1/3 with varices have bleeding 
* Factor predicting bleeding 
	* severity of cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score);
	* the height of wedged-hepatic vein pressure >12mmhg
	* the size of the varix; 
	* the location of the varix;
	* endoscopic stigmata, 
		* red wale signs, 
		* hematocystic spots, 
		* diffuse erythema,
		* bluish color, 
		* cherry red spots
		*  white-nipple spots
	* Tense ascites 
* Diagnosis 
	* Usually by 
		* thrombocytopenia 
		* enlarged spleen 
		* ascites 
		* encephalopathy 
		* varices +/- bleeding (endoscopy )
	* CT/MRI 
		* nodular liver and in finding changes of portal hypertension with intraabdominal collateral circulation.
* Treatment 
	* PRIMARY prophylaxis and prevent rebleeding 
	* Primary prophylaxis 
		* routine endoscopy 
			* at diagnosis 
			* every 2 years in active disease 
			* every 3 years in inactivated 
			* at time of hepatic decompensation 
		* if bleeding risk identified , either (both equally effective )
			* Non-selective Beta blocker (NSSB)
				* goal HR 55-60/min 
				* SBP >90mmhg
			* Band ligation
		* if primary prophylaxis initiated, no need of endoscopy surveillance 
	* Manage acute bleed 
		* fluid + RBC 
		* transfuse when <7g/dL with goal 7-9g/dL 
		* Dont correct PT with FFPs unless coagulopathy + (bleeding at other sites)
		* Vasoconstrictive agent (somatostatin or ocreotide)
			* for initial bleeding control 
			* reduce transfusion need 
			* reduces mortality 
		* Prophylactic antibiotic (ceftriaxone) prior to endoscopy 
		* Balloon tamponade ( Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube )
		* UGI endoscopy is 1st line treatment 
			* EVL ligation 
			* if unsuccessful (extending to stomach ) consider TIPS 
		* TIPS 
			* portocaval shunt 
			* percutaneous approach
			* expandable metal stent,
			* advanced under angiographic guidance to the hepatic veins
			* encephalopathy in 20% 
			* maybe used as bridge to transplant 
			* monitor with doppler USG for stenosis 
		* repeated variceal band ligation until varices are obliterated in combination with NSBB
		* recurrent rebleeding 
			* TIPS should be performed for long-term prevention of bleeding.

### Portal hypertensive gastropathy
* cause both acute clinical GI bleeding and chronic bleeding resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.
* associated with all causes of portal hypertension
* diagnosed by characteristic endoscopy findings showing a snake skin–like mosaic pattern of gastric mucosa often with central red or brown spots. 
* bleeding, treatment is with NSBB and iron repletion. 
* Refractory bleeding may respond to TIPS.
## Splenomegaly and hypersplenism 
* common 
* often 1st indication of PHTN 
* splenomegaly + thrombocytopenia +/- leukopenia 
* Left sided or LUQ pain 
* splenomegaly no specific treatment 
## Ascites 
* accumulation of fluid within the peri- toneal cavity.
* PHTN is most common cause 
* Pathogenesis 
	* ![[ascites-patho.png]]
	* Increased intrahepatic resistance
	* vasodilation of splanchnic arterial systems causing increased portal venous inflow 
		* Nitric oxide 
		* activates RAAS and hyperaldosteronism due to arterial underfilling
		* hypoalbuminemia 
	* Hyperaldosteronism 
		* Na retention 
		* fluid accumulation 
		* peripheral edema and ascites 
* Clinical feature 
	* increased abdominal girth with peripheral edema 
	* insidious 
	* 1-2L before noticed 
	* if large may cause respiratory distress 
	* Hepatic hydrothorax 
	* malnourished with muscle wasting and fatigue 
* Diagnosis 
	* physical + imaging 
	* flank full 
	* fluid thrill / wave 
	* Shifting dullness 
		* taking patients from a supine position to lying on either their left or right side and noting the movement of the dullness to percussion
	* CT or USG may show subtle amounts 
	* Hepatic hydrothorax 
		* more common on right 
		* implies rent in diaphragm 
		* free flow of ascitic fluid to thorax 
	* Diagnostic tap at 1st presentation 
		* Total protein 
		* albumin 
		* TLC/DLC 
		* amylase 
		* cytology 
	* SAAG 
		* serum ascites-to-albumin gradient (SAAG), 
		* calculated by subtracting the fluid albumin level from the serum albumin level
		* if >1.1 --> PHTN 
			* if protein >2.5 -->cardiac 
		* <1.1 
			* infections
			* malignancy 
	* if fluid protein <2.5g --> high risk of SBP 
* Treatment 
	* Small amount by dietary sodium restrictions alone 
	    * 2g sodium a day around 3/4 teaspoon salt 
	    * Sodium education pamphlet
	    * Avoid canned or processed food 
	* Moderate by diuretic
	    * Spironolactone 100mg/day single dose
	    * Add furosemide 40mg/day if peripheral edema present
	    * Diuretic failure suggests non-compliance with low sodium diet 
	    * If no effect despite compliance, spironolactone max 400mg/day and furosemide 160mg/day 
	* Refractory ascites
	    * If despite full dose diuretic and low sodium diet
	    * Alternative like large volume paracentesis
	        * If >5L add 8g/L albumin to avoid circulatory dysfunction
	    * TIPS
	        * Does not improve survival
	        * Increase encephalopathy
	* <2 year survival after onset

## Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis
* Spontaneous infection of ascitic fluid without intrabdominal source 
* Bacterial translocation is primary pathogenesis
    * Intestinal flora go to mesenteric lymph node
    * Bacteremia 
    * Abdominal seeding
* Bacteria 
    * E coli and gut bacteria common
    * Gram positive like streptococcus viridans 
    * Staphylococcus aureus
    * Enterococcus
* If >2 bacteria isolated, consider ***secondary bacterial peritonitis*** from viscus perforation
* If fluid ANC >250/uL then confirmed
* Send cultures in blood culture bottle
* Clinical
    * Fever 
    * Altered mental status 
    * Elevated WBCs 
    * Abdominal pain or discomfort
    * AKI
* Peritoneal taps recommended
* Add 3rd gen cephalosporin IV for 5 days 
* IV albumin (1.5kg/kg day 1 and 1g/kg day 3) to improve survival and reduce risk of renal failure
* Add SBP prophylaxis in variceal bleed 
* Quinolone prophylaxis if previous recovered episode of SBP
## hepatorenal syndrome
* Functional renal failure without renal pathology in advanced cirrhosis or acute liver failure

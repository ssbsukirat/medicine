* ALD is spectrum of diseases associated with ***chronic*** alcohol consumption ranging from alcohol-associated fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis to more advanced liver disease including fibrosis and cirrhosis
* Acute alcoholic hepatitis is acute-on-chronic ALD with failure and high mortality 
# Epidemiology 
* Alcohol use disorders 
	* >2 drinks per day in women 
	* >3 drinks per day in men 
* Binge drinking 
	* 4(women) or 5(men) drinks in ~2h
* 1 drink 
	* 14g ethanol 
	* 1 beer 
	* 4 oz wine 
	* 1 oz 80% spirits 
* ALD prevalence corresponding to alcohol intake 
* Liver cirrhosis is the eleventh leading cause of mortality worldwide
# Pathogenesis 
* ethanol is ***rapidly absorbed*** in the ***upper*** gastrointestinal tract 
* predominantly metabolized in the ***liver***
* reaches the liver through the ***portal*** vein 
* ethanol is ***oxidized*** via alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (***ADH1***) into ***acetaldehyde*** in hepatocytes
* Chronic consumption induces cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 (***CYP2E1***), which also converts ethanol into ***acetaldehyde***
* acetaldehyde 
	* direct toxicity 
	* ROS generation 
	* Lipid peroxidation and DNA damage 
	* oxidized to ***Acetate*** by Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenase (***ALDH***)
* Inherited deficiency of ALDH2
	* common in Asian countries
	* acetaldehyde accumulation after alcohol  
	* develop nausea and cutaneous flushing
* mechanism of hepatic steatosis 
	* acetate to acetyl-CoA leading to fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis 
	* epigenetic changes, increases the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis,
	* genes involved in fatty acid transport and oxidation are suppressed
	* ncreases the ratio of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)/oxidized NAD (NADH/NAD+) in hepatocytes,
	* reduced mitochondrial Beta-oxidation 
	* increase fatty acid mobilization in adipose tissue and the intestine, increasing hepatic accumulation of fats 
# Risk factors of progression 
* Daily alcohol consumption or heavy drinking (but only 10-20% develop)
* dose dependent risk of alcoholic cirrhosis with alcohol 
* drinking pattern 
	* binge drinking and excessive alcohol drinking outside meals 
* Obesity and other CLD (viral, hemochromatosis, NASH)
* genetic predisposition (differed for ALD and alcohol use)
	* patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3)
	* membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7)
	* transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2)

# Clinical feature 
* clinically silent often 
* symptoms on decompensation or alcoholic hepatitis 
* usually drinking heavy >5 years and atleast till 8 weeks before symptoms 
* presentation 
	* rapid onset jaundice (bil >3)
	* fever, malaise 
	* tender hepatomegaly 
	* signs of decompensation 
		* ascites 
		* bacterial infections (12-26% at admission)
		* variceal bleed 
		* encephalopathy 
	* SIRS and AKI secondary to HRS 
* ![[ALD-presentation.png]]
# Laboratory 
* simple hepatic steatosis maybe normal liver tests 
* Steatohepatitis 
	* AST ALT high 
	* AST/ALT >1
	* AST rarely >300 
	* Bil and INR usually normal 
* Cirrhosis 
	* elevated bilirubin 
	* INR raised 
	* low albumin 
	* low platelet 
* hepatitis 
	* AST and ALT but not more than 400 
	* AST/ALT >1.5 
	* bil >3 
# Diagnosis 
* AUDIT 
	* Alcohol Use Disorders Inventory Test 
* ALD requires exclusion of other causes in heavy drinkers

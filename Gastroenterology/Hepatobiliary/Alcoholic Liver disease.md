* ALD is spectrum of diseases associated with ***chronic*** alcohol consumption ranging from alcohol-associated fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis to more advanced liver disease including fibrosis and cirrhosis
* Acute alcoholic hepatitis is acute-on-chronic ALD with failure and high mortality 
# Epidemiology 
* Alcohol use disorders 
	* >2 drinks per day in women 
	* >3 drinks per day in men 
* Binge drinking 
	* 4(women) or 5(men) drinks in ~2h
* 1 drink 
	* 14g ethanol 
	* 1 beer 
	* 4 oz wine 
	* 1 oz 80% spirits 
* ALD prevalence corresponding to alcohol intake 
* Liver cirrhosis is the eleventh leading cause of mortality worldwide
# Pathogenesis 
* ethanol is ***rapidly absorbed*** in the ***upper*** gastrointestinal tract 
* predominantly metabolized in the ***liver***
* reaches the liver through the ***portal*** vein 
* ethanol is ***oxidized*** via alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (***ADH1***) into ***acetaldehyde*** in hepatocytes
* Chronic consumption induces cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 (***CYP2E1***), which also converts ethanol into ***acetaldehyde***
* acetaldehyde 
	* direct toxicity 
	* ROS generation 
	* Lipid peroxidation and DNA damage 
	* oxidized to ***Acetate*** by Acetaldehyde Dehydrogenase (***ALDH***)
* Inherited deficiency of ALDH2
	* common in Asian countries
	* acetaldehyde accumulation after alcohol  
	* develop nausea and cutaneous flushing
* mechanism of hepatic steatosis 
	* acetate to acetyl-CoA leading to fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis 
	* epigenetic changes, increases the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis,
	* genes involved in fatty acid transport and oxidation are suppressed
	* ncreases the ratio of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)/oxidized NAD (NADH/NAD+) in hepatocytes,
	* reduced mitochondrial Beta-oxidation 
	* increase fatty acid mobilization in adipose tissue and the intestine, increasing hepatic accumulation of fats 
# Risk factors of progression 
* Daily alcohol consumption or heavy drinking (but only 10-20% develop)
* dose dependent risk of alcoholic cirrhosis with alcohol 
* drinking pattern 
	* binge drinking and excessive alcohol drinking outside meals 
* Obesity and other CLD (viral, hemochromatosis, NASH)
* genetic predisposition (differed for ALD and alcohol use)
	* patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3)
	* membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7)
	* transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2)
* ![[ALDprogress-risk.png]]
# Clinical feature 
* clinically silent often 
* symptoms on decompensation or alcoholic hepatitis 
* usually drinking heavy >5 years and atleast till 8 weeks before symptoms 
* presentation 
	* rapid onset jaundice (bil >3)
	* fever, malaise 
	* tender hepatomegaly 
	* signs of decompensation 
		* ascites 
		* bacterial infections (12-26% at admission)
		* variceal bleed 
		* encephalopathy 
	* SIRS and AKI secondary to HRS 
* ![[ALD-presentation.png]]
# Laboratory 
* simple hepatic steatosis maybe normal liver tests 
* Steatohepatitis 
	* AST ALT high 
	* AST/ALT >1
	* AST rarely >300 
	* Bil and INR usually normal 
* Cirrhosis 
	* elevated bilirubin 
	* INR raised 
	* low albumin 
	* low platelet 
* hepatitis 
	* AST and ALT but not more than 400 
	* AST/ALT >1.5 
	* bil >3 
# Diagnosis 
* AUDIT 
	* Alcohol Use Disorders Inventory Test 
* ALD requires exclusion of other causes in heavy drinkers 
* steatosis 
	* USG 
	* MRI 
	* CT 
	* non-invasive hepatic fat quantification 
		* Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP)
		* magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction (MR-PDFF)
* Biopsy rarely indicated 
	* ***macrovesicular*** steatosis around ***pericentral*** veins (zone 3)
	* hepatocytes injury 
	* ballooning 
	* mallory-denk bodies 
	* necrosis 
	* lobular inflammation with mononuclear and neutrophil granulocyte 
* Progression 
	* liver stiffness measure 
		* transient elastography (FibroScan)
		* <6kPa is normal 
		* >8kPa >_ F3 advanced fibrosis 
		* >12.5 is F4 
	* Histology --> septal fibrosis 
		* initially perivenular fibrosis with subsequent extension of collagen fibers into hepatic lobules
* Cirrhosis 
	* nodularity on imaging with ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan. 
	* Radiologic signs of portal hypertension include ascites, splenomegaly, and portal- systemic collateral vessels.
* Prognosis and mortality scores 
	* child-pugh-turcotte (CTP)
	* MELD 
	* MELD-Na 
* If presentation as alcoholic hepatitis 
	* rule out biliary obstruction and HCC 
	* viral hepatitis, Wilson’s disease, and severe autoimmune liver disease ruled out
	* histology 
		* macrovesicular steatosis, 
		* hepatocyte ballooning with Mallory-Denk bodies, 
		* ***megamitochondria***, 
		* neutrophil infiltration, 
		* ***bilirubinostasis*** 
		* ***chicken wire fibrosis***
	* Biopsy indications (transjugular)
		* potential confounding factors, 
			* possible ischemic hepatitis (in the setting of, e.g., hypotension, massive gastrointestinal bleeding, recent cocaine use, septic shock)
			* drug-induced liver injury (DILI) 
			* autoimmune liver disease, 
		* uncertain alcohol use assess- ment,
		* atypical laboratory tests (AST <50 IU/L or >400 IU/L, AST/ALT ratio <1.5)

# Treatment 
* most effective is prolonged alcohol abstinence 
* alcohol- associated hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are reversible
* no approved drugs 
* risk of decompensation ++ 
* if cirrhosis 
	* Upper GI endoscopy for ***Varices*** 
	* HCC screen every 6 months by USG 
* manage decompensation 
* liver transplant in decompensation 
* short-term mortality calculation
	* ***Maddrey discriminant Function***
		* 4.6 × (the prolongation of the prothrombin time above control {seconds) + serum bilirubin (mg/dL)
	* MELD 
	* ABIC 
		* age-bilirubin-INR-Creatinine score 
	* MDF <32 or MELD ≤20 are defined as having moderate alcoholic hepatitis

* ALD is spectrum of diseases associated with ***chronic*** alcohol consumption ranging from alcohol-associated fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis to more advanced liver disease including fibrosis and cirrhosis
* Acute alcoholic hepatitis is acute-on-chronic ALD with failure and high mortality 
# Epidemiology 
* Alcohol use disorders 
	* >2 drinks per day in women 
	* >3 drinks per day in men 
* Binge drinking 
	* 4(women) or 5(men) drinks in ~2h
* 1 drink 
	* 14g ethanol 
	* 1 beer 
	* 4 oz wine 
	* 1 oz 80% spirits 
* ALD prevalence corresponding to alcohol intake 
* Liver cirrhosis is the eleventh leading cause of mortality worldwide
# Pathogenesis 
* ethanol is ***rapidly absorbed*** in the ***upper*** gastrointestinal tract 
* predominantly metabolized in the ***liver***
* reaches the liver through the ***portal*** vein 
* ethanol is ***oxidized*** via alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (***ADH1***) into ***acetaldehyde*** in hepatocytes

# Bilirubin Metabolism 
* End products of heme degradation 
* peripheral production tranported to liver via plasma (water insoluble so albumin bound)
* bilirubin from blood to bile 
	* ***Hepatocellular uptake***: Uptake of bilirubin by the hepatocyte has carrier-mediated kinetics (carrier unknown)
	* ***Intracellular Binding***: bilirubin is kept in solution by binding as a nonsubstrate ligand to several of the ***glutathione-S-transferases***, formerly called ***ligandins***
	* ***Conjugation***
		* with one or two glucuronic acid moieties by a specific ***UDP-glucuronosyltransferase***
		* form ***bilirubin mono- and diglucuronide***, respectively. 
		* disrupts the internal hydrogen bonding (responsible for insoluble ) , and glucuronide conjugates are highly soluble in water. 
		* obligatory for excretion of bilirubin across the bile canalicular membrane into bile 
		* UGT1 family responsible 
		* UGT1A1 gene encodes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
	* ***Biliary excretion***

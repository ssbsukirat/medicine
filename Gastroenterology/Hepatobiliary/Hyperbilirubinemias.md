# Bilirubin Metabolism 
* End products of heme degradation 
* peripheral production tranported to liver via plasma (water insoluble so albumin bound)
* bilirubin from blood to bile 
	* ***Hepatocellular uptake***: Uptake of bilirubin by the hepatocyte has carrier-mediated kinetics (carrier unknown)
	* ***Intracellular Binding***: bilirubin is kept in solution by binding as a nonsubstrate ligand to several of the ***glutathione-S-transferases***, formerly called ***ligandins***
	* ***Conjugation***
		* with one or two glucuronic acid moieties by a specific ***UDP-glucuronosyltransferase***
		* form ***bilirubin mono- and diglucuronide***, respectively. 
		* disrupts the internal hydrogen bonding (responsible for insoluble ) , and glucuronide conjugates are highly soluble in water. 
		* obligatory for excretion of bilirubin across the bile canalicular membrane into bile 
		* UGT1 family responsible 
		* UGT1A1 gene encodes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
	* ***Biliary excretion*** 
		* recently thought bilirubin mono- and diglucuronides are excreted directly across the canalicular plasma membrane into the bile canaliculus
		* by an ***ATP-dependent*** process mediated by a canalicular membrane protein called multidrug resistance–associated protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2).
		* ***MRP2*** mutation causes ***Dubin-Johnson syndrome***
		* Rotor syndrome study suggests 
			* portion of the glucuronides is transported into the portal circulation by a sinusoidal membrane protein called multidrug resistance–associated protein 3 (MRP3, ABCC3)
			* subjected to reuptake into the hepatocyte by the sinusoidal membrane uptake transporters organic anion transport protein 1B1 (OATP1B1, SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3).

# Extrahepatic aspects of bilirubin depositsion 
## Gut 
* reaches the duodenum and passes down the gastrointestinal tract ***without reabsorption*** by the intestinal mucosa.
* fraction is converted by bacterial metabolism in the gut to the water-soluble ***colorless compound urobilinogen***. 
* Urobilinogen undergoes ***enterohepatic cycling***. 
* Urobilinogen not taken up by the liver reaches the systemic circulation, from which some is cleared by the kidneys.
* Unconjugated bilirubin usually does not reach gut except 
	* neonates
	* alternate pathways in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
## Renal excretion of conjugates 
* Unconjugated bilirubin is not excreted in urine,
	* tightly bound to albumin for effective glomerular filtration
	* no tubular mechanism for its renal secretion.
* bilirubin conjugates are readily filtered at the glomerulus 
	* appear in urine in disorders characterized by ***increased bilirubin conjugates*** in the circulation. 
* kidney can serve as an “overflow valve” for conjugated bilirubin. 
	* level of jaundice in individuals with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be ***amplified in the presence of renal failure***.

# Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemias 
## Increased Bilirubin Production 
### Hemolysis 
* Increased destruction leads to more bilirubin turnover 
* ***modest*** unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia if Normal liver function 
* Bone marrow can make 8x increased production --> hemolysis causes max bilirubin of 4mg/dL 
* if >4mg/dL implies hepatic dysfunction 
* direct <15% 
* if systemic disease or hepatic dysfunction both conjugated and unconjugated maybe raised 
* ***Prolonged*** hemolysis may precipitate bilirubin salts within the gallbladder or biliary tree, 
	* formation of ***bilirubin gallstones***
		* acute or chronic cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, or any other biliary tract consequence of calculous disease
### ineffective erythropoiesis

# Bilirubin Metabolism 
* End products of heme degradation 
* peripheral production tranported to liver via plasma (water insoluble so albumin bound)
* bilirubin from blood to bile 
	* ***Hepatocellular uptake***: Uptake of bilirubin by the hepatocyte has carrier-mediated kinetics (carrier unknown)
	* ***Intracellular Binding***: bilirubin is kept in solution by binding as a nonsubstrate ligand to several of the ***glutathione-S-transferases***, formerly called ***ligandins***
	* ***Conjugation***
		* with one or two glucuronic acid moieties by a specific ***UDP-glucuronosyltransferase***
		* form ***bilirubin mono- and diglucuronide***, respectively. 
		* disrupts the internal hydrogen bonding (responsible for insoluble ) , and glucuronide conjugates are highly soluble in water. 
		* obligatory for excretion of bilirubin across the bile canalicular membrane into bile 
		* UGT1 family responsible 
		* UGT1A1 gene encodes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
	* ***Biliary excretion*** 
		* recently thought bilirubin mono- and diglucuronides are excreted directly across the canalicular plasma membrane into the bile canaliculus
		* by an ***ATP-dependent*** process mediated by a canalicular membrane protein called multidrug resistance–associated protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2).
		* ***MRP2*** mutation causes ***Dubin-Johnson syndrome***
		* Rotor syndrome study suggests 
			* portion of the glucuronides is transported into the portal circulation by a sinusoidal membrane protein called multidrug resistance–associated protein 3 (MRP3, ABCC3)
			* subjected to reuptake into the hepatocyte by the sinusoidal membrane uptake transporters organic anion transport protein 1B1 (OATP1B1, SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3).

# Extrahepatic aspects of bilirubin depositsion 
## Gut 
* reaches the duodenum and passes down the gastrointestinal tract ***without reabsorption*** by the intestinal mucosa.
* fraction is converted by bacterial metabolism in the gut to the water-soluble ***colorless compound urobilinogen***. 
* Urobilinogen undergoes ***enterohepatic cycling***. 
* Urobilinogen not taken up by the liver reaches the systemic circulation, from which some is cleared by the kidneys.
* Unconjugated bilirubin usually does not reach gut except 
	* neonates
	* alternate pathways in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
## Renal excretion of conjugates 
* Unconjugated bilirubin is not excreted in urine,
	* tightly bound to albumin for effective glomerular filtration
	* no tubular mechanism for its renal secretion.
* bilirubin conjugates are readily filtered at the glomerulus 
	* appear in urine in disorders characterized by ***increased bilirubin conjugates*** in the circulation. 
* kidney can serve as an “overflow valve” for conjugated bilirubin. 
	* level of jaundice in individuals with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be ***amplified in the presence of renal failure***.

# Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemias 
## Increased Bilirubin Production 
### Hemolysis 
* Increased destruction leads to more bilirubin turnover 
* ***modest*** unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia if Normal liver function 
* Bone marrow can make 8x increased production --> hemolysis causes max bilirubin of 4mg/dL 
* if >4mg/dL implies hepatic dysfunction 
* direct <15% 
* if systemic disease or hepatic dysfunction both conjugated and unconjugated maybe raised 
* ***Prolonged*** hemolysis may precipitate bilirubin salts within the gallbladder or biliary tree, 
	* formation of ***bilirubin gallstones***
		* acute or chronic cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, or any other biliary tract consequence of calculous disease
### ineffective erythropoiesis 
* Destruction of developing erythroid cells and small amount of HB extruded during nuclear maturation account for bilirubin production
* Fraction of bilirubin from ineffective erythropoiesis increased in
    * Thalassemia
    * Megaloblastic Anemia (b12 folate)
    * Congenital erythropoitic porphyria
    * Lead poisoning
    * Dyserythropoetic anemias
* May account for 70% of total bilirubin
* Usually modest unconjugated bilirubin
### others
* Degradation of HB in extravascular blood pooling like in infarction or hematomas
## decreased hepatic bilirubin clearance
### decreased hepatic uptake 
 * In Gilbert's syndrome
 * Drugs (resolves with stopping of drug)
     * Flavaspidic acid 
     * Novobiocin
     * Rifampin 
     * Contrast agents 
### impaired conjugation
- physiological neonatal jaundice
    - in fetus bilirubin cleared by placenta and maternal liver 
    - At birth, neonatal liver must take over but physiological processes underdeveloped
    - Ugt1a1 levels low and alternate excretory pathways pass unconjugated bilirubin in gut 
    - Intestinal flora underdeveloped so urobilinogen conversion low , enterohepatic bilirubin circulation develops 
    - 2-5 days after birth most develop unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
    - <5-10 usually (higher in premature)
    - Corrects in 2 weeks 
    - if rapidly rising or >20 may cause kernicterus
    - In kernicterus, bilirubin may cross blood brain barrier and precipitate in basal ganglia and other areas 
    - Phototherapy converts bilirubin into water soluble photoisomers excreted into bioe
    - Canalicular mechanism responsible for excretion also immature so may cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- Acquired conjugation defects 
    - modest reduction in advanced hepatitis or cirrhosis
    - Conjugation better preserved than canalicular mechanism
    - Drugs inhibiting ugt1a1
        - pregnanediol 
        - Novobiocin
        - Chloramphenicol
        - Gentamicin
        - Atazanavir 
    - Fatty acids in breast milk may inhibit conjugation causing breast milk jaundice
    - Increased enterohepatic circulation in infants 
    - Lucey-driscoll syndrome
        - transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
        - Ugt1a1 inhibitors in maternal serum 
## hereditary conjugation defects 
* ![[Unconjugatedsyndromes.png]]
### crigler Najjar type 1 
- striking unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- 20-45 mg/dL 
- Starts at neonate
- Persists for life
- Other LFTs normal with no evidence of hemolysis
- Hepatic histology
    - usual normal 
    - Occasional bile plugs in canaliculi 
- Absent bilirubin glucuronide and no detectable ugt1a1 activity 
- No response to phenobarbital or enzyme inducers
- Unconjugated bilirubin with very slow clearance by alternative mechanism (direct passage in bile or gut by photoisomers)
- Trace urobilinogen in feces, no bilirubin in urine
- ***Estrogen*** glucuronidation (mediated by UGT1A1) ***defective***
- isolated hepatocyte transplantation used in a small number of cases
- early liver transplantation best hope to prevent brain injury and death at present
- phototherapy prolongs lifespan without NeurologicaL damage 
### Crigler-Najjar type 2
* marked unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of abnormalities of 
	* other conventional hepatic biochemical tests,
	* hepatic histology 
	* hemolysis
* Difference vs type 1
	* lower bilirubin 
	* rare kernicterus 
	* deep coloured bile, glucuronide + with increased monoglucoronide 
	* UGT1A1 <10% normal but present 
	* may not be recognised till later (max till now 34)
	* Reduction of bilirubin >25% in response to enzyme inducers such as phenobarbital
* phenobarbital therapy recommended, a single bedtime dose often sufficing
* missense mutations are more common in CN-II 
### GIlbert Syndrome 
* mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
* normal biochemical LFTs
* normal histology (mildly increased lipofuscin in some)
* 5-8 bilirubin usually but raised in 
	* stress 
	* fatigue 
	* alcohol 
	* reduced calories 
	* intercurrent illness 
* bilirubin clearance is reduced to an average of one-third of normal 
* Irinotecan goes through same pathway so increased toxicity like diarrhea and myelosuppression 
* Indinavir and atazanavir may cause hyperbilirubinemia in GIlbert due to UGT1A1 inhibition 
* earlier thought to be AD 
# Mixed or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
* not possible to differentiate intrahepatic from extrahepatic causes of jaundice based on the serum levels or relative proportions of unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin 
## Familial 
### Dubin-Johnson 
* benign rare 
* low grade primarily conjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
* defective expression of ***MRP2 (ABCC2)***, an ATP-dependent canalicular membrane transporter
* AR inheritance 
* 2-5 bilirubin or normal or 20-25
* increase by 
	* illness 
	* OCPs 
	* pregnancy 
* bilirubinuria ++ 
* asymptomatic with vague constitutional symptoms 
	* unexplained jaundice with anxiety 
* other LFTs normal 
* Histology 
	* accumulation of dark, coarsely granular pigment in the lysosomes of centrilobular hepatocytes.
	* liver may be grossly black in appearance.
	* pigment is thought to be derived from epinephrine metabolites that are not excreted normally. 
	* pigment may disappear during bouts of viral hepatitis, only to reaccumulate slowly after recovery.
* BSP test 
	* Bromsulphalein a synthetic dye formerly used in a test of liver function. 
	* In this test, the rate of disappearance of BSP from plasma was determined following bolus IV administration. 
	* BSP is conjugated with glutathione in the hepatocyte; the resulting conjugate is normally excreted rapidly into the bile canaliculus.
	* Patients with DJS exhibit characteristic rises in plasma concentrations at 90 min after injection, due to ***reflux of conjugated BSP*** into the circulation from the hepatocyte.
	* IGC which is taken up but not metabolised dont show reflux 
	* reduction in the time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) for biliary excretion.
	* Bile acid disposition, including hepatocellular uptake and biliary excretion, is normal
### Rotors
* benign 
* AR 
* simultaneous deficiency of the hepatocyte plasma membrane transporters OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3)
* similar to Dubin-Johnson 
* rarer 
* no pigment in liver so normal appearance 
* gallbladder visualised on oral cholecystography (non-visualisation in Dubin-Johnson )
* clearance of BSP from plasma is delayed in RS, there is no reflux of conjugated BSP back into the circulation as seen in DJS.
### Benign Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholestasis (BRIC)
* rare 
* recurrent attacks of pruritis and jaundice

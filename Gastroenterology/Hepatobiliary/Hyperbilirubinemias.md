# Bilirubin Metabolism 
* End products of heme degradation 
* peripheral production tranported to liver via plasma (water insoluble so albumin bound)
* bilirubin from blood to bile 
	* ***Hepatocellular uptake***: Uptake of bilirubin by the hepatocyte has carrier-mediated kinetics (carrier unknown)
	* ***Intracellular Binding***: bilirubin is kept in solution by binding as a nonsubstrate ligand to several of the ***glutathione-S-transferases***, formerly called ***ligandins***
	* ***Conjugation***
		* with one or two glucuronic acid moieties by a specific ***UDP-glucuronosyltransferase***
		* form ***bilirubin mono- and diglucuronide***, respectively. 
		* disrupts the internal hydrogen bonding (responsible for insoluble ) , and glucuronide conjugates are highly soluble in water. 
		* obligatory for excretion of bilirubin across the bile canalicular membrane into bile 
		* UGT1 family responsible 
		* UGT1A1 gene encodes UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
	* ***Biliary excretion*** 
		* recently thought bilirubin mono- and diglucuronides are excreted directly across the canalicular plasma membrane into the bile canaliculus
		* by an ***ATP-dependent*** process mediated by a canalicular membrane protein called multidrug resistance–associated protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2).
		* ***MRP2*** mutation causes ***Dubin-Johnson syndrome***
		* Rotor syndrome study suggests 
			* portion of the glucuronides is transported into the portal circulation by a sinusoidal membrane protein called multidrug resistance–associated protein 3 (MRP3, ABCC3)
			* subjected to reuptake into the hepatocyte by the sinusoidal membrane uptake transporters organic anion transport protein 1B1 (OATP1B1, SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3).
# Extrahepatic aspects of bilirubin depositsion 
## Gut 
* reaches the duodenum and passes down the gastrointestinal tract ***without reabsorption*** by the intestinal mucosa.
* fraction is converted by bacterial metabolism in the gut to the water-soluble ***colorless compound urobilinogen***. 
* Urobilinogen undergoes ***enterohepatic cycling***. 
* Urobilinogen not taken up by the liver reaches the systemic circulation, from which some is cleared by the kidneys.
* Unconjugated bilirubin usually does not reach gut except 
	* neonates
	* alternate pathways in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia 
## Renal excretion of conjugates 
* Unconjugated bilirubin is not excreted in urine, as it is too tightly bound to albumin for effective glomerular filtration and there is no tubular mechanism for its renal secretion. In contrast, the bilirubin conjugates are readily filtered at the glomerulus and can appear in urine in disorders characterized by increased bilirubin conjugates in the circulation. It should be kept in mind that the kidney can serve as an “overflow valve” for conjugated bilirubin. Consequently, the level of jaundice in individuals with con- jugated hyperbilirubinemia can be amplified in the presence of renal failure.

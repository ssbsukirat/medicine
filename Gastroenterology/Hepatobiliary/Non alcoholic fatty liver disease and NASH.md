# Incidence prevalence and natural history 
* most common cause of CLD 
* associated with
	* insulin resistance, 
	* overweight/obesity, 
	* metabolic syndrome. 
	* can also occur in lean individuals and is particularly common in those with a ***paucity of adipose depots (i.e., lipodystrophy).***
* NAFLD is a spectrum 
	* accumulation of triglyceride in hepatocytes (steatosis) is most benign 
	* Cirrhosis and cancer most extreme 
* risk of developing cirrhosis is extremely low  with isolated steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver NAFL)
	* increases as steatosis complicated by liver-cell injury and death and the accumulation of inflammatory cells (i.e., nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH).
* 1/4 with NAFLD have NASH 
* NASH 
	* heterogeneous 
	* improves to steatosis or normal in some 
	* may remain stable for years 
	* may cause progressive fibrous scar leading to cirrhosis 
* Liver related mortality and morbidity in NAFLD
	* predicted by advanced hepatic fibrosis (higher in )
		* age >45-50
		* overweight or obese 
		* T2-DM 
	* in cirrhosis primary liver cancer risk is 1-2% per year 
* Imaging cannot differentiate NAFLD vs NASH (cell death and inflammation )
	* no specific blood test available 
	* "cryptogenic" ALT elevations maybe predictive 
		* serum ALT elevations that cannot be explained by excessive alcohol consumption, other known causes of fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, or drug-induced or congenital liver diseases

* ![[NAFLD-drugscausing.png]]
* heritable factors 
	* TM6SF2 or MBOAT7 (involved in lipid homeostasis)
	* palatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3)
		* encodes an enzyme involved in intracellular trafficking of lipids
		* severity of NASH and liver fibrosis 
	* heritance accounts for 50% risk of cirrhosis 
	* Epigenetics also affects 
		* intrauterine exposures influence susceptibility to obesity and the metabolic syndrome in adolescence
* increases risk of both ***HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma***
# Pathogenesis 
* steatosis 
	* when triglyceride ***synthesis***(lipid uptake + denovo synthesis ) >> triglyceride ***disposal*** (degradative metabolism + lipoprotein export)
	* Obesity stimulates triglyceride accumulation by altering the intestinal microbiota to enhance both energy harvest and intestinal permeability.
	* Reduced barrier function increases hepatic exposure to gut-derived products, which stimulate liver cells to generate inflammatory mediators ***that inhibit insulin actions.***
	* ***adipokines*** in obesity that reduce insulin sensitivity causing hyperinsulinemia 
	* hyperinsulinemia promote lipid uptake, fat synthesis and fat storage

# Incidence prevalence and natural history 
* most common cause of CLD 
* associated with
	* insulin resistance, 
	* overweight/obesity, 
	* metabolic syndrome. 
	* can also occur in lean individuals and is particularly common in those with a ***paucity of adipose depots (i.e., lipodystrophy).***
* NAFLD is a spectrum 
	* accumulation of triglyceride in hepatocytes (steatosis) is most benign 
	* Cirrhosis and cancer most extreme 
* risk of developing cirrhosis is extremely low  with isolated steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver NAFL)
	* increases as steatosis complicated by liver-cell injury and death and the accumulation of inflammatory cells (i.e., nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH).
* 1/4 with NAFLD have NASH 
* NASH 
	* heterogeneous 
	* improves to steatosis or normal in some 
	* may remain stable for years 
	* may cause progressive fibrous scar leading to cirrhosis 
* Liver related mortality and morbidity in NAFLD
	* predicted by advanced hepatic fibrosis (higher in )
		* age >45-50
		* overweight or obese 
		* T2-DM 
	* in cirrhosis primary liver cancer risk is 1-2% per year 
* Imaging cannot differentiate NAFLD vs NASH (cell death and inflammation )
	* no specific blood test available 
	* "cryptogenic" ALT elevations maybe predictive 
		* serum ALT elevations that cannot be explained by excessive alcohol consumption, other known causes of fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, or drug-induced or congenital liver diseases
* ![[NAFLD-spectrum.png]]
* heritable factors 
	* TM6SF2 or MBOAT7 (involved in lipid homeostasis)
	* palatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3)
		* encodes an enzyme involved in intracellular trafficking of lipids
		* severity of NASH and liver fibrosis 
	* heritance accounts for 50% risk of cirrhosis 
	* Epigenetics also affects 
		* intrauterine exposures influence susceptibility to obesity and the metabolic syndrome in adolescence
* increases risk of both ***HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma***
# Pathogenesis 
* steatosis 
	* when triglyceride ***synthesis***(lipid uptake + denovo synthesis ) >> triglyceride ***disposal*** (degradative metabolism + lipoprotein export)
	* Obesity stimulates triglyceride accumulation by altering the intestinal microbiota to enhance both energy harvest and intestinal permeability.
	* Reduced barrier function increases hepatic exposure to gut-derived products, which stimulate liver cells to generate inflammatory mediators ***that inhibit insulin actions.***
	* ***adipokines*** in obesity that reduce insulin sensitivity causing hyperinsulinemia 
	* hyperinsulinemia promote lipid uptake, fat synthesis and fat storage 
	* triglyceride on its own not cytotoxic 
		* precursors (e.g., fatty acids and diacylglycerols) 
		* metabolic by-products (e.g., reactive oxygen species)
	* lipotoxicity causes cell death and compensatory cell repair 
		* transient expansion of myofibroblasts and progenitor cells, that make and degrade matrix, remodel the vasculature, and generate replacement hepatocytes, as well as the recruitment of immune cells
* Cirrhosis results from futile repair, i.e., progressive accumulation of wound healing cells, fibrous matrix, and abnormal vasculature (scarring), rather than efficient reconstruction/regeneration of healthy hepatic parenchyma
* cancers develop when malignantly transformed liver cells escape mechanisms that normally control regenerative growth.
# Diagnosis 
* demonstration of increased liver fat in the absence of hazardous levels of alcohol consumption 
	* >1(women ) >2(men) drinks per day 
* exclude other causes like drugs and causes of liver injury 
* ![[NAFLD-alternatecauses.png]]
* ![[NAFLD-drugscausing.png]]
* can be done by history , physical , imaging ( USG, CT, MRI), blood test 
	* invasive testing not needed 
* liver may not be enlarged and LFTs maybe normal 
* diagnosis confidence increased by risk factors presence 
	* increased body mass index 
	* insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus,
	* metabolic syndrome (e.g., systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia/gout, cardiovascular disease) in the ***patient or family*** members. 
	* pituitary or hypothalamic neoplasms 
	* women with polycystic ovary syndrome 
	* Hypothyroidism and obstructive sleep apnea
* Staging NAFLD more difficult than diagnosis 
* staging defines prognosis 
	* steatosis vs NASH vs advanced fibrosis 
* staging by 
	* non-invasive (blood, physical, imaging )
	* invasive (biopsy )
* advanced NAFLD 
	* Blood tests 
		* hepatic dysfunction 
			* hyperbilirubinemia 
			* hypoalbuminemia 
			* PT elongation 
		* Portal hypertension (thrombocytopenia )
	* stigmata of portal hypertension 
		* spider angiomata 
		* palmar erythema 
		* splenomegaly 
		* ascites 
		* clubbing encephalopathy 
* biopsy
	* gold standard 
	* sampling error unless tissue core >2cm acquired
	* complication less 
		* significant bleeding, 
		* pain, or 
		* inadvertent puncture of other organs
* AST ALT not accurate markers 
* algorithm with multiple tests devised 
	* Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF)score, 
	* BARD score,
	* AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI)score,
	* NAFLD fibrosis score (commonly used)
	* Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score (common )
* NAFLD fibrosis score & FIB-4 
	* age,
	* body mass index,
	* glucose, 
	* platelet count,
	* albumin, 
	* AST, ALT 
* scores + non-invasive quantification of liver fat (better predictive power)
	* MRI using proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF)
	* liver stiffness, a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis 
		* magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)
		* transient elastography (FibroScan)
	* factors reducing specificity of stiffness tests 
		* obesity, 
		* nonfasting state, 
		* hepatic inflammation, 
		* iron overload
		* hepatic congestion
# Clinical manifestations 
* asymptomatic 
* diagnosis by abnormal LFTs or fatty liver on other testing 
* maybe diagnosed at vague RUQ pain, hepatomegaly , abnormal liver appearance at abdominal surgery 
* 50-90% subjects obese (+/- metabolic syndrome )
* stigmata maybe present 
* minority have complication at presentation (jaundice, portal hypertension , variceal hemorrhage )
* uncommon association 
	* chronic fatigue 
	* mood alterations 
	* OSA 
	* thyroid dysfunction 
	* PCOS 
	* chronic pain syndrome 
* 2-3x risk of developing metabolic syndrome 
* risk for endothelial dysfunction , more plaques in vessels 

# Treatment 
* 3 component 
	* specific therapy 
	* comorbidities management 
	* treating complication 
* no FDA approved therapy 
## Diet and exercise 
* lifestlye changes and dietary modifications 
* weight loss and increase insulin sensitivity 
* 3-5% weight loss improves steatosis 
* >7-10% improves steatohepatitis and fibrosis 
* dietary macro changes less important than energy intake reduction 
* Mediterranean-type diet has been reported to improve NASH and liver fibrosis independently of weight loss.
* reduce fructose and ***increase coffee***
* exercise 
	* complements dietary caloric restriction
	* improves insulin sensitivity 
	* 30 mins moderate intensity aerobic or resistance training 5x/week 
## PHARMACOLOGICAL 
* no approved drugs 
* NAFLD without NASH or fibrosis only diet and physical therapy 
* NASH or fibrosis get pharma 
* Metformin 
	* hepatic insulin sensitivity 
	* TONIC study 
	* not recommended 
* Thiazolidinediones 
	* insulin sensitivity 
	* improved histology 
	* PIVENS study 
	* may gain weight and liver fibrosis does not improves 
* liraglutide / semaglutide may be useful 
* SGLT2 inhibitors \
* antioxidants 
	* Vitamin E 
		* inexpensive
		* potent 
		* 800 IU/day 
		* improves blood, radiological , histology 
		* may increase risk of cardiovascular mortality , hemorrhage stroke, prostate cancer

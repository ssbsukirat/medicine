# Incidence prevalence and natural history 
* most common cause of CLD 
* associated with
	* insulin resistance, 
	* overweight/obesity, 
	* metabolic syndrome. 
	* can also occur in lean individuals and is particularly common in those with a ***paucity of adipose depots (i.e., lipodystrophy).***
* NAFLD is a spectrum 
	* accumulation of triglyceride in hepatocytes (steatosis) is most benign 
	* Cirrhosis and cancer most extreme 
* risk of developing cirrhosis is extremely low  with isolated steatosis (nonalcoholic fatty liver NAFL)
	* increases as steatosis complicated by liver-cell injury and death and the accumulation of inflammatory cells (i.e., nonalcoholic steatohepatitis NASH).
* 1/4 with NAFLD have NASH 
* NASH 
	* heterogeneous 
	* improves to steatosis or normal in some 
	* may remain stable for years 
	* may cause progressive fibrous scar leading to cirrhosis 
* Liver related mortality and morbidity in NAFLD
	* predicted by advanced hepatic fibrosis 
	* in cirrhosis primary liver cancer risk is 1-2% per year 
* Imaging cannot differentiate NAFLD vs NASH (cell death and inflammation )

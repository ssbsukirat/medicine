# Overview

- Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a systemic infection predominantly affecting the liver.
- Almost all cases of acute viral hepatitis are caused by one of five viral agents, including HCV.
- HCV is an RNA virus.
- Although these agents can be distinguished by their molecular and antigenic properties, all types of viral hepatitis produce clinically similar illnesses.
- HCV is one of the bloodborne types (HBV, HCV, and HDV) associated with subclinical persistent infections, rapidly progressive chronic liver disease with cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma.
- Before its identification, Hepatitis C was labeled "non-A, non-B hepatitis".

# Virology

- HCV is a linear, single-strand, positive-sense, 9600-nucleotide RNA virus.
- Its genome organization is similar to that of flaviviruses and pestiviruses.
- HCV is the only member of the genus **_Hepacivirus_ in the family _Flaviviridae_**.
- The HCV genome contains a single, large open reading frame (ORF) (gene) that codes for a virus polyprotein of ~3000 amino acids, which is cleaved after translation to yield 10 viral proteins.
- The 5′ end of the genome consists of an untranslated region (containing an internal ribosomal entry site [IRES]) adjacent to the genes for **three structural proteins: the nucleocapsid core protein (C) and two envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2).**
- The 5′ untranslated region and core gene are highly conserved among genotypes.
- The envelope proteins are coded for by the **hypervariable region**, which varies from isolate to isolate and may allow the virus to evade host immunologic containment.
- The 3′ end of the genome includes an untranslated region and contains the genes for **seven nonstructural (NS) proteins: p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B.**
- p7 is a membrane ion channel protein necessary for efficient assembly and release of HCV.
- NS2 is a cysteine protease that cleaves NS3 from NS2.
- NS3-4A is a serine protease that cleaves all downstream proteins from the polyprotein.
- Important NS proteins involved in virus replication include: NS3 helicase, NS3-4A serine protease, NS5A (multifunctional membrane-associated phosphoprotein, essential component of replication web), and NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
- HCV does not replicate via a DNA intermediate; therefore, it does not integrate into the host genome.
- HCV tends to circulate in relatively low titer (10^3−10^7 virions/mL), making visualization of the 50- to 80-nm virus particles difficult.
- The replication rate of HCV is very high (10^12 virions per day), and its half-life is 2.7 h.
- HCV entry into the hepatocyte occurs via the **non-liver-specific CD81** receptor and the **liver-specific tight junction protein claudin-1.**
- Additional host receptors for HCV entry include occludin, low-density lipoprotein receptors, glycosaminoglycans, scavenger receptor B1, and epidermal growth factor receptor, among others.
- Relying on the same assembly and secretion pathway as low-density and very-low-density lipoproteins, HCV is a lipoviroparticle and masquerades as a lipoprotein. This may limit its visibility to the adaptive immune system and explain its ability to evade immune containment and clearance.
- After viral entry and uncoating, translation is initiated by the IRES on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
- The HCV polyprotein is cleaved during and posttranslationally by host cellular proteases as well as HCV NS2-3 and NS3-4A proteases.
- Host cofactors involved in HCV replication include cyclophilin A (binds to NS5A, required for replication) and liver-specific host microRNA miR-122.

## Genotypes

- At least six distinct major genotypes (and a minor genotype 7), as well as >50 subtypes within genotypes, have been identified by nucleotide sequencing.
- Genotypes differ by ≥30% in sequence homology; subtypes differ by ~20%.
- Intragenotypic differences are referred to as quasispecies, differing by only a few percent.
- The genotypic and quasispecies diversity of HCV, resulting from its high mutation rate, interferes with effective humoral immunity.
- Neutralizing antibodies to HCV exist but tend to be short-lived; infection does not induce lasting immunity against reinfection with different or same isolates.
- Neither heterologous nor homologous immunity appears to develop commonly after acute HCV infection.
- Some genotypes are worldwide, others geographically confined.
- Differences exist among genotypes in responsiveness to antiviral therapy, but **same pathogenesis and symptoms** 
- Genotype 3 is linked to hepatic steatosis and clinical progression.
- Worldwide, genotype 1 is the most common.
- In the United States, genotype 1 accounts for 70% of infections; genotypes 2 and 3 account for the remaining 30%.
- Among African Americans in the US, the frequency of genotype 1 is even higher (~90%).
- Genotype 4 predominates in Egypt; genotype 5 is localized to South Africa, genotype 6 to Hong Kong, and genotype 7 to Central Africa.

# Pathogenesis and Immune Response

- None of the hepatitis viruses is known to be directly cytopathic to hepatocytes under ordinary circumstances.
- Clinical manifestations and outcomes are determined by the immunologic responses of the host.
- The immunopathogenesis of hepatitis C has been studied extensively.
- HCV is very efficient in evading host immune mechanisms, disrupting host immune responses at multiple levels.
- exposure --> host cells identify viral product motifs (pattern recognition receptors)-->  interferon and other cytokine elaboration, activating innate and adaptive immune responses.
- Intrahepatic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class 1–restricted cytolytic T cells directed at nucleocapsid, envelope, and nonstructural viral protein antigens have been demonstrated in chronic hepatitis C. However, these don't correlate well with liver injury or recovery.
- A consensus supports the role of virus-activated CD4+ helper T cells stimulating HCV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in the pathogenesis of liver injury.
- These T-cell responses appear **more robust** (higher number, diverse specificity, functionally effective, longer lasting) in those who recover than in those with chronic infection.
- Factors contributing to chronic infection include: 
	- a CD4+ proliferative defect leading to rapid contraction of responses, 
	- mutations in CD8+ T cell–targeted viral epitopes allowing evasion of immune clearance, and 
	- upregulation of inhibitory receptors on functionally impaired, exhausted T cells.
- HCV proteins have been shown to interfere with innate immunity by blocking type 1 interferon responses and inhibiting interferon signaling and effector molecules.
- Several HLA alleles have been linked with self-limited hepatitis C, most convincingly the CC haplotype of the IL28B gene (coding for interferon λ3).
- The IL28B association is even stronger when combined with HLA class II DQB1*03:01.
- Non-CC IL28B polymorphisms linked to failure to clear HCV are explained by a chromosome 19q13.13 frameshift variant upstream of IL28B, creating an ORF in a novel interferon gene (IFN-λ4) associated with impaired clearance.
- NK cells of the innate immune system also contribute to limiting HCV infection, functioning when HLA class I molecules (required for adaptive immunity) are underexpressed.
- Both peripheral and intrahepatic NK cell cytotoxicity are dysfunctional in persistent HCV infection.
- HCV core, NS4B, and NS5B have been shown to suppress the NF-κB pathway, reducing antiapoptotic proteins and increasing vulnerability to TNFα–mediated cell death.
- Patients with unfavorable (non-CC) IL28B alleles have depressed NK cell/innate immune function.
- Viral quasispecies diversity and sequence variation allow the virus to evade host attempts to contain infection by humoral and cellular immunity.
- Cross-reactivity between viral antigens (HCV NS3 and NS5A) and host autoantigens (cytochrome P450 2D6) has been invoked to explain the association between hepatitis C and a subset of patients with autoimmune hepatitis and anti-LKM antibodies.

# Extrahepatic Manifestations

- Immune complex–mediated tissue damage plays a pathogenetic role in some extrahepatic manifestations.
- Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC) is predominantly associated with **chronic HCV infection**, with circulating immune complexes containing HCV RNA.
- EMC is characterized clinically by **arthritis, cutaneous vasculitis (palpable purpura)**, and occasionally glomerulonephritis.
- Immune-complex glomerulonephritis is another recognized extrahepatic manifestation of chronic hepatitis C.
- EMC is part of a spectrum of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, which can rarely evolve to B-cell lymphoma.
- Associations exist between hepatitis C and cutaneous disorders such as porphyria cutanea tarda and lichen planus; the mechanism is unknown.
- Related to HCV's reliance on lipoprotein secretion/assembly and interaction with glucose metabolism, HCV infection can be complicated by **hepatic steatosis, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance** (and metabolic syndrome), and **type 2 diabetes mellitus**.
- Hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance appear to accelerate hepatic fibrosis and blunt responsiveness to interferon-based antiviral therapy.
- Chronic hepatitis C has been linked to multiple extrahepatic disorders, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, rheumatologic/immunologic disorders, **mental health and cognitive disorders** ("brain fog"), and nonliver malignancies (in addition to HCC).
- The anti-LKM seen in some patients with chronic hepatitis C are anti-LKM1, directed against cytochrome P450 2D6.

# Pathology

- The typical morphologic lesions are similar to other viral hepatitis types: panlobular infiltration with mononuclear cells, hepatic cell necrosis, hyperplasia of Kupffer cells, and variable cholestasis. Regeneration is present.
- Mononuclear infiltration is primarily small lymphocytes, occasionally plasma cells and eosinophils.
- Liver cell damage includes degeneration and necrosis, cell dropout, ballooning, and acidophilic degeneration (Councilman or apoptotic bodies).
- Large hepatocytes with ground-glass cytoplasm (containing HBsAg, stained by orcein/aldehyde fuchsin) may be seen in chronic but not acute HBV infection.
- Reticulin framework is preserved in uncomplicated viral hepatitis.
- In hepatitis C, the histologic lesion is often remarkable for a **relative paucity of inflammation**, a marked increase in activation of sinusoidal lining cells, lymphoid aggregates, the presence of **fat (steatosis)** (more frequent in genotype 3 and linked to increased fibrosis), and occasionally bile duct lesions.
- HCV antigens are localized to the cytoplasm.

# Transmission and Epidemiology

- Modes of transmission overlap among hepatitis viruses.
- HCV is primarily transmitted by **percutaneous inoculation**.
- Historically, transfusion-associated hepatitis C was common, classified as "non-A, non-B" hepatitis.
- Before sensitive screening, the risk of acquiring hepatitis C from a transfusion was significant (e.g., 10% per patient, 0.9% per unit in 1970s). Pooled products carried higher risk 20-30%
- Progressive screening measures have reduced the risk of transfusion-associated hepatitis C to almost imperceptible levels (1 in 2.3 million to 1 in 4.7 million transfusions). These measures included excluding commercial donors, relying on volunteer blood, surrogate markers (ALT, anti-HBc, no longer recommended), screening for anti-HIV, and progressively sensitive anti-HCV immunoassays and PCR testing.
- Other percutaneous routes include **injection drug use**, which accounts for most of the HCV reservoir.
- Occupational exposure to blood is a route of transmission, with likelihood increased in hemodialysis units.
- Accidental needle punctures carry an infection efficiency of ~3% for health workers.
- Rare cases occurred in recipients of intravenous immunoglobulin preparations before exclusion of anti-HCV-positive plasma units.
- Serologic evidence of HCV infection is common in patients with a history of transfusion-associated hepatitis (before 1992), hemophiliacs, and injection drug users.
- Many patients with sporadic "non-A, non-B" hepatitis without identifiable risk factors do have anti-HCV.
- 0.5% of volunteer blood donors had anti-HCV in 1999-2002 NHANES.
- Prevalence is higher including excluded high-risk groups (incarcerated, homeless, active IDUs).
- High prevalences occur in certain countries like Egypt (>20%) due to historical contaminated medical equipment/unsafe injection practices.
- In the US, African Americans and Mexican Americans have higher frequencies than whites.
- Peak age prevalence shifted from 30-40 years (1988-1994) to 40-49 years (1999-2002 NHANES).
- Hepatitis C–related mortality increased since 1995, predominantly in the 45-65 age group.
- Prevalence in the population was sustained by an aging cohort infected decades earlier, predominantly by self-inoculation with recreational drugs.
- Phylogenetic mapping suggests the genotype 1a epidemic emerged in the US 1940-1965, peaking 1950, aligning with post-WWII medical procedures (including syringe reuse). HCV was amplified iatrogenically in both Egypt and the US.
- HCV mortality surpassed HIV mortality in 2007 and deaths from all other notifiable infectious diseases by 2012.
- > 70% of HCV-associated deaths occur in the "baby boomer" cohort born 1945-1965. This cohort had a 3.2% prevalence (1999-2002 NHANES), representing three-quarters of all infected persons.
- As of 2020, screening recommendations expanded to all adults aged 18–79 and pregnant women. This is due to DAA efficacy, reduced cost, cost-effectiveness of screening all adults, and shifting demographics towards younger IDUs.
- The annual incidence of new HCV infections has been increasing since 2002, accelerated since 2010 (tripling 2009-2018).
- This increase is amplified by the opioid epidemic in young injection drug users (20-39), accounting for >2/3 acute cases (3.8-fold increase 2010-2017).
- Prevalence in women aged 15–44 (child-bearing age) doubled between 2016 and 2014.
- Sexual and perinatal transmission are **inefficient** for hepatitis C.
- Most studies failed to identify sexual transmission as common, though 10-15% report potential sexual sources.
- Chances of sexual/perinatal transmission estimated ~5%, but a prospective study showed only 1% between monogamous partners, well below HIV and HBV.
- Sexual transmission appears confined to subgroups (multiple partners, STDs, HIV-infected men who have sex with men).
- Breast-feeding does not increase risk for infants.
- Household contact is rare.
- Groups at increased risk for HCV infection are listed in Table 339-4 and include those with prior transfusion/organ transplant (before 1992), history of injection/illicit drug use, chronic hemodialysis, clotting disorders with pre-1987 factors, elevated aminotransferases, health workers with exposure, recipients from HCV+ donors, HIV infection, and children born to HCV+ mothers.

# Clinical Features

- Acute viral hepatitis produces clinically similar illnesses regardless of the agent.
- Acute hepatitis C is less severe during the acute phase than hepatitis B.
- It is more likely to be anicteric (without jaundice).
- Fatalities are rare in acute hepatitis C, but the precise case-fatality rate is unknown.
- The incubation period for hepatitis C ranges from 15 to 160 days (mean, 7 weeks).
- Prodromal symptoms -- precede jaundice by 1-2 weeks -- are systemic and variable (anorexia, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, etc.). Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are often associated with altered smell/taste.
- A low-grade fever is less often present than in hepatitis A or E, very rarely high grade fever 
- Dark urine and clay-colored stools may precede jaundice by 1–5 days.
- With jaundice onset, prodromal symptoms usually diminish, but mild weight loss is common.
- The liver becomes enlarged and tender, sometimes with right upper quadrant pain.
- patients present with a cholestatic picture, suggesting extrahepatic biliary obstruction rarely 
- Splenomegaly and cervical adenopathy occur in 10–20% of acute hepatitis patients.
- Complete clinical and biochemical recovery is expected in 3–4 months after onset of jaundice in three-quarters of uncomplicated, self-limited cases.
- A substantial proportion of patients with viral hepatitis never become icteric.
- Acute infection in immunocompetent adults is self-limited in only ~15-20%.
- The likelihood of remaining chronically infected after acute HCV infection approaches 85–90%.
- Chronic hepatitis follows acute hepatitis C in 50-70% of cases; chronic infection is common even in those with normal ALT levels after acute infection, totaling an 85% likelihood of chronic infection after acute hepatitis C.
- Many patients with chronic hepatitis C have no symptoms.
- Chronic hepatitis C tends to be very slowly and insidiously progressive, if at all, in most patients.
- Most cases are identified initially in asymptomatic patients who have no history of acute hepatitis C.
- Approximately one-third of patients with chronic hepatitis C have normal or near-normal aminotransferase activity.

# Laboratory Features

- Aminotransferases (AST and ALT) increase variably during the prodromal phase and precede bilirubin rise. Levels don't correlate well with liver cell damage.
- Diagnosis of anicteric hepatitis based on clinical features and aminotransferase elevations.
- Jaundice visible when serum bilirubin >43 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). Bilirubin typically 85-340 μmol/L (5–20 mg/dL) with jaundice.
- almost equal conjugate and unconjugated fractions 
- Bilirubin >340 μmol/L (>20 mg/dL) persisting late suggests severe disease.
- Neutropenia and lymphopenia are transient, followed by relative lymphocytosis. Atypical lymphocytes common in acute phase.
- Prolonged prothrombin time (PT) may reflect severe hepatic synthetic defect, extensive necrosis, and indicate worse prognosis.
- Hypoglycemia  -- d/t Prolonged nausea and vomiting, inadequate carbohydrate intake, and poor hepatic glycogen reserves
- Hypoalbuminemia uncommon in uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis. Mild transient steatorrhea, slight microscopic hematuria/proteinuria occasionally noted.
- Mild elevation of γ globulin common in acute viral hepatitis. IgG and IgM elevated in about one-third of acute cases.
- Antibodies to smooth muscle and other cell constituents, low titers of rheumatoid factor, nuclear antibody, heterophile antibody can be found occasionally in acute viral hepatitis.
- In hepatitis C and D, antibodies to LKM may occur; species differ from each other and from autoimmune hepatitis type 2. Autoantibodies in viral hepatitis are nonspecific.
- **Virus-specific antibodies** are serologic markers of diagnostic importance.
- A specific serologic diagnosis of hepatitis C is made by demonstrating **anti-HCV** in serum.
- With contemporary immunoassays, anti-HCV is detectable during the initial phase of elevated aminotransferase activity in acute hepatitis C and remains detectable after recovery (rare) and during chronic infection (common).
- Nonspecificity can confound anti-HCV immunoassays, especially in persons with low prior probability or circulating rheumatoid factor.
- **HCV RNA testing** (molecular amplification by PCR or TMA) distinguishes true-positive from false-positive anti-HCV results.
- Assays for **HCV RNA are the most sensitive tests** for HCV infection and represent the **"gold standard"** in establishing a diagnosis.
- HCV RNA can be detected within a few days of exposure, well before ALT elevation and anti-HCV appearance in acute hepatitis C.
- HCV RNA tends to persist for the duration of infection.
- HCV RNA remains detectable indefinitely, continuously in most but intermittently in some, in patients with chronic hepatitis C. It can be detected in some persons with normal liver tests (inactive carriers).
- If anti-HCV is absent, a diagnosis can be supported by detecting HCV RNA.
- Amplification techniques (PCR) are required to detect HCV RNA.
- Quantitative PCR assays provide a measure of "viral load" (sensitivity 10-25 IU/mL, range 10-10^7 IU/mL).
- HCV RNA level is **not a reliable marker of disease severity or prognosis**. It is helpful in predicting relative responsiveness to antiviral therapy.
- HCV genotype also helps predict relative responsiveness to antiviral therapy.
- HCV RNA monitoring during and after antiviral therapy is the sine qua non for determining on-treatment and durable responsiveness.
- Isolated anti-HBc can be found in some patients with hepatitis C, reflecting a common risk for bloodborne agents (usually remote HBV infection, IgG class, undetectable DNA).
- Detectable anti-HCV in the absence of HCV RNA signifies spontaneous or therapeutically induced recovery ("cured").
- In chronic hepatitis C, aminotransferase levels tend to fluctuate more (episodic pattern) and be lower than in chronic hepatitis B, especially in long-standing disease.
- Hypergammaglobulinemia is common in autoimmune hepatitis but distinctly absent in chronic hepatitis B. In autoimmune hepatitis, high globulin levels can cause false-positive immunoassays for anti-HCV.
- Some chronic hepatitis C patients have circulating anti-LKM1, same as in autoimmune hepatitis type 2, directed against cytochrome P450 2D6.

# Diagnosis

- The most accurate means to distinguish viral hepatitis types involves specific serologic testing.
- A diagnostic algorithm for acute viral hepatitis includes anti-HCV testing. The presence of anti-HCV supports a diagnosis of acute hepatitis C.
- HCV RNA testing or repeat anti-HCV testing later may be necessary.
- In chronic hepatitis, initial testing should include anti-HCV.
- Anti-HCV supports and HCV RNA testing establishes the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C.
- In immunosuppressed individuals, anti-HCV may be undetectable; diagnosis may require HCV RNA testing.

# Disease Progression and Complications

- Chronic hepatitis C occurs in 50-70% of cases after acute infection, with an overall likelihood of chronic infection after acute HCV of up to 85-90%.
- Progression to cirrhosis occurs in ~20-25% of patients over 20 years. Some referral centers report up to 50% progression to cirrhosis.
- The long-term prognosis over 1–2 decades for chronic hepatitis C is relatively benign in most patients.
- Mortality over 10-20 years in transfused patients with chronic hepatitis C has been shown not to differ from transfused controls without hepatitis C.
- Death in the hepatitis group is more likely from liver failure.
- Hepatic decompensation may occur in ~15% over a decade.
- The majority (~60%) of patients remain asymptomatic and well compensated.
- Chronic hepatitis C tends to be slowly and insidiously progressive in most patients, but ~one-fourth will progress eventually to end-stage cirrhosis.
- Prior to high-efficacy DAA therapy, hepatitis C was the most frequent indication for liver transplantation.
- Hepatitis C accounts for up to 40% of all chronic liver disease.
- As of 2007, mortality from hepatitis C surpassed HIV/AIDS; as of 2012, it surpassed deaths from all other notifiable infectious diseases combined.
- Progression of liver disease is more likely with **older age, longer duration of infection, advanced histologic stage and grade, more complex HCV quasispecies, increased hepatic iron, concomitant liver disorders** (alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis B, hemochromatosis, α1 antitrypsin deficiency, steatohepatitis), **HIV infection, and obesity**.
- **Duration of infection** appears to be one of the most important factors influencing progression.
- No other epidemiologic or clinical features predict eventual outcome (e.g., severity of acute hepatitis, ALT level, HCV RNA level, jaundice during acute illness).
- The best prognostic indicator is liver histology, specifically the rate of hepatic fibrosis.
- Mild necrosis, inflammation, or limited fibrosis implies an excellent prognosis and limited progression.
- Moderate to severe necroinflammatory activity or fibrosis (septal/bridging) makes progression to cirrhosis highly likely over 10-20 years.
- Fibrosis pace can be accelerated by concomitant HIV, other liver diseases, excessive alcohol, steatosis.
- Among patients with compensated cirrhosis, the 10-year survival rate is close to 80%. Mortality is 2-6% per year; decompensation is 4-5% per year; HCC is 1-4% per year.
- Cirrhosis following chronic hepatitis C is associated with the late development of **HCC**, almost exclusively in patients with cirrhosis, usually after several decades (typically >30 years).
- The annual risk of HCC in cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C is **1–4%**.
- Fulminant hepatitis is hardly ever seen in hepatitis C.
- Rarely, autoimmune hepatitis can be triggered by an otherwise self-limited bout of acute hepatitis A, B, or C.

# Treatment

- Therapy for chronic hepatitis C has evolved substantially since IFN-α was introduced in 1991.
- **IFN-based therapy** (1991–2011):
    - Subcutaneous IFN-α three times a week for 6 months achieved <10% SVR (undetectable HCV RNA ≥24 weeks post-treatment).
    - Doubling duration increased SVR to ~20%.
    - Adding daily ribavirin (oral guanosine nucleoside, ineffective alone) increased SVR to 40% by reducing relapse.
    - PEG IFN + ribavirin increased SVR to 55% overall (genotypes 1/4 >40% over 48 wks, genotypes 2/3 >80% over 24 wks).
    - Histologic improvement in ~three-fourths.
    - ALT fell precipitously after IFN.
    - RVR (undetectable RNA by 4 wks) -> high likelihood SVR.
    - EVR (≥2-log10 RNA reduction by 12 wks) failure predicted SVR failure.
    - SVR12 (undetectable RNA 12 wks post-treatment) became the standard for SVR, equivalent to SVR24.
    - Relapses rare after SVR, almost unheard of after 2 years.
    - **SVR is tantamount to a cure**, followed by marked improvements in liver-disease outcomes.
    - Patient variables correlating with higher IFN-based SVR: favorable genotype (2,3>1,4; 1b>1a), low baseline RNA (<800k), low quasispecies, mild histology (no cirrhosis), immunocompetence, low liver iron, age <40, female, absence of obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, steatosis.
    - IFN gene variants (IL28B/IFNL3 C/C) correlated significantly with higher SVR to PEG IFN+ribavirin (genotype 1).
    - Side effects of IFN: flu-like, marrow suppression, emotional lability, autoimmune reactions (thyroiditis), alopecia, rashes, diarrhea, numbness/tingling. Reversible.
    - Side effects of ribavirin: nasal/chest congestion, pruritus, gout, **hemolysis** (requires monitoring, dose reduction, sometimes erythropoietin).
    - **Ribavirin is teratogenic**; contraception required during and for several months after therapy in women of child-bearing age.
    - IFNs also contraindicated in pregnancy (antiproliferative).
    - Combination IFN-ribavirin more difficult to tolerate than IFN monotherapy, more dose reductions/discontinuations.
    - PEG IFNs (once weekly) supplanted standard IFNs (three times weekly). PEG IFN-α2a slightly better tolerated/effective than PEG IFN-α2b.
    - Responsiveness diminished in immunocompromised, HIV-HCV co-infection. Contraindicated in decompensated liver disease, end-stage renal disease.
    - Cumbersome nature supplanted by DAAs.
    - Successful therapy (SVR) improves survival, reduces need for transplant, lowers risk of liver failure/death, slows progression, **reverses fibrosis/cirrhosis**, improves extrahepatic disorders (diabetes, renal).
    - Cirrhotic patients with SVR have similar survival to general population.
    - In cirrhotic/advanced fibrosis patients, SVR reduces HCC risk (14-fold 10-year reduction), but risk persists, necessitating continued monitoring/surveillance.
    - IFN-based therapy without SVR doesn't reduce HCC risk.
- **First-generation Protease Inhibitors** (2011–2013):
    - Telaprevir and boceprevir (NS3/4A inhibitors) approved 2011 for genotype 1 only.
    - Required combination with PEG IFN+ribavirin. Ribavirin reduced relapse rates.
    - Triple therapy (PI+PEG IFN+ribavirin) and dual therapy phases, response-guided duration.
    - Improved SVR rates compared to PEG IFN+ribavirin alone for genotype 1 (66-79% vs 38-44%).
    - Substantial toxicities: Telaprevir (severe rash, anemia, pruritus, GI symptoms), Boceprevir (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, GI symptoms).
    - High pill burden, frequent dosing with food. Numerous drug-drug interactions (CYP3A4). Consult www.hep-druginteractions.org.
    - Obsolete, no longer recommended or available.
- **Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) Combinations** (since 2014):
    - As of 2020, five all-oral, IFN-free, highly effective (>95% SVR), well tolerated, low resistance, pangenotypic (mostly), short duration (8-12 wks) combination regimens are recommended.
    - DAA classes: NS3/4 protease inhibitors (-previr), NS5B polymerase inhibitors (-buvir), NS5A inhibitors (-asvir).
    - **Sofosbuvir** (polymerase inhibitor): pangenotypic, high potency, high barrier to resistance, well tolerated, once daily oral, few major drug-drug interactions. Used in combinations.
    - **Sofosbuvir-ledipasvir** (polymerase + NS5A): Fixed-dose single pill. Approved Oct 2014 (genotype 1), Nov 2015 (4, 5, 6). 12 wks achieved 97-99% SVR12 in naive noncirrhotics. 8 wks effective for naive noncirrhotic genotype 1 with low RNA. Highly effective in compensated/decompensated cirrhosis, post-transplant. Approved for advanced renal failure Nov 2019.
    - **Severe bradycardia with amiodarone** (esp. with beta blockers), contraindicated with sofosbuvir-containing combos.
    - Few drug-drug interactions, but P-glycoprotein inducers and PPIs may reduce levels. Responsiveness not reduced by baseline RASs, except in treatment-experienced with baseline NS5A RASs.
    - Paritaprevir-ritonavir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir (PI + NS5A + nonnucleoside PI + ritonavir booster): Approved Dec 2014 (genotypes 1, 4). Dosed once/twice daily. SVR12 87-100% genotype 1/4 naive/experienced. Required ribavirin for genotype 1a, not 1b. Well tolerated, mild side effects. Potential hepatotoxicity, **contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis**. Safe/effective in advanced renal insufficiency. Drug-drug interactions common (CYP3A4). Check interactions (www.hep-druginteractions.org). Supplanted, no longer AASLD recommended, alternative for 1b in EASL.
    - Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir (polymerase + NS5A): Approved July 2015 (genotype 3), Feb 2016 (genotype 1). Recommended for genotypes 1-6 in Europe. Separate pills once daily for 12-24 wks. SVR12 89-98% depending on genotype. Less effective in decompensated cirrhosis (56% class C) and genotype 3 prior nonresponders (69%). Well tolerated but could cause severe bradycardia with amiodarone. Drug-drug interactions (CYP3A). Supplanting by newer DAAs, no longer recommended.
    - Elbasvir-grazoprevir (NS5A + PI): Fixed-dose single pill. Approved Jan 2016 (genotypes 1, 4). Once daily. 12 wks effective naive/experienced noncirrhotic/compensated cirrhotic (92-100% SVR12). ~11% genotype 1a have baseline NS5A RASs reducing efficacy (from 99% to 58% in naive). Baseline RAS testing required for genotype 1a. With RASs, 16 wks + ribavirin increased SVR. Effective in HIV-HCV, advanced renal failure (including hemodialysis). **Contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis**. Potential hepatotoxicity, monitor ALT. Well tolerated, mild side effects. Drug-drug interactions (CYP3A, OATP1B1). Check interactions (www.hep-druginteractions.org). Requires baseline RAS testing, but comparable for various subgroups/renal function. One of currently recommended combinations (Table 341-6).
    - **Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir** (polymerase + highly potent, pangenotypic NS5A): Fixed-dose single pill. Approved June 2016 (genotypes 1-6), Aug 2017 (HCV-HIV). 12 wks SVR12 ~99% in genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 (95% genotype 3) naive/experienced noncirrhotics/cirrhotics. Ribavirin not required, except decompensated cirrhosis. Baseline NS5A RASs no impact. Highest SVR12 for genotype 3 cirrhotic null responders among IFN-free DAAs. Highly effective in decompensated class B cirrhosis (with ribavirin). Very well tolerated, mild side effects. **Do not administer with amiodarone**. Drug-drug interactions (P-glycoprotein inducers, CYP3A inducers). Check interactions (www.hep-druginteractions.org). One of currently recommended DAA combinations (Table 341-6). Recommended as preferred, simplified treatment algorithm (AASLD, EASL).
    - Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir (polymerase + NS5A + pangenotypic PI): Approved July 2017. Pangenotypic, high barrier, well tolerated. ~97% SVR12 across all genotypes/subgroups, includes prior DAA failures (genotype 1, 3 refractory to prior combos). Efficacy independent of prior DAA classes/NS5A RASs. 8-week course inferior to 12-week. Mild side effects.
    - Recommendations limited to small subset of otherwise refractory patients (specific genotype 3 cases, prior failed NS5A combo). Consult www.hcvguidelines.org. **Contraindicated with amiodarone**. **Contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis**. Concomitant omeprazole ok (20mg). Check interactions recommended.
    - **Glecaprevir-pibrentasvir** (PI + NS5A): Fixed-dose single pill. Approved Aug 2017. Two pangenotypic, high potency, high barriers. **8 wks achieves SVR12 close to 100%** naive all genotypes +/- cirrhosis. 12 wks for experienced patients (except genotype 3). SVR rates fall with increasing prior treatment courses or baseline NS5A RASs.
    - Retreatment options after failure exist (with additional drugs or extended duration).
    - **Contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis**. SVR12 98% stage 4/5 renal disease. Preferred treatment for severe renal impairment. Take with food. Check interactions. Simple, broadly effective. Recommended as preferred, simplified treatment algorithm (AASLD, EASL).

# Treatment Recommendations

- Refer to www.hcvguidelines.org (AASLD/IDSA) and www.easl.eu (EASL) for updated recommendations. Divergences exist (Table 341-6).
- Determine HCV genotype before therapy.
- Monitor serum HCV RNA levels before, during, and after treatment. Baseline RNA level may influence duration.
- Goal is to eradicate HCV RNA during therapy and document undetectable levels for at least 12 weeks after (SVR12).
- Screen for **HBV infection** before initiating DAA therapy for hepatitis C.
- Treat HBV if meeting criteria, initiate prior or simultaneously with HCV therapy. Hepatitis B reactivation has been reported during/after DAA therapy in HCV-HBV co-infected patients not treated for HBV.
- Patients with detectable HCV RNA are candidates for DAA therapy, regardless of ALT levels or grade/stage of chronic hepatitis. Exception: short life expectancy.
- Early treatment is a high priority for patients with advanced liver disease.
- Patients with persistently normal ALT also respond well and are candidates. Therapy for mild disease is justified and cost-effective to prevent complications.
- Absence/presence of cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis determines regimen options, duration, and need for ribavirin.
- Noninvasive measures of fibrosis (elastography, FIB-4 score) have supplanted histology in most cases for assessing stage.
- Cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis at baseline indicates a residual risk of HCC after SVR. **Continued twice-yearly imaging surveillance for HCC** is recommended after SVR for anyone with baseline advanced fibrosis.
- Endoscopic surveillance for esophageal varices (1-3 year intervals) is indicated in cirrhotics.
- Low-level fibrosis at baseline allows cessation of surveillance after SVR.
- Patients who relapsed/failed prior IFN or DAA therapy are candidates for retreatment. Options include extended duration, adding ribavirin, or changing drug class.
- For failed DAA combos, RAS testing and tailored therapy may be used, or add ribavirin/extend duration.
- Prior IFN nonresponders respond well to NS5A inhibitor-containing regimens, but reduced response can occur, especially in cirrhotics.
- **PI-containing regimens (elbasvir-grazoprevir, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir) are contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis**.
- **Sofosbuvir-containing regimens are not recommended with amiodarone**.
- Sofosbuvir-containing DAA combinations are approved for advanced renal failure (Nov 2019).

# Treatment in Special Populations

- **Acute Hepatitis C**: Earlier delaying treatment for 3-6 months was done during interferoon therapy, but now **treat with 1 1st line drug combination immediately** . Candidates for DAA therapy, using the same pangenotypic combo agents and duration as chronic hepatitis C. Delaying therapy for spontaneous recovery is not recommended. EASL recommends an 8-12 week DAA regimen.
- **Compensated Cirrhosis**: Respond to DAA, comparable SVR to noncirrhotics.
- **Decompensated Cirrhosis**: Respond well to DAA combos of polymerase and NS5A inhibitors (sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir). PI-containing combos are contraindicated. Ribavirin should be added to a 12-week sofosbuvir-NS5A course. If ribavirin ineligible, extend duration to 24 weeks. Prior failed sofosbuvir-NS5A: repeat regimen + ribavirin, extend to 24 wks. Should be referred to a liver transplantation center.
- **End-Stage Liver Disease/Liver Transplantation**: DAAs are highly effective for patients awaiting transplant and those with recurrent hepatitis C after transplant. Ideally, treat pre-transplant. Concern exists about disqualifying from HCV+ donor organs (shrinking pool). Response reduced in decompensated cirrhosis with high MELD scores pre-transplant; post-transplant response better. Individualize decision for high-MELD patients. Many centers accept HCV+ donors for HCV- recipients and treat post-transplant with DAAs (e.g., sofosbuvir-velpatasvir 12 wks, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir 8 wks) with excellent results.
- **Essential Mixed Cryoglobulinemia (EMC)**: DAA (12 wks sofosbuvir-based combo) has shown >80% SVR12 in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.
- **Porphyria Cutanea Tarda/Lichen Planus**: Anecdotal reports suggest IFN effective; DAA efficacy TBD.
- **HCV/HIV Co-infection**: More progressive/severe hepatitis C. Respond as well as mono-infected to DAA combo regimens. Abbreviated 8-week courses may not be recommended (e.g., sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir for genotype 4). Ribavirin can potentiate toxicity of some HIV drugs (didanosine, stavudine, zidovudine); avoid these combinations with ribavirin. **Extensive drug-drug interaction list** exists, check carefully (www.hcvguidelines.org).
- **Injection Drug Use/Alcoholism**: Can be treated successfully, preferably with drug/alcohol treatment programs. Treating active IDUs reduces transmission.
- **Renal Impairment**: DAA combos effective in mild-mod renal failure, no dose adjustment. Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, hemodialysis): recommended combos are 12 wks elbasvir-grazoprevir (1,4) or 12 wks glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (all genotypes). SVR12 approaches 100%. Sofosbuvir combos initially not recommended for severe impairment, but approved Nov 2019 based on data.
- **Pregnancy**: No DAA clinical studies during pregnancy. **Ribavirin is contraindicated** (teratogenic). Some DAAs (sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, paritaprevir-ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir) classified pregnancy category B. Not routinely indicated, use with caution if benefit compelling. Screening pregnant women for HCV is recommended. Breast feeding not contraindicated unless nipple integrity issues or HIV co-infection.
- **Choosing Among Available Options**: The number of recommended DAAs has narrowed. Fixed-dose, single-pill, pangenotypic combos are popular. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir and glecaprevir-pibrentasvir are recommended as preferred, simplified treatment algorithms for most treatment-naïve patients +/- cirrhosis, including advanced renal failure, HIV-HCV.
- Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir is limited in naive patients, reserved for cirrhotic genotype 3.
- **PI-containing regimens are contraindicated in decompensated cirrhosis**.

# Prevention

- Immunoglobulin (IG) is ineffective in preventing hepatitis C and is no longer recommended for postexposure prophylaxis.
- Hepatitis C vaccination is not practically feasible currently due to viral heterogeneity, high mutation rate, and rapid evasion of neutralizing antibodies.
- Prevention relies on **behavior changes and precautions to limit exposures** to infected persons.
- Screening helps identify infected persons.
- Anti-HCV testing is recommended for all persons 18 years or older, regardless of risk factors.
- Specific high-risk groups should be screened (Table 339-4).
- For stable, monogamous sexual partners, sexual transmission is unlikely; barrier precautions are not recommended.
- For persons with multiple sexual partners or STDs, the risk is increased, and barrier precautions (latex condoms) are recommended.
- Avoid sharing items like razors, toothbrushes, and nail clippers within households.
- No special precautions/restriction for breast-feeding by HCV-positive mothers.

* drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
	* most common cause of acute liver failure 
	* Most common reason for failure to approval in drug trials 
* Mechanism of DILI 
	* Direct hepatocyte injury 
		* by free-radical or metabolic intermediate that causes peroxidation of membrane lipids
	* may activate components of the innate or adaptive immune system, 
	* stimulate apoptotic pathways, or 
	* initiate damage to bile excretory pathways
	* Interfere with canalicular pumps allow accumulation of bile acids 
	* metabolites sensitize hepatocytes to toxic cytokines

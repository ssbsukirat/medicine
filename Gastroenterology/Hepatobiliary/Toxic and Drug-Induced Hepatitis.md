 * drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
	* most common cause of acute liver failure 
	* Most common reason for failure to approval in drug trials 
* Mechanism of DILI 
	* Direct hepatocyte injury 
		* by free-radical or metabolic intermediate that causes peroxidation of membrane lipids
	* may activate components of the innate or adaptive immune system, 
	* stimulate apoptotic pathways, or 
	* initiate damage to bile excretory pathways
	* Interfere with canalicular pumps allow accumulation of bile acids 
	* metabolites sensitize hepatocytes to toxic cytokines 
# Drug metabolism 
* water insoluble drugs undergo steps to become water soluble 
* begins with oxidation or methylation by cytochrome P450 (Phase 1)
	* Toxic metabolite formation most common cause of hepatotoxicity 
* Glucuronidation or sulfation (phase 2) or
* Glutathione inactivation 
# LIVER INJURY CAUSED BY DRUGS 
* 2 major types 
	* Direct 
		* predictable 
		* dose dependent 
		* short onset within hours 
		* direct toxins produce characteristic morphology which is reproducible 
			* carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene --> centrilobular necrosis
	* Idiosyncratic 
		* infrequent 
		* unpredictable 
		* not dose dependent 
		* 5-90 days after exposure 
		* adaptation 
			* mild, transient, nonprogressive serum aminotransferase elevations that resolve with continued drug use 
			* isoniazid (INH), valproate, phenytoin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)
		* extrahepatic manifestations 
			* rash, 
			* arthralgias, 
			* fever, 
			* leukocytosis 
			* eosinophilia,
		* maybe autoimmune mediated, influenced by HLA 
		* autoimmune with ANA ++ 
			* nitrofurantoin , minocycline, hydralazine and alpha-methyldopa 
		* morphology variable 
			* hepatocellular injury most common 
* Severity of drug induced cholestasis 
	* Bland with limited hepatocellular injury 
		* estrogens, 17,α-substituted androgens);
	* inflammatory cholestasis
		* amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (most common cause of DILI ) oxacillin, erythromycin estolate); 
	* sclerosing cholangitis
		* after intrahepatic infusion of the chemotherapeutic agent floxuridine for hepatic metastases 
	* disappearance of bile ducts, “ductopenic” cholestasis or vanishing bile duct syndrome, 
		* similar to that observed in chronic rejectionfollowing liver transplantation
		* carbamazepine, levofloxacin
* Cholestasis vs Hepatocellular injury 
	* R value decides 
	* ALT / ALP ratio 
	* >5.0 is hepatocellular injury 
	* <2.0 is cholestasis 
	* 2-5 is mixed pattern 
* ![[dili-features.png]]
* Morphological patterns 
	* Hepatic granulomas in sulfonamide use 
	* Steatohepatitis
	    * Mitochondrial toxicity
	    * Antiretroviral drugs 
	    * Now discontinued
	* Sinusoidal lining cells
	    * High dose chemotherapy
	    * Cyclophosphamide, melphalan, busulfan 
	    * Veno occlusive disease may occur
	* Nodular regenerative hyperplasia
	    * Vascular injury to portal or hepatic venous endothelium
	    * Form of portal Hypertension
	    * Oxaliplatin 
	    * Colon cancer treatment
	    * Vitamin A intake 
* OCP induced cholestasis 
    * Neither toxic nor idiosyncratic
    * Elevated LFTs or jaundice 
    * No morphological changes or sign of hypersensitivity
    * More in women with cholestasis of pregnancy
    * Genetic susceptibility
    * Multidrug resistance-associated canalicular transporter proteins 
    * FNH or hepatic adenoma may form
    * HCC and Budd Chiari rare 
    * ***Peliosis hepatis*** is liver blood cysts with anabolic or contraceptive steroids 
* Idiosyncratic reactions
    * Maybe missed in trial if <1:10000
    * Needs surrogate marker 
    * ***Hys law***
        * Hyman Zimmerman
        * ***If jaundice occurs during stage 3 of clinical trial, severe liver toxicity was likely,*** 
        * at a ***ratio of 10:1*** of jaundice to acute liver failure 
* Diagnosis of DILI
    * Presumptive diagnosis
    * Causality difficult
    * Several supportive variables required
    * Temporal association
    * Clinical biochemical features
    * Hepatocellular vs cholestatic 
    * Extrahepatic manifestation
    * Known agent to cause Dili
    * Scoring systems
        * Roussel-Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM)
        * Uncertainty present so not clinically used 
* Generally CLD does not increase risk of DILI but may raise severity of episode
* CLD increases risk 
    * Aspirin
    * Methotrexate
    * INH 
    * Antiretroviral
* Treatment
    * Supportive
    * Acetaminophen toxicity
        * N-acetylcysteine 
    * ALF in 10% of patients
        * Spontaneous recovery in 30%
        * Transplantation in 40% 
    * Withdrawal of agent if ***aminotransferase >5x elevation***
    * Agents +/- effectiveness
        * Glucocorticoids
        * UDCA 
    * N-acetylcysteine shows usefulness in some patients in early phases but not yet approved

# Acetaminophen toxicity
* Direct toxin 
* May progress to coagulopathy or encephalopathy
* Dose related centrilobular hepatic necrosis
* Opioid-acetaminophen combination maybe more harmful as habituation may occur to opioid leading to higher doses 
* Dosage
    * 8g/ day for several days may cause 
    * 10-15g single dose may cause liver injury
    * 25g may cause fatal fulminant failure
    * >300ug/mL 4 hours after ingestion suggest severe damage
    * <150ug levels unlikely to cause injury
* Manifestation
    * Early (4-12h) 
        * Vomiting
        * Diarrhoea
        * Abdominal pain
        * Shock 
    * 24-48h 
        * Hepatic injury becomes more apparent
    * 3-5 days 
        * Max abnormalities
        * Liver failure
        * Aminotransferase >10000 may occur 
        * Renal failure
        * Myocardial injury
* Extremely high aminotransferase with low bilirubin is characteristic

* drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
	* most common cause of acute liver failure 
	* Most common reason for failure to approval in drug trials 
* Mechanism of DILI 
	* Direct hepatocyte injury 
		* by free-radical or metabolic intermediate that causes peroxidation of membrane lipids
	* may activate components of the innate or adaptive immune system, 
	* stimulate apoptotic pathways, or 
	* initiate damage to bile excretory pathways
	* Interfere with canalicular pumps allow accumulation of bile acids 
	* metabolites sensitize hepatocytes to toxic cytokines 
# Drug metabolism 
* water insoluble drugs undergo steps to become water soluble 
* begins with oxidation or methylation by cytochrome P450 (Phase 1)
	* Toxic metabolite formation most common cause of hepatotoxicity 
* Glucuronidation or sulfation (phase 2) or
* Glutathione inactivation 
# LIVER INJURY CAUSED BY DRUGS 
* 2 major types 
	* Direct 
		* predictable 
		* dose dependent 
		* short onset within hours 
		* direct toxins produce characteristic morphology which is reproducible 
			* carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene --> centrilobular necrosis
	* Idiosyncratic 
		* infrequent 
		* unpredictable 
		* not dose dependent 
		* 5-90 days after exposure 
		* adaptation 
			* mild, transient, nonprogressive serum aminotransferase elevations that resolve with continued drug use 
			* isoniazid (INH), valproate, phenytoin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)
		* extrahepatic manifestations 
			* rash, 
			* arthralgias, 
			* fever, 
			* leukocytosis 
			* eosinophilia,
		* maybe autoimmune mediated, influenced by HLA 
		* autoimmune with ANA ++ 
			* nitrofurantoin , minocycline, hydralazine and alpha-methyldopa 
		* morphology variable 
			* hepatocellular injury most common 
* Severity of drug induced cholestasis 
	* Bland with limited hepatocellular injury 
		* estrogens, 17,α-substituted androgens);
	* inflammatory cholestasis
		* amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (most common cause of DILI ) oxacillin, erythromycin estolate); 
	* sclerosing cholangitis
		* after intrahepatic infusion of the chemotherapeutic agent floxuridine for hepatic metastases 
	* disappearance of bile ducts, “ductopenic” cholestasis or vanishing bile duct syndrome, 
		* similar to that observed in chronic rejectionfollowing liver transplantation
		* carbamazepine, levofloxacin
* Cholestasis vs Hepatocellular injury 
	* R value decides 
	* ALT / ALP ratio 
	* >5.0 is hepatocellular injury 
	* <2.0 is cholestasis 
	* 2-5 is mixed pattern

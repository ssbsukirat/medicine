# Etiology 
- Gallstones (30-60%) and Alcohol account for 80-90% 
- more risk if gallstones <5mm (if single is <5mm there is 4x increase risk) 
- Alcohol alone is low but with smoking and genetic predisposition high risk 
- 5-10% of post-ERCP have pancreatitis but reduced with 
	- proper patient selection
	- prophylactic pancreatic duct stent 
	- rectal NSAIDs like indomethacin 
- risk factors for post-ERCP 
	- minor papilla sphincterotomy 
	- suspected Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction 
	- Prior history of post-ERCP pancreatitis 
	- age<60 
	- >2 contrast in pancreatic duct 
	- endoscopy experience 
- Hypertriglyceridemia in 1-4% 
	- TGs >1000 
	- most have uncontrolled or undiagnosed Diabetes 
	- may have underlying derangements in lipid metabolism 
	- Alcohol or drugs like OCP may cause abrupt TGs increase and pancreatitis 
- Apolipoprotein C2 have increase incidence 
	- activates lipoprotein lipase which clears chylomicron from blood 
- Drug related are <2%

- Pathologically 
	- Interstitial Pancreatitis 
		- blood supply maintain 
	- Necrotising Pancreatitis

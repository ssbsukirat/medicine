# Etiology 
- Gallstones (30-60%) and Alcohol account for 80-90% 
- more risk if gallstones <5mm (if single is <5mm there is 4x increase risk) 
- Alcohol alone is low but with smoking and genetic predisposition high risk 
- 5-10% of post-ERCP have pancreatitis but reduced with 
	- proper patient selection
	- prophylactic pancreatic duct stent 
	- rectal NSAIDs like indomethacin 
- risk factors for post-ERCP 
	- minor papilla sphincterotomy 
	- suspected Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction 
	- Prior history of post-ERCP pancreatitis 
	- age<60 
	- >2 contrast in pancreatic duct 
	- endoscopy experience 
- Hypertriglyceridemia in 1-4% 
	- TGs >1000 
	- most have uncontrolled or undiagnosed Diabetes 
	- may have underlying derangements in lipid metabolism 
	- Alcohol or drugs like OCP may cause abrupt TGs increase and pancreatitis 
- Apolipoprotein C2 have increase incidence 
	- activates lipoprotein lipase which clears chylomicron from blood 
- Drug related are <2% 
- ![[etiologyPancreatitis.png]]
- Pathologically 
	- Interstitial Pancreatitis 
		- blood supply maintain 
	- Necrotising Pancreatitis 
		- cut off blood supply 
	- Auto-digestion is accepted theory 
# Enzyme activation in Pathogenesis 
- 3 phases 
	- Initial 
		- intrapancreatic digestive enzyme activation 
		- acinar cell injury 
		- ***Trypsin activation*** mediated by lysosomal hydrolases such as ***cathepsin B*** that become colocalized with digestive enzymes in intracellular organelles
		- acinar cell injury is the consequence of trypsin activation
	- Second 
		- activation, chemoattraction, and sequestration of leukocytes and macrophages in the pancreas, 
		- causes enhanced intrapancreatic inflammatory reaction 
		- Neutrophil have role in trypsin activation 
			- early neutrophil independent 
			- late neutrophil dependent 
	- Third 
		- effects of activated proteolytic enzymes and cytokines on distant organs 
		- trypsin and others activate other enzymes such as elastase and phospholipase A2
		- digest cellular membranes and cause proteolysis, edema, interstitial hemorrhage, vascular damage, coagulation necrosis, fat necrosis, and cellular necrosis in the parenchyma.
		- Cellular injury and death result in the liberation of bradykinin peptides, vasoactive substances, and histamine 
		- produce vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and edema with profound effects on other organs
		- may lead to SIRS, [[Acute Respiratory distress syndrome - ARDS]], multiorgan failure 
- Genetic factors 
	- center on control of trypsin activity in acinar cell 
	- 6 genetic variants 
		- cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) -- only which can precipitate isolated, rest others need other risk factors 
		- pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1) 
		- cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR)
		- chymotrypsin C gene (CTRC)
		- calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) 
		- claudin-2 (CLDN2)
# Approach 
- Abdominal pain is predominant symptom 
	- mild to severe and constant incapacitating distress 
	- epigastric , steady, boring, 
	- radiate to back chest flanks and lower abdomen 
- nausea, vomiting , abdominal distension 
- Examine 
	- distressed, anxious 
	- low-grade fever, tachycardia , hypotension 
	- shock 
		- hypovolemia secondary to blood and protein exudates in retroperitoneum 
		- increased formation and release of kinin peptides, which cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability 
		- systemic effects of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes 
	- Jaundice 
		- infrequent 
		- due to compression from pancreatic edema 
		- pancreatic head mass 
		- CBD stone or sludhe 
	- erythematous skin nodule

# Etiology 
- Gallstones (30-60%) and Alcohol account for 80-90% 
- more risk if gallstones <5mm (if single is <5mm there is 4x increase risk) 
- Alcohol alone is low but with smoking and genetic predisposition high risk 
- 5-10% of post-ERCP have pancreatitis but reduced with 
	- proper patient selection
	- prophylactic pancreatic duct stent 
	- rectal NSAIDs like indomethacin 
- risk factors for post-ERCP 
	- minor papilla sphincterotomy 
	- suspected Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction 
	- Prior history of post-ERCP pancreatitis 
	- age<60 
	- >2 contrast in pancreatic duct 
	- endoscopy experience 
- Hypertriglyceridemia in 1-4% 
	- TGs >1000 
	- most have uncontrolled or undiagnosed Diabetes 
	- may have underlying derangements in lipid metabolism 
	- Alcohol or drugs like OCP may cause abrupt TGs increase and pancreatitis 
- Apolipoprotein C2 have increase incidence 
	- activates lipoprotein lipase which clears chylomicron from blood 
- Drug related are <2% 
- ![[etiologyPancreatitis.png]]
- Pathologically 
	- Interstitial Pancreatitis 
		- blood supply maintain 
	- Necrotising Pancreatitis 
		- cut off blood supply 
	- Auto-digestion is accepted theory 
# Enzyme activation in Pathogenesis 
- 3 phases 
	- Initial 
		- intrapancreatic digestive enzyme activation 
		- acinar cell injury 
		- ***Trypsin activation*** mediated by lysosomal hydrolases such as ***cathepsin B*** that become colocalized with digestive enzymes in intracellular organelles
		- acinar cell injury is the consequence of trypsin activation
	- Second 
		- activation, chemoattraction, and sequestration of leukocytes and macrophages in the pancreas, 
		- causes enhanced intrapancreatic inflammatory reaction 
		- Neutrophil have role in trypsin activation 
			- early neutrophil independent 
			- late neutrophil dependent 
	- Third 
		- effects of activated proteolytic enzymes and cytokines on distant organs 
		- trypsin and others activate other enzymes such as elastase and phospholipase A2
		- digest cellular membranes and cause proteolysis, edema, interstitial hemorrhage, vascular damage, coagulation necrosis, fat necrosis, and cellular necrosis in the parenchyma.
		- Cellular injury and death result in the liberation of bradykinin peptides, vasoactive substances, and histamine 
		- produce vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and edema with profound effects on other organs
		- may lead to SIRS, [[Acute Respiratory distress syndrome - ARDS]], multiorgan failure 
- Genetic factors 
	- center on control of trypsin activity in acinar cell 
	- 6 genetic variants 
		- cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) -- only which can precipitate isolated, rest others need other risk factors 
		- pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1) 
		- cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR)
		- chymotrypsin C gene (CTRC)
		- calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) 
		- claudin-2 (CLDN2)
# Approach 
- Abdominal pain is predominant symptom 
	- mild to severe and constant incapacitating distress 
	- epigastric , steady, boring, 
	- radiate to back chest flanks and lower abdomen 
- nausea, vomiting , abdominal distension 
- Examine 
	- distressed, anxious 
	- low-grade fever, tachycardia , hypotension 
	- shock 
		- hypovolemia secondary to blood and protein exudates in retroperitoneum 
		- increased formation and release of kinin peptides, which cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability 
		- systemic effects of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes 
	- Jaundice 
		- infrequent 
		- due to compression from pancreatic edema 
		- pancreatic head mass 
		- CBD stone or sludhe 
	- erythematous skin nodules due to subcutaneous fat necrosis 
	- pulmonary findings in 10-20% 
		- basilar rales 
		- atelectasis 
		- pleural effusion (most commonly left sided)
	- Abdominal 
		- tenderness 
		- muscle rigidity 
		- dimnished or absent bowel sounds 
	- Pancreas 
		- enlarged from acute fluid collections , walled-off necrosis or pseudocyst in later course (4-6 weeks) 
	- Cullen's sign 
		- blue discolouration around umblicus 
		- due to hemoperitoneum 
	- Turners Sign 
		- blue-red-purple or green-brown discolouration of flanks 
		- tissue breakdown of hemoglobin 
		- severe necrotising pancreatitis 
# Laboratory 
- Amylase and Lipase 3x or more above normal 
	- exclude alternate like gut perforation , ischemia , infarct
	- no correlation between degree of severity 
	- 3-7 days later amylase returns to normal 
	- Lipase elevated 7-14 days 
	- Other conditions of elevation later to be done 
	- Acidemia (<7.32) may elevate Amylase falsely (DKA may have amylase high without pancreatitis ) 
	- Spurious low amylase in hypertriglyceridemia 
	- Lipase more specific than amyase 
- Leucocytosis 
	- 15000-20000 
	- frequently 
- hemoconcentration
	- and hematocrit >44% 	
	-  if severe 
- prerenal azotemia with BUN >22 mg/dL
	- due to plasma loss in retroperitoneum and peritoneal 
	- risk of mortality higher 
- Hyperglycemia 
	- common 
	- decreased insulin, increased glucagon and increased adrenal glucocorticoid and catecholamines 
- Hypocalcemia 
	- 25% 
	- maybe due to impaired response of PTH gland 
	- intraperitoneal saponification of calcium by fatty acids in fat necrosis  
- Hyperbilirubinemia 
	- >4
	- 10% 
	- transient 
	- normal in 4-7 days 
- Elevate transaminase 
	- parallel bilirubin 
	- sign of gallstones if ALT >3x normal 
- Hypoxemia (pO2 <60mmHg)
	- 10-20% 
	- heralds ARDS 
- ECG -- ST and T abnormalities like MI 
- CT findings 
	- Revised Atlanta Criteria 
		- Interstitial Pancreatitis 
		- Necrotising Pancreatitis 
		- Acute pancreatic fluid collection 
		- Pancreatic pseudocyst 
		- Acute necrotic Collection (ANC) 
		- walled-off necrosis  (NOC) 
		- ![[atlantapancreas.png]]
# Diagnosis 
- any back or abdominal pain 
- 2 out of 3 
	- typical epigastric pain radiating to back 
	- 3x rise in amylase and/or lipase 
	- findings of pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging 
- Differential 
	- perforation  (especially peptic ulcer)
	- acute cholecystitis and biliary colic 
	- acute intestinal obstrucion 
	- mesenteric vascular occlusion 
	- renal colic 
	- inferior MI 
	- dissecting aortic aneurysm 
	- CTD with vasculitis 
	- pneumonia 
	- DKA 
# Clinical course, definition , classification 
- According to Revised Atlanta Criteria 
- Phases of Acute pancreatitis 
	- Early (<2 weeks)
		- 1-2 weeks 
		- severity is clinical not morphology 
		- SIRS +, if persistent predisposes to organ damage 
		- Assess respiratory , renal and CVS for organ damage 
		- Organ Failure is Marshall score >2 for one of 3 organ systems 
		- persistent >48h organ failure is severe pancreatitis 
		- CT not advised for first 48h 
	- Late phase (>2 weeks)
		- protracted course 
		- require imaging 
		- organ failure is critical marker 
		- Supportive measures like dialysis, ventilation , supplemental nutrition from NJ or parenteral route 
		- Necrotising pancreatitis on CT is important 
			- prolonged hospitalization 
			- if infected , surgery 
- Severity 
	- Mild 
		- without local complication or failure 
		- in most interstitial pancreatitis 
		- mild acute is self-limited and subsides in 3-7 day s
		- Oral if 
			- hunger 
			- normal bowel function 
			- no nausea or vomiting 
			- liquid (full or clear ) diet 
			- low-fat solid diet post recovery 
	- Moderate 
		- transient organ failure (<48h) or
		- local or systemic complication in absence of persistent organ failure 
		- necrosis +/- 
		- mortality low 
	- Severe 
		- persistent organ failure (>48h) of one or more organs 
		- CT or MRI for necrosis or complication 
		- prophylactic antibiotics no longer recommended
- Imaging 
	- Interstitial ir necrotising based on perfusion 
	- CT with IV contrast 3-5 days after hospitalization if patient not responding to conservative management 
	- overused in 1st 72h in mild severity 
	- Interstitial 
		- 90-95% 
		- diffuse gland enlargement , homogenous contrast enhancement and mild inflammatory changes or peripancreatic stranding 
	- Necrotising 
		- 5-10 
		- evolves over several days 
		- lack of parenchymal enhancement 
		- findings of peripancreatic necrosis +/- 
		- variable course 
			- remain solid or liquefy,
			- remain sterile or become infected, and 
			- persist or disappear over time
		- ***Peripancreatic necrosis only has better prognosis than pancreatic necrosis*** 
# Management of Acute Pancreatitis 
- 85-90 self-limited and resolve in 3-7 days 
- In emergency ward
	- After diagnosis , early and aggressive fluid resuscitation
		- if non responding , admit to ICU for aggressive management , monitor and organ failure management 
	- IV analgesia 
	- Assess Severity 
	- Etiology 
- Fluid Resuscitation 
	- early aggressive 
	- prevents systemic complication from SIRS 
	- initially NPO to reduce nutrient induced pancreatic stimulation 
	- IV analgesia to control abdominal pain 
	- supplemental O2 
	- IV NS or RL at 15-20mL/kg (1000-1400mL) bolus followed by 2-3mL/kg/hour (200-250ml/hour)
	- serial bedside evaluation at 6-8h to assess vitals 
	- RL reduces systemic inflammation  (lower CRP) and better than NS 
	- Targeted Resuscitation Strategy 
		- measure hematocrit and BUN every 8-12h 
		- less aggressive in milder pancreatitis 
		- Rising BUN in hospital 
			- has higher mortality 
			- repeated volume challenge with 2L crystalloid 
			- increase fluid rate by 1.5ml/kg/hour 
		- Fall in hematocrit and BUN in 12-24h is sign of adequate fluids 
- Assessment of Severity 
	- BISAP (Bedside Index of Severity in Acute Pancreatitis) 
		- in first 24h 
		- BUN >25mg/dl 
		- GCS <15 
		- SIRS 
		- age >60 
		- Pleural effusion on radiography 
		- 3 or more have higher mortality 
	- hematocrit >44 or BUN >22 at admission have more severe acute pancreatitis 
	- If SIRS absent in 1st 24h, unlikely to develop necrosis or organ failure 
- Special Consideration 
	- History , medication , labs (LFT, TGs, calcium ), USG for gallbladder 
	- Gallstone Pancreatitis 
		- if ascending cholangitis (Rising WBCs, LFTs) do ERCP in 24-48h 
		- Higher risks of recurrent 
		- perform cholecystectomy in same admission if mild acute 
		- if not surgical candidate, do endoscopic biliary sphincterotomy 
	- Hypertriglyceridemia 
		- >1000 associated with acute pancreatitis 
		- IV insulin for hyperglycemia corrects hypertriglyceridemia 
		- Heparin or plasmapheresis have +/- evidence 
		- OPD 
			- control diabetes 
			- lipid lowering agents 
			- weight loss drugs 
- Nutrition 
	- low-fat solid diet 
	- 2-3 days after admission in acute severe pancreatitis 
	- Enteral 
		- gut barrier integrity maintained 
		- limits bacterial translocation 
		- less expensive 
		- less complication 
- Management of local complication 
	- Include 
		- necrosis 
		- pseudocyst 
		- Duct disruption 
		- peripancreatic vascular complication 
		- extrapancreatic infections 
	- Necrosis 
		- multidisciplinary team 
		- Percutaneous fine needle aspiration +/- depends on institutional preference 
		- No role of prophylactic antibiotics 
		- Empirical therapy if clinical decompensated 
		- Repeat CT or MRI for complication 
		- Sterile necrosis managed conservative 
		- Infected necrosis
			- give targeted antibiotics 
			- drainage and/or debridement 
			- 2/3 respond to antibiotics only 
		- Step-up approach 
			- percutaneous or endoscopic transgastric/transduodenal drainage followed, if necessary, by surgical necrosectomy 
		- more conservative approach better with close supervision 
		- conservative if successful continue for 4-6 weeks till more definite outcome either as resolution or organisation into walled-off 
	- Pseudocyst 
		- low incidence and most resolve spontaneous 
		- <10% have collections after 4 weeks 
		- symptomatic require endoscopic or surgical drainage 
	- Pancreatic Duct Disruption 
		-

# Hematopoietic Stem Cells: Overview

- **Definition**: All cell types in the peripheral blood and some cells in every tissue are derived from hematopoietic (hemo: blood; poiesis: creation) stem cells.
- **Survival Impact**: If hematopoietic stem cells are damaged and cannot function (e.g., due to a nuclear accident), a person would survive **2–4 weeks** without extraordinary support measures.
- **Clinical Significance**: Tens of thousands of lives are saved each year with the clinical use of hematopoietic stem cells.
- **Production Capacity**: These stem cells produce **hundreds of billions of blood cells daily** from an estimated pool of only 100,000 cells.
- **Research Paradigm**: The study of blood cell production serves as a **paradigm** for understanding how other tissues are organized and regulated.
    - **Basic Research Focuses**: Defining stepwise molecular changes in maturing cells, aggregating cells into functional subgroups, and demonstrating hematopoietic stem cell regulation by a specialized microenvironment.
    - **Broad Applicability**: These concepts may apply to both normal tissue function and malignancy.
- **Research Challenges**:
    - Stem cells are **rare** among heterogeneous cell types.
    - Their behavior is assessed mainly in **experimental animal models** involving hematopoiesis reconstitution.
    - Much knowledge is **imprecise** and based on inferences from genetically manipulated animals.

# Cardinal Functions of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

- **Two Essential Features**: All stem cell types possess **self-renewal** and **differentiation** capacities.
- **Purpose**: Stem cells exist to **generate, maintain, and repair tissues**.
- **Functional Success**: Achieved if stem cells can replace a wide variety of shorter-lived mature cells over prolonged periods.
- **Self-Renewal Process**: Assures the **sustenance of a stem cell population over time**. Without it, the stem cell pool would be exhausted, preventing tissue maintenance.
- **Differentiation Process**: Leads to the **production of mature cells**, which are the effectors of tissue function. Without proper differentiation, tissue function integrity would be compromised, potentially leading to organ failure or neoplasia.
- **Molecular Factors Associated with Stem Cells**:
- |Category | Factors/Molecules | Source | | :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | | Intrinsic (Self-renewal) | Bmi-1, Gfi-1, PTEN, STAT5, Tel/Atv6, p21, p18, MCL-1, Mel-18, RAE28, HoxB4 | | | Extrinsic (Self-renewal) | Notch, Wnt, SHH, angiogenin, Tie2/Ang-1 | | | Cell Surface (Murine) | CD34, Thy-1 (CD90), c-Kit receptor (CD117), CD133, CD164, c-Mpl (CD110, thrombopoietin receptor) | |
- **Mature Blood Cell Life Spans**:
    - Mature neutrophils: Hours.
    - Red blood cells: A few months.
    - Memory lymphocytes: Many years.
- **Stem Cell Pool Durability**: Serves as the central, durable source of all blood and immune cells, maintaining broad cell production capacity from a single source for decades.
- **Stem Cell Division Outcomes**: An individual stem cell can accomplish one of three division outcomes:
    - **Two stem cells** (symmetric cell division).
    - **Two cells destined for differentiation** (symmetric cell division).
    - **One stem cell and one differentiating cell** (asymmetric cell division).
    - The balance of these outcomes can change during development and under specific demands on the stem cell pool.

# Developmental Biology of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

- **Changing Production Sites**: During development, blood cells are produced at different sites sequentially.
    - **Initial Site (Yolk Sac)**: Provides oxygen-carrying red blood cells and many tissue-resident macrophage-like cells (e.g., microglia in the brain). Yolk sac red cells express embryonic hemoglobins.
    - **Subsequent Sites**: Placenta and several intraembryonic sites become involved.
        - **Intraembryonic sites** (e.g., genital ridge where aorta, gonadal tissue, mesonephros emerge): Generate stem cells, red cells, platelets, and circulating cells of innate immunity.
    - **Later Sites**: Fetal liver, then in the second trimester, the **bone marrow and spleen**.
        - Production of adaptive immunity cells occurs, becoming robust as the thymus forms and bone marrow is colonized in the second trimester.
- **Stem Cell Proliferation Post-Birth**: Proliferation remains high in the bone marrow until shortly after birth, then appears to decline dramatically.
- **Bone Marrow Colonization**: Cells in the bone marrow are thought to arrive via bloodborne transit from the fetal liver after calcification of the long bones begins.
- **Circulating Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs)**:
    - HSCs **circulate throughout life**.
    - **Circulation Time**: Appears to be brief (minutes in mice).
    - **Functionality**: Circulating HSCs are functional and can be used for transplantation.
    - **Mobilization**: The number of circulating stem cells can be increased to facilitate harvest and transfer.

# Mobility of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

- **Entry/Exit from Bone Marrow**: Cells move through a series of molecular interactions.
- **Molecular Interactions for Engraftment**:
    - **Rolling Phenotype**: Circulating stem cells (via CD162 and CD44) engage P- and E-selectin on the endothelial surface to slow movement.
    - **Firm Adhesion**: Stem cell integrins activate, achieving firm adhesion between the stem cell and vessel wall. **Stem cell VCAM-1 engaging endothelial VLA-4** plays a particularly important role.
    - **Transmigration to Bone Marrow**:
        - The chemokine **CXCL12 (SDF1)** interacting with stem cell **CXCR4 receptors**.
        - **Ionic calcium** interacting with the **calcium-sensing receptor**.
        - These interactions are particularly important for the developmental move from fetal liver to bone marrow.
- **CXCR4 Role in Adults**: Important for **retention** of stem cells in the bone marrow as well as their initial homing there.
- **Mobilization for Therapeutic Use**:
    - **Mechanism**: Interrupting stem cell retention by:
        - Specific molecular blockers of the CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction.
        - Cleavage of CXCL12.
        - Downregulation of the CXCR4 receptor.
    - **Outcome**: Leads to the release of stem cells into the circulation.
    - **Clinical Benefit**: This process is crucial for recovering stem cells, permitting **harvesting by leukapheresis**instead of surgical bone marrow punctures.
    - **Clinical Mobilizing Agents**:
        - **Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor**.
        - **Plerixafor** (a macrocyclic compound that blocks CXCR4).
- **Future Implications**: Refining knowledge of how stem cells enter and exit the bone marrow may improve acquisition of stem cells and their efficiency in finding specific blood cell production sites (the stem cell niche).

# Hematopoietic Stem Cell Microenvironment

- **Concept (Stem Cell Niche)**:
    - First proposed to explain why cells from a donor's bone marrow could be transplanted and found again in the recipient's bone marrow.
    - More than just a housing site; it is an **anatomic location providing regulatory signals**.
- **Niche Functions**:
    - Allows stem cells to **thrive** and **expand if needed**.
    - Enables stem cells to provide varying amounts of descendant daughter cells.
    - **Regulates the number of stem cells produced** to prevent problematic unregulated growth.
    - Acts as both a **nutritive and constraining home**.
- **Location in Humans**:
    - Changes with each blood production site during development.
    - For most of human life, it is in the **bone marrow**.
    - Specifically within the bone marrow, the **perivascular space**, particularly in regions of trabecular bone, serves as a niche.
- **Niche Cell Types and Factors**: | Cell Type/Component | Role/Produced Factor | Source | | :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- | | Mesenchymal cells | Produce **kit ligand** and **CXCL12** (both important for HSCs) | | | Endothelial cells | Produce **kit ligand** and **CXCL12** (both important for HSCs) | | | Sympathetic neurons | Regulate stem cells (some by direct, others by indirect effects) | | | Nonmyelinating Schwann cells | Regulate stem cells (some by direct, others by indirect effects) | | | Macrophages | Regulate stem cells (some by direct, others by indirect effects) | | | Megakaryocytes | Regulate stem cells (some by direct, others by indirect effects) | | | Osteoclasts | Regulate stem cells (some by direct, others by indirect effects) | | | Osteoblasts | Regulate stem cells (some by direct, others by indirect effects) | | | Extracellular matrix proteins | Affect stem cell function (e.g., **osteopontin** and **heparan sulfates**) | |
- **Importance of Endosteal Region for Transplantation**: Appears particularly important for transplanted cells. This is partly because conditioning regimens for transplantation disrupt many mesenchymal cells and sinusoidal blood vessels of the central marrow.
- **Clinical and Research Significance**:
    - The niche's function as a supportive context for stem cells is critical for maintaining hematopoiesis and in transplantation.
    - An active area of study explores whether the niche is altered in disease, as experimental models show niche cell mutations can lead to myeloid malignancies.
    - **Targeting niche functions** is a potential therapeutic strategy for both malignant and normal hematopoiesis.

# Excess Capacity of Hematopoietic Stem Cells

- **Abundance**: In the absence of disease, an individual **never runs out of hematopoietic stem cells**.
    - **Evidence**: Serial transplantation studies in mice suggest enough stem cells are present to reconstitute several animals successively with normal blood cell production. Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients also never run out of blood cells over their lifespan (which can extend for decades), indicating even limited numbers of provided stem cells are sufficient.
- **Response to Conditions**: How stem cells increase or decrease mature cell production in response to different conditions remains poorly understood.
- **Distinct Regulatory Mechanisms**:
    - Many regulatory mechanisms that govern production of more mature progenitor cells do not apply, or apply differently, to stem cells.
    - Molecules shown to change the size of the stem cell pool have little effect on more mature blood cells.
        - **Examples**:
            - The growth factor **erythropoietin**, which stimulates red blood cell production from precursor cells, has **no effect on stem cells**.
            - **Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor** drives rapid proliferation of granulocyte precursors but has **little or no effect on the cell cycling of stem cells**. Instead, it indirectly changes stem cell location by altering molecules like CXCL12 that tether stem cells to their niche.
    - Molecules important for altering the proliferation, self-renewal, or survival of stem cells (e.g., cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, transcription factors like Bmi-1, microRNA-processing enzymes like Dicer, or metabolic regulators like pyruvate kinase isoforms) have little or different effects on progenitor cells.
- **Conclusion**: Hematopoietic stem cells have **governing mechanisms that are distinct** from the cells they generate.

# Hematopoietic Stem Cell Differentiation

- **Hierarchy**: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are at the **base of a branching hierarchy** that culminates in the many mature cell types forming the blood and immune system.
- **Maturation Process**: Steps leading to terminally differentiated, functional blood cells occur due to intrinsic gene expression changes, and niche-directed and cytokine-directed changes. Detailed knowledge is incomplete.
- **Functional Changes during Maturation**: As HSCs mature to progenitors, precursors, and finally, mature effector cells, they undergo a series of functional changes:
    - **Acquisition of Mature Functions**: E.g., phagocytic capacity, hemoglobin synthesis.
    - **Progressive Loss of Plasticity**: The ability to become other cell types decreases.
        - Example: A myeloid progenitor can make all cells in the myeloid series but none in the lymphoid series.
        - Common myeloid progenitors mature into precursors for either monocytes/granulocytes OR erythrocytes/megakaryocytes, but not both.
- **Reversibility**: Some reversibility may exist early in the differentiation cascade but is lost beyond a distinct stage in normal physiological conditions. However, with genetic interventions, blood cells (like other somatic cells) can be reprogrammed to become various cell types.
- **Proliferative Capacity (Fig. 96-3)**:
    - As cells differentiate, they may lose proliferative capacity.
    - **Mature granulocytes**: Incapable of proliferation; only increase in number via increased production from precursors.
    - **Exceptions (Capable of Proliferation)**: Some tissue-resident macrophages and lymphoid cells. Lymphoid cells link proliferation to antigen receptor recognition.
    - **Blood Cell Proliferation**: Largely accomplished by a more immature progenitor population (similar to skin and intestine).
    - **Progenitor Cells**: Generally short-lived and highly proliferative (also known as transient amplifying cells).
    - **Differentiation Speed**: The differentiation program is difficult to speed up.
    - **Timeframe**: It takes **~10–14 days** for hematopoietic progenitors to become mature cells in humans, clinically evident as the interval between cytotoxic chemotherapy and blood count recovery.
- **Differentiation Potential of Individual HSCs**:
    - Individual stem cells may **not be equal** in their differentiation potential.
    - Some stem cells are **"biased"** to become specific mature cell types.
    - The concept of a binary choice (lymphoid or myeloid differentiation) is not entirely accurate.
    - New commitment steps include cell populations with limited megakaryocytic/erythroid or myeloid (monocyte/granulocyte)/lymphoid potential.

# Self-Renewal

- **Balance of Fates**: The hematopoietic stem cell must balance its three potential fates: **apoptosis, self-renewal, and differentiation**.
- **Proliferation and Self-Renewal**:
    - Generally, cell proliferation is not associated with the ability to undergo a self-renewing division, except for memory T and B cells and stem cells.
    - Emerging data suggest some myeloid committed progenitors may also have self-renewing potential _in vivo_, providing long-term cell production.
    - All stem cells, by definition, have self-renewing capacity and distinct proliferation machinery.
- **HSC Quiescence**:
    - HSCs in many adult tissues are **heterogeneous**: some are deeply quiescent (serving as a deep reserve), while others are more proliferative (replenishing the short-lived progenitor population).
    - HSCs are generally **cytokine-resistant**, remaining dormant even when cytokines induce rapid proliferation in bone marrow progenitors.
    - HSCs are thought to divide at much longer intervals, measured in months to years, for the most quiescent cells.
    - **Challenge**: This quiescence is difficult to overcome _in vitro_, limiting the ability to effectively expand human hematopoietic stem cells.
    - **Control of Quiescence**:
        - **Intrinsic Factors**: Particularly high levels of **cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors** like **p57 or CDKN1c**, which restrict entry into the cell cycle by blocking the G1-S transition.
        - **Exogenous Niche Signals**: Include angiogenin, interleukin 18, and potentially angiopoietin 1.
- **Age-Related Changes in HSC Regulation**:
    - **Implicated Factors**: Cell-intrinsic features like the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor **p16INK4a** and bone marrow microenvironment features like declining sympathetic innervation.
    - **Intervention Effects**: Lowering p16INK4a expression or stimulating beta-3 adrenergic receptors in older animals improves stem cell cycling and reconstitution capacity, making them similar to younger animals. Mature cell numbers are unaffected.
    - **Future Potential**: Understanding these molecular events offers potential for new therapeutic approaches to changing stem cell functions.
    - **Area for Study**: The molecular regulation of self-renewal remains poorly defined.
- **Clinical Importance for Medicine**:
    - **Self-renewal** is arguably the **most important function of stem cells for medicine** as it is critical in regulating stem cell number.
    - **Stem cell number** is a **key limiting parameter** for both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
    - **Benefits of controlling self-renewal (e.g., using fewer cells or expanding limited numbers ex vivo)**:
        - Reduce morbidity and expense of stem cell harvests.
        - Enable use of other stem cell sources.
        - Improve potential for gene-modified stem cell transplant.
    - **Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB)**: A rich source of stem cells, but generally has an **inadequate number of cells for adult transplantation**.
        - **Advantages**: Lower incidence of graft-versus-host disease, cord blood banks represent populations underrepresented in adult donor registries.
        - **Disadvantage**: Hematopoietic reconstitution from UCB is slow, partly due to cell number.
        - **Potential Improvement**: Expansion might improve UCB use.
        - **Current Trend**: Advances in haploidentical donor cell transplantation have reduced cord blood use.
- **Gene-Modified Stem Cells**:
    - Increasingly tested and show **great promise for genetic blood diseases** (e.g., congenital immunodeficiencies, hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease).
    - **Problem**: Complexity and cost of modifying enough stem cells for transplantation.
    - **Solution**: Expanding a small number of gene-modified stem cells may mitigate this issue.
    - **Conclusion**: Understanding self-renewal facilitates development of an important new area of stem cell-based medicine.
- **Molecular Regulation of Self-Renewal (Limited Understanding)**:
    - Intriguingly implicates gene products associated with the **chromatin state** (high-order organization of chromosomal DNA influencing transcription).
    - **Key Molecular Regulators**:
        - **Polycomb family members**: Zinc finger-containing transcriptional regulators that interact with chromatin structure, contributing to gene accessibility for transcription.
            - **Bmi-1**: Important for enabling hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal through modification of cell cycle regulators (e.g., cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors).
                - Absence of Bmi-1 or Gfi-1: Hematopoietic stem cells decline in number and function.
                - Dysregulation/overexpression of Bmi-1: Associated with leukemia; may promote leukemic stem cell self-renewal.
            - **Asxl1**: A polycomb gene commonly mutated in myelodysplasia and leukemia.
        - **Homeobox ("hox") genes**: Transcription factors governing large numbers of genes.
            - **HoxB4**: Capable of inducing extensive self-renewal of stem cells through its DNA-binding motif.
            - Other hox family members affect normal stem cells and are associated with leukemia.
        - **Epigenetic modifiers**:
            - **DNA methyl transferase DNMT3a**.
            - **Dioxygenase Tet2** (involved in DNA demethylation).
            - **Mutations** in DNMT3a, Tet2 (and Asxl1): Associated with clonal outgrowth of stem cells bearing the mutations. These mutations are **not sufficient for malignancy** but enable clones to gain dominance and predispose cells to malignant transformation. They are often referred to as **"founder mutations"** because myelodysplastic and leukemic cells appear to evolve from them.

# Cancer is Similar to an Organ with Self-Renewing Capacity

- **Relationship to Cancer**: An important dimension of adult stem cell biology.
- **Cancer Organization**: May share organizational principles with normal tissues.
- **Cancer Cell Heterogeneity**: Even within a given patient, cancer cells are heterogeneous and may have a **hierarchical organization** with a base of stem-like cells.
- **Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs)**:
    - Possess the signature stem cell features: **self-renewal and differentiation**.
    - Might be the basis for **perpetuation of the tumor**.
    - Represent a **slowly dividing, rare population** with distinct regulatory mechanisms, including a relationship with a specialized microenvironment.
    - Defined for some, but **not all, cancers** (e.g., myeloid leukemias where founder mutations enable clones to expand).
    - With additional mutations, these cells can serve as the **initiating or stem cells of a cancer**.
    - **Clinical Significance**: Eliminating these cells may be **necessary for curing the patient**.
    - **Active Investigation**: Understanding hierarchical cell organization within cancers and whether eliminating cancer stem cell equivalents improves cure rates.
- **Cellular Origin of Cancer**:
    - The fact that some cancer cells have stem cell-like properties does **not necessarily mean the cancer arose in the stem cell itself**.
    - More mature cells could acquire the self-renewal characteristics of stem cells.
    - **Cancer is a multistep process**: A single genetic event is unlikely to be sufficient for full transformation.
    - **Requirement for Accumulation of Mutations**: The cell of origin must be able to **persist for prolonged periods** and **generate large numbers of daughter cells**.
    - **Normal Stem Cell Susceptibility**: Normal stem cells have these properties (intrinsic self-renewal) and therefore may be more readily converted to a malignant phenotype.
    - **Experimental Evidence (Hematopoietic System)**:
        - Experiments using cell-surface markers to isolate HSCs, progenitors, precursors, and mature cells.
        - Transforming gene constructs placed in these cells.
        - Finding: The cell with the **greatest potential to produce malignancy was dependent on the transforming gene**. In some cases, it was the stem cell; in others, the progenitor cell initiated and perpetuated the cancer.
    - **Conclusion**: This demonstrates that cells can **acquire stem cell-like properties in malignancy**.

# What Else Can Hematopoietic Stem Cells Do?

- **Potential in Non-Hematopoietic Healing**:
    - Some experimental data suggest HSCs or other bone marrow cells may play a role in **healing vascular and tissue damage** associated with stroke and myocardial infarction.
    - These data are **controversial**, and the applicability of a stem cell approach to non-hematopoietic conditions remains **experimental**.
- **Reprogramming Technology**: Offers potential to use readily obtained hematopoietic cells as a source for cells with other capabilities.
    - **Active Areas of Investigation**:
        - Using reprogrammed cells to generate **mature lymphoid cells for immuno-oncology applications**.
        - Using reprogrammed cells to generate **red cells and platelets** to overcome dependency on blood donors.

# Stem Cells as Targets of Gene Therapy

- **Feasibility**: Tools to alter gene sequence, expression, and regulation are becoming increasingly feasible.
- **Targeting HSCs**: The hematopoietic stem cell is a target for a wide range of interventions.
- **Gene Therapy Approaches and Applications**:
    - **Vector-based gene replacement**: Lentiviral, retroviral, and adenoviral vectors are used to **replace defective genes** (e.g., in primary immunodeficiency diseases).
    - **Antisense technology**: Applied to **block gene expression** (e.g., blocking Bcl11a repression of fetal globin expression in sickle cell disease and thalassemia).
    - **CRISPR/Cas technology**: Applied to **repair abnormal gene sequences**.
- **Significance**: Precision genetic manipulations are expanding, with the hematopoietic system being central to this advancement.

# Summary

- The stem cell possesses **tremendous healing capacity** and is **essential for life**.
- However, if **dysregulated**, it can threaten the life it maintains.
- **Critical for developing effective stem cell-based medicines**: Understanding how stem cells function, the signals that modify their behavior, and the tissue niches that modulate their responses to injury and disease.

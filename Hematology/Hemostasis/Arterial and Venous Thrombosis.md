# OVERVIEW OF THROMBOSIS

## GENERAL OVERVIEW

- **Thrombosis** is the **obstruction of blood flow due to the formation of clot**.
- It may result in **tissue anoxia and damage** 
- In the nondiseased state, **physiologic hemostasis** reflects a delicate interplay between factors that promote and inhibit blood clotting, favoring the former. This response prevents uncontrolled hemorrhage.
- The same processes regulating normal hemostasis can cause **pathologic thrombosis**, leading to arterial or venous occlusion.
- Many commonly used therapeutic interventions may adversely alter the thrombotic–hemostatic balance.
- **Hemostasis and thrombosis primarily involve the interplay among three factors**:
    - **The vessel wall**
    - **Coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins**
    - **Platelets**
- Many prevalent acute vascular diseases are due to thrombus formation within a vessel, including **myocardial infarction, thrombotic cerebrovascular events, and venous thrombosis**.
- Although the end result is **vessel occlusion and tissue ischemia**, the pathophysiologic processes governing these pathologies have similarities as well as distinct differences.
- Pathways regulating thrombus formation are similar to those regulating hemostasis, but the **processes triggering or perpetuating thrombosis may be distinct** and can vary in different clinical and genetic settings.
- In **venous thrombosis**, primary hypercoagulable states (defects in proteins governing coagulation and/or fibrinolysis) or secondary hypercoagulable states (abnormalities of blood vessels and blood flow or stasis) lead to thrombosis.
- By contrast, **arterial thrombosis is highly dependent on**:
    - **The state of the vessel wall**
    - **The platelet**
    - **Factors related to blood flow**

# ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS

## OVERVIEW OF ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS

- In arterial thrombosis, **platelets and abnormalities of the vessel wall typically play a key role in vessel occlusion**.
- Arterial thrombus forms via a series of sequential steps:
    - **Platelets adhere to the vessel wall**
    - **Additional platelets are recruited**
    - **Thrombin is activated**
- While the primary function of platelets is hemostasis, their role in other processes such as **immunity, metastasis, wound healing, and inflammation** continues to evolve.

## ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR DISEASE

- Arterial thrombosis is a **major cause of morbidity and mortality** both in the United States and worldwide 
## THE PLATELET

- Many processes in platelets have parallels with other cell types (e.g., specific receptors, signaling pathways).
- Unlike most cells, **platelets lack a nucleus** and are unable to adapt to changing biologic settings by altered gene transcription.
- Platelets sustain limited protein synthetic capacity from megakaryocyte-derived messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA).
- Most molecules needed to respond to stimuli are maintained in **storage granules and membrane compartments**.
- Platelets are **disc-shaped, very small (1–5 μm in diameter), anucleate cells**.
- They circulate in the blood at concentrations of **200–400,000/μL**, with an average life span of **7–10 days**.
- Platelets are derived from **megakaryocytes**, polyploidal hematopoietic cells found in the bone marrow.
- The primary regulator of platelet formation is **thrombopoietin (TPO)**.
- The process of platelet production likely involves formation of **proplatelets**, pseudopod-like structures from which platelets bud.
- After release into the circulation, young, large platelets may continue to divide.
- Platelet granules are synthesized in megakaryocytes before thrombopoiesis and contain an array of **prothrombotic, proinflammatory, and antimicrobial mediators**.
- The two major types of platelet granules, alpha and dense, are distinguished by their size, abundance, and content.

|Granule Type|Characteristics|Contents|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Alpha**|Larger and more abundant. Contains proteins that may be more important in the inflammatory response.|**Soluble coagulation proteins, adhesion molecules, growth factors, integrins, cytokines, and inflammatory modulators**.|
|**Dense**|Smaller and less abundant.|**High concentrations of small molecules**, including **adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and serotonin**, which influence platelet aggregation and vasomotor tone.|

### Platelet Adhesion

- The formation of a thrombus is initiated by the **adherence of platelets to the damaged vessel wall**.
- Damage exposes **subendothelial components** responsible for triggering platelet reactivity:
    - **Collagen**
    - **Von Willebrand factor**
    - **Fibronectin**
    - Other adhesive proteins (e.g., vitronectin, thrombospondin)
- The hemostatic response may vary depending on the extent of damage, specific proteins exposed, and flow conditions.
- Certain proteins expressed on the platelet surface regulate collagen-induced platelet adhesion, particularly under flow conditions:
    - **Glycoprotein (GP) IV**
    - **GPVI**
    - **Integrin α2β1**
- The **platelet GPIb-IX-V complex adhesive receptor is central to both platelet adhesion and the initiation of platelet activation**.
- The GPIb-IX-V complex binds to the exposed von Willebrand factor, causing platelets to adhere.
- Engagement of the GPIb-IX-V complex with its ligand induces **signaling pathways that lead to platelet activation**.
- Von Willebrand factor–bound GPIb-IX-V promotes a **calcium-dependent conformational change in the GPIIb/IIIa receptor**, transforming it from an inactive low-affinity state to an active **high-affinity receptor for fibrinogen**.

### Platelet Activation

- The activation of platelets is controlled by a variety of **surface receptors** that regulate various functions.
- Platelet receptors are stimulated by a wide variety of agonists and adhesive proteins, resulting in variable degrees of activation.
- Stimulation of platelet receptors generally triggers two processes:
    1. **Activation of internal signaling pathways** that lead to further platelet activation and granule release.
    2. The **capacity of the platelet to bind to other adhesive proteins/platelets**.
- Both processes contribute to the formation of a thrombus.
- Stimulation of nonthrombotic receptors results in platelet adhesion or interaction with other vascular cells, including endothelial cells, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells.
- **Receptor families found on platelets**:
    - **Seven transmembrane receptor family**: Main agonist-stimulated receptor family.
        - Includes **ADP receptors, prostaglandin receptors, lipid receptors, and chemokine receptors**.
        - **Receptors for thrombin** comprise the major seven transmembrane receptors.
        - The first identified thrombin receptor was **protease activation receptor 1 (PAR1)**.
        - PAR class receptors activate by **specific cleavage of the N-terminus by thrombin**, which then acts as a ligand.
        - Other PAR receptors on platelets include PAR2 (not activated by thrombin) and PAR4.
    - **Adenosine receptors**: Responsible for transduction of **ADP-induced signaling events**.
        - Initiated by binding of ADP to purinergic receptors on the platelet surface.
        - Distinct ADP receptors: **P2X1, P2Y1, and P2Y12**.
        - **Activation of both P2Y12 and P2Y1 receptors is essential for ADP-induced platelet aggregation**.
        - **Thienopyridine derivatives, clopidogrel and prasugrel, are clinically used inhibitors of ADP-induced platelet aggregation**.

### Platelet Aggregation

- Activation of platelets results in a rapid series of signal transduction events, including **tyrosine kinase, serine/threonine kinase, and lipid kinase activation**.
- In unstimulated platelets, the major platelet integrin **GPIIb/IIIa is maintained in an inactive conformation** and functions as a low-affinity adhesion receptor for fibrinogen.
- This integrin is unique as it is **only expressed on platelets**.
- After stimulation, the **interaction between fibrinogen and GPIIb/IIIa forms intercellular connections between platelets**, leading to the formation of a platelet aggregate.
- A **calcium-sensitive conformational change in the extracellular domain of GPIIb/IIIa** enables the high-affinity binding of soluble plasma fibrinogen as a result of complex inside-out signaling events.
- The GPIIb/IIIa receptor serves as a **bidirectional conduit**.
- **GPIIb/IIIa-mediated signaling (outside-in)** occurs immediately after fibrinogen binding.
- This leads to additional intracellular signaling that **further stabilizes the platelet aggregate** and transforms platelet aggregation from a reversible to an **irreversible process (inside-out)**.

## THE ROLE OF PLATELETS AND THROMBOSIS IN INFLAMMATION

- **Inflammation plays an important role during the acute thrombotic phase** of acute coronary and other vascular occlusive syndromes.
- People with acute upper respiratory infections are at **higher risk of myocardial infarction and thrombotic stroke**.
- Patients with acute coronary syndromes have increased **homotypic (platelet-platelet) aggregates** and increased **heterotypic (platelet-leukocyte) aggregates**.
- Heterotypic aggregates form when platelets are activated (often directly by pathogens) and adhere to circulating leukocytes as part of their contribution to the immune process.
- Platelets bind via **P-selectin (CD62P)** (expressed on activated platelets) to the leukocyte receptor, **P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1)**.
- This association leads to increased expression of **CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1)** on leukocytes, which amplifies immunity and may support further interactions with platelets.
- Platelet surface P-selectin also induces the expression of **tissue factor on monocytes**, which promotes fibrin formation.
- The immunomodulator, **soluble CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154)**, reflects a link between thrombosis and inflammation.
- The CD40 ligand, a trimeric transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor family, along with its receptor CD40, is an important contributor to the inflammatory process leading to **thrombosis and atherosclerosis**.
- In platelets, **CD40 ligand is rapidly translocated to the surface after stimulation** and is upregulated in the newly formed thrombus.
- The surface-expressed CD40 ligand is cleaved from the platelet to generate a **soluble fragment (soluble CD40 ligand)**.
- Links have been established among **platelets, infection, immunity, and inflammation**.
- **Bacterial and viral infections** are associated with a transient increase in the risk of acute thrombotic events, such as acute myocardial infarction and stroke.
- Platelets contribute significantly to the **pathophysiology and high mortality rates of sepsis**.
- Expression, functionality, and signaling pathways of **Toll-like receptors (TLRs)** have been established in platelets.
- Stimulation of platelet **TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 directly and indirectly activates the platelet’s thrombotic and inflammatory responses**.
- Live bacteria induce a proinflammatory response in platelets in a **TLR2-dependent manner**.
- Viruses, such as **SARS-CoV-2, HIV, hepatitis C virus, and Dengue**, are known to cause elevated levels of thrombosis.
- Platelets have been shown to regulate immune responses to viruses via **TLR7 and TLR8**.

## Risk Factors for Arterial Thrombosis

- In addition to immune burden, various factors increase the risk of developing arterial thrombosis:
    - **Hypertension**
    - **High levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol**
    - **Smoking**
    - **Diabetes**
    - **Pregnancy**
    - **Age**
    - **Chemotherapeutic agents**
    - Stillbirth and loss of multiple pregnancies
    - Hormonal replacement therapy
    - **Systemic lupus erythematosus** (particularly in pediatric population)
    - **Rheumatoid arthritis**
    - **Antiphospholipid syndrome** (an autoimmune prothrombotic risk for arterial and venous thrombosis)

## GENETICS OF ARTERIAL THROMBOSIS

- Some studies have associated arterial thrombosis with genetic variants, but the associations have been **weak and not confirmed in larger series**.
- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on platelet count and mean platelet volume identified signals located in noncoding regions.
- One locus at **12q24** is a risk locus for coronary artery disease, associated with mean platelet volume and platelet count.
- Studies on genetic variability and platelet function primarily deal with **pharmacogenetics**, which addresses interindividual variability in drug response based on genetic determinants.
- This focus is driven by wide variability among individuals in response to antithrombotic drugs and the lack of a common explanation for this variance.
- The best-described issue is "**aspirin resistance**," though heterogeneity for other antithrombotics (e.g., clopidogrel) has also been extensively examined.
- Platelet-dependent genetic determinants have been defined at the level of:
    1. **Drug effect**
    2. **Drug compliance**
    3. **Drug metabolism**
- Many candidate platelet genes have been studied for their interaction with antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents.
- Many patients have an **inadequate response to the inhibitory effects of aspirin**.
    - Heritable factors contribute to the variability.
    - Ex vivo tests of residual platelet responsiveness after aspirin administration have not provided firm evidence for a pharmacogenetic interaction between aspirin and COX1 or other relevant platelet receptors.
    - **Currently, there is no clinical indication for genotyping to optimize aspirin’s antiplatelet efficiency**.
- For the platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor **clopidogrel**, additional data suggest that genetics may affect the drug’s responsiveness and utility.
    - The responsible genetic variant appears not to be the P2Y12 receptor but an **enzyme responsible for drug metabolism**.
    - Clopidogrel is a **prodrug**, and liver metabolism by specific **cytochrome P450 enzymes** is required for activation.
    - The genes encoding the CYP-dependent oxidative steps are **polymorphic**.
    - Carriers of specific alleles of the **CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 loci** have increased platelet aggregability.
    - **Increased platelet activity has been specifically associated with the CYP2C19*2 allele**, which causes loss of platelet function in select patients.
    - This observation has been shown to be clinically relevant in large studies because these are common genetic variants.
    - The **loss-of-function polymorphism in CYP2C19 is the strongest individual variable** affecting pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet response to clopidogrel, but it only accounts for 5–12% of the variability in ADP-induced platelet aggregation.
    - Genetic variables do not appear to contribute significantly to the clinical outcomes of patients treated with the P2Y12 receptor antagonists **prasugrel or ticagrelor**.

# VENOUS THROMBOSIS

## OVERVIEW OF VENOUS THROMBOSIS

- **Coagulation** is the process by which **thrombin is activated** and **soluble plasma fibrinogen is converted into insoluble fibrin**.
- These steps account for both normal hemostasis and the pathophysiologic processes influencing the development of venous thrombosis.
- The **primary forms of venous thrombosis** are:
    - **Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT)** in the extremities
    - **Subsequent embolization to the lungs (pulmonary embolism [PE])**
- DVT and PE are referred to together as **venous thromboembolic disease (VTE)**.
- Although the majority of venous thromboembolic events occur as PE or DVT of the lower extremities, up to **10% of events may occur in other vascular locations**.
- Venous thrombosis occurs due to **heritable causes** and **acquired causes**.

## DEEP-VENOUS THROMBOSIS AND PULMONARY EMBOLISM

- It is estimated that DVT or PE occurs in **∼1–2 individuals per 1000 each year**, resulting in **300,000–600,000 new cases of VTE annually** in the United States.
- Approximately **60,000–80,000 deaths are attributed to DVT or PE annually**.
- Of new cases:
    - Up to **30% of patients die within 30 days**.
    - **One-fifth suffer sudden death due to PE**.
    - **30% go on to develop recurrent VTE within 10 years**.
- Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study reported:
    - A **9% 28-day fatality rate from DVT**.
    - A **15% fatality rate from PE**.
- **PE in the setting of cancer has a 25% fatality rate**.
- The mean incidence of first DVT in the general population is **5 per 10,000 person-years**.
- The incidence is similar in males and females when adjusting for factors related to reproduction and birth control.
- Incidence increases dramatically with age:
    - From **2–3 per 10,000 person-years at 30–49 years of age**.
    - To **20 per 10,000 person-years at 70–79 years of age**.

## OVERVIEW OF THE COAGULATION CASCADE AND ITS ROLE IN VENOUS THROMBOSIS

- **Coagulation** is defined as the **formation of fibrin by a series of linked enzymatic reactions** in which each reaction product converts the subsequent inactive zymogen into an active serine protease.
- This coordinated sequence is called the **coagulation cascade** and is a key mechanism for regulating hemostasis.
- Central to the function of the coagulation cascade is the **principle of amplification**: a small stimulus can lead to much greater quantities of fibrin, the end product that prevents hemorrhage.
- Newer areas of research have identified contributions from **procoagulant microparticles, inflammatory cells, microvesicles, and fibrin structure**.
- The coagulation cascade is primarily initiated by **vascular injury exposing tissue factor to blood components**.
- Tissue factor may also be found in bloodborne cell-derived microparticles and, under pathophysiologic conditions, in leukocytes or platelets.
- **Plasma factor VII (FVII) is activated (FVIIa) by binding to tissue factor** exposed at the site of vessel damage.
- The binding of FVII/VIIa to tissue factor activates the downstream conversion of **factor X (FX) to active FX (FXa)**.
- In an alternative reaction, the FVII/FVIIa–tissue factor complex converts **FIX to FIXa**, which then activates FX in conjunction with its cofactor **factor VIII (FVIIIa)**.
- **Factor Xa with its cofactor FVa converts prothrombin to thrombin**.
- **Thrombin then converts soluble plasma fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin**, leading to clot or thrombus formation.
- **Thrombin also activates FXIII to FXIIIa**, a transglutaminase that covalently cross-links and stabilizes the fibrin clot.
- Formation of thrombi is affected by mechanisms governing fibrin structure and stability, including specific fibrinogen variants.
- **Several antithrombotic factors also regulate coagulation**:
    - **Antithrombin**
    - **Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)**
    - **Heparin cofactor II**
    - **Protein C/protein S**
- Under normal conditions, these factors limit the production of thrombin to prevent the perpetuation of coagulation and thrombus formation.
- Anticoagulant reactions governed by the normal endothelium become pivotal in limiting the extent of the hemostatically protective clot once it begins to expand toward uninjured vessel segments.

## RISK FACTORS FOR VENOUS THROMBOSIS

- An array of different factors contributes to the risk of VTE; women and men of all ages, races, and ethnicities are at risk.
- The risk factors for venous thrombosis are primarily related to **hypercoagulability** (genetic or acquired), or due to **immobilization and venous stasis**.
- **Independent predictors for recurrence** include:
    - Increasing age
    - Obesity
    - Malignant neoplasm
    - Acute extremity paresis
- It is estimated that **5–8% of the U.S. population has a genetic risk factor** known to predispose to venous thrombosis.
- Often, multiple risk factors are present in a single individual.
- **Significant risk is incurred by**:
    - Major orthopedic surgeries
    - Abdominal surgeries
    - Neurologic surgeries
- **Cancer patients** have an approximately **fourfold increased risk of VTE** compared to the general population, and cancer patients with VTE have reduced survival.
- **Hospitalized patients** have a greatly increased risk of venous thrombosis with risk factors and comorbid conditions, including:
    - Increased age, male sex, ethnicity
    - Infection
    - Renal disease
    - Weight loss
- **Community- or hospital-acquired infection** is also associated with increased risk of VTE.
- Nearly **20% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients** are noted to have coagulation abnormalities as well as increased PE, DVT, and peripheral thrombotic risk.
- **Moderate risk is promoted by**:
    - Prolonged bedrest
    - Certain types of cancer
    - Pregnancy
    - Hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptive use
    - Other sedentary conditions such as long-distance plane travel
- The risk of developing a venous thromboembolic event **doubles after air travel lasting 4 hours**, although the absolute risk remains low (1 in 6000).
- The **relative risk of VTE among pregnant or postpartum women is 4.3**, and the overall incidence is 199.7 per 100,000 woman-years.

## GENETICS OF VENOUS THROMBOSIS

- Less common causes of venous thrombosis are those due to **genetic variants**.
- These abnormalities include **loss-of-function mutations of endogenous anticoagulants** as well as **gain-of-function mutations of procoagulant proteins**.
- **Heterozygous antithrombin deficiency** and **homozygosity of the factor V Leiden mutation** significantly increase the risk of venous thrombosis.
- While homozygous protein C or protein S deficiencies are rare and may lead to fatal purpura fulminans, **heterozygous deficiencies are associated with a moderate risk of thrombosis**.
- **Activated protein C impairs coagulation by proteolytic degradation of FVa**.
- Patients resistant to the activity of activated protein C may have a **point mutation in the FV gene located on chromosome 1**, a mutant denoted **factor V Leiden**.
- Mildly increased risk has been attributed to:
    - **Elevated levels of procoagulant factors**
    - **Low levels of tissue factor pathway inhibitor**
- **Polymorphisms of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase** as well as **hyperhomocysteinemia** have been shown to be independent risk factors for venous thrombosis, as well as arterial vascular disease.
- Many initial descriptions of genetic variants and their associations with thromboembolism are being questioned in larger, more contemporary studies.

## FIBRINOLYSIS AND THROMBOSIS

- Specific abnormalities in the fibrinolytic system have been associated with **enhanced thrombosis**.
- Factors such as **elevated levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)** and **plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1)** have been associated with **decreased fibrinolytic activity** and an **increased risk of arterial thrombotic disease**.
- Specific genetic variants associated with decreased fibrinolytic activity include the **4G/5G insertion/deletion polymorphism in the PAI-1 gene**.
- Additionally, the **311-bp Alu insertion/deletion in tPA’s intron 8** has been associated with enhanced thrombosis, though genetic abnormalities have not been associated consistently with altered function or tPA levels.
- **Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI)** is a carboxypeptidase that regulates fibrinolysis.
- **Elevated plasma TAFI levels** have been associated with an increased risk of both DVT and cardiovascular disease.
- The **metabolic syndrome** is accompanied by altered fibrinolytic activity.
- This syndrome comprises **abdominal fat (central obesity), altered glucose and insulin metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension**.
- Metabolic syndrome has been associated with **atherothrombosis**.
- The mechanism for enhanced thrombosis appears to be due to both **altered platelet function** and a **procoagulant and hypofibrinolytic state**.
- An **increase in plasma levels of PAI-1** is one of the most frequently documented prothrombotic abnormalities reported in this syndrome.
- In addition to contributing to platelet function, **inflammation plays a role in both coagulation-dependent thrombus formation and thrombus resolution**.
- **Polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages** contribute to multiple overlapping thrombotic functions, including fibrinolysis, chemokine and cytokine production, and phagocytosis.

# THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ARTERIAL AND VENOUS THROMBOSIS

- Although there is overlap, **venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis are initiated differently**, and clot formation progresses by somewhat distinct pathways.

|Feature|**Venous Thrombosis**|**Arterial Thrombosis**|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Initiation**|Activated in the setting of **stasis or states of hypercoagulability**. Initiated by the **coagulation cascade** primarily due to **exposure of tissue factor**. This leads to the formation of thrombin and the subsequent conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.|Thrombin formation also occurs. Thrombosis is primarily promoted by the **adhesion of platelets to an injured vessel** and stimulated by **exposed extracellular matrix**. Platelets and abnormalities of the vessel wall typically play a key role in vessel occlusion.|
|**Hypercoagulability**|The contribution of hypercoagulable states to VTE is much better understood. Specific thrombophilic conditions, such as **factor V Leiden and the prothrombin G20210A mutation**, are risk factors for DVT, pulmonary embolism, and other venous thromboembolic events.|The contribution of hypercoagulability to arterial vascular disease is much less well understood. Many of these thrombophilic factors have **not been found to be clinically important risk factors for arterial thrombotic events**, such as acute coronary syndromes.|
|**Common Risk Factors**|Shares common risk factors with arterial thrombosis, including **age, obesity, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome**.|Shares common risk factors with venous thrombosis, including **age, obesity, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome**.|
|**Genetic Variants**|Select genetic variants, including those of the **glutathione peroxidase-3 (GPx3) gene**, have been associated with arterial and venous thrombo-occlusive disease.|Select genetic variants, including those of the **glutathione peroxidase-3 (GPx3) gene**, have been associated with arterial and venous thrombo-occlusive disease.|
|**Triggers**|Both arterial and venous thrombosis may be triggered by pathophysiologic stimuli responsible for activating **inflammatory and oxidative pathways**. Individual predisposition to arterial or venous thrombosis is an important determinant of response to vascular injury, supported by poor correlation in prothrombotic animal models between propensity to develop venous versus arterial thrombosis.|Both arterial and venous thrombosis may be triggered by pathophysiologic stimuli responsible for activating **inflammatory and oxidative pathways**.

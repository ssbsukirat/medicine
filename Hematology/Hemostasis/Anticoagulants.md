Thromboembolic disorders are significant causes of **morbidity and mortality**, originating in both arteries and veins.

- **Arterial thrombosis** is a primary cause of acute myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and limb gangrene. Most arterial thrombi occur when **atherosclerotic plaque ruptures**, exposing thrombogenic material that triggers platelet aggregation and fibrin formation, leading to a **platelet-rich thrombus** that can occlude blood flow. Due to high shear in injured arteries, arterial thrombi are **rich in platelets** and appear **white**.
- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE)** includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can result in postthrombotic syndrome, and pulmonary embolism (PE), which can be fatal or lead to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Venous thrombi rarely form at sites of obvious vascular disruption; they typically originate in the valve cusps of deep calf veins or muscular sinuses. Sluggish blood flow reduces oxygen to valve cusps, activating endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules. Tissue factor–bearing leukocytes and microvesicles adhere, inducing coagulation, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) provide a scaffold for platelets and activate factor XII. Impaired blood flow also reduces clearance of activated clotting factors, exacerbating thrombus formation. If these thrombi extend from calf veins into more proximal leg veins, fragments can dislodge and cause PE. Venous thrombi form under low shear, contain **few platelets**, and are predominantly composed of **fibrin and trapped red cells**, appearing **red** in color.

Antithrombotic drugs are used to prevent and treat thrombosis by targeting the components of thrombi. These agents are classified into **antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic agents**.

- For **arterial thrombosis**, strategies primarily focus on **antiplatelet agents**, though anticoagulants and fibrinolytic agents may be used in acute settings. Combining low-dose **rivaroxaban** (an oral factor Xa inhibitor) with dual-antiplatelet therapy reduces recurrent ischemic events and stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Its addition to aspirin also reduces the risk of major adverse coronary and limb events in patients with stable coronary or peripheral artery disease, highlighting the utility of combining low-dose anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents for secondary prevention.
- **Anticoagulants** are the mainstay for preventing and treating **venous thromboembolism** due to the predominance of fibrin in venous thrombi. Antiplatelet drugs are less effective in this context due to the limited platelet content. Fibrinolytic therapy is used in selected VTE patients, such as those with massive PE, who can benefit from systemic or catheter-directed therapy. Pharmaco-mechanical therapy is also employed to restore blood flow in patients with extensive DVT.

## ANTIPLATELET DRUGS

### Role of Platelets in Arterial Thrombosis

In healthy vasculature, platelets circulate in an inactive state, maintained by **nitric oxide (NO)** and **prostacyclin** released from endothelial cells, which also express **CD39** (an ecto-adenosine diphosphatase) that degrades ADP.

Upon **vessel wall damage**:

- Release of NO and prostacyclin is impaired, and subendothelial matrix is exposed.
- Platelets adhere to exposed **collagen** via α2β1 and glycoprotein (Gp) V1, and to **von Willebrand factor (VWF)**via Gp Ibα and Gp IIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3). These receptors are constitutively expressed.
- Adherent platelets undergo a change in shape, secrete **ADP** from their dense granules, and synthesize and release **thromboxane A2**.
- ADP and thromboxane A2 act as platelet agonists, activating ambient platelets and recruiting them to the site of injury.
- Disruption of the vessel wall also exposes **tissue factor**-expressing cells, initiating coagulation by binding factor VIIa.
- **Activated platelets potentiate coagulation** by providing a surface for clotting factor binding and assembly of activation complexes that enhance thrombin generation.
- **Thrombin** is a potent platelet agonist, amplifying platelet recruitment and its own generation through feedback activation of factors V, VIII, and XI. Thrombin also activates factor XIII, which cross-links fibrin strands to solidify the fibrin network.
- When platelets are activated, **Gp IIb/IIIa** (the most abundant platelet receptor) undergoes a conformational change, enabling it to bind **fibrinogen** and, under high shear conditions, **VWF**.
- Divalent fibrinogen or multivalent VWF molecules bridge adjacent platelets, forming aggregates. Fibrin strands, generated by thrombin, then weave these aggregates together to form a platelet/fibrin thrombus.

Antiplatelet drugs target various steps in this process. Commonly used classes include aspirin, ADP receptor inhibitors, dipyridamole, Gp IIb/IIIa antagonists, and vorapaxar.

### Aspirin

Aspirin is the **most widely used** antiplatelet agent globally, serving as the foundation for most antiplatelet strategies due to its cost-effectiveness and efficacy.

- **Mechanism of Action**: Aspirin produces its antithrombotic effect by **irreversibly acetylating and inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1**, an enzyme critical for thromboxane A2 biosynthesis. At high doses (~1 g/d), it also inhibits COX-2, an inducible isoform in endothelial and inflammatory cells that synthesizes prostacyclin.
- **Indications**:
    - Widely used for **secondary prevention of cardiovascular events** in patients with established coronary artery, cerebral artery, or peripheral artery disease, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 25% compared with placebo.
    - Use for **primary prevention is controversial** as recent studies question if benefits outweigh risks of gastrointestinal and intracerebral hemorrhage. It is generally **no longer recommended for primary cardiac prevention** unless the baseline cardiovascular risk is at least 1% per year and 10% at 10 years, and patients are at low risk for bleeding.
- **Dosages**:
    - Typically 75–325 mg once daily.
    - Higher doses are not more effective, and some analyses suggest reduced efficacy.
    - **75–100 mg daily** is recommended for most indications due to dose-related side effects.
    - For rapid platelet inhibition, an initial dose of at least **160 mg** should be given.
- **Side Effects**:
    - Most common: **Gastrointestinal issues**, ranging from dyspepsia to erosive gastritis or peptic ulcers with bleeding and perforation, which are dose-related. Enteric-coated or buffered aspirin does not eliminate these.
    - Overall risk of **major bleeding is 1–3% per year**. The risk increases two- to threefold when aspirin is combined with other antiplatelet drugs (e.g., clopidogrel) or anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin). When dual or triple therapy is prescribed, **low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg daily)** should be given.
    - Eradication of _Helicobacter pylori_ infection and administration of proton pump inhibitors may reduce the risk of aspirin-induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with peptic ulcer disease.
    - **Contraindicated in patients with aspirin allergy** characterized by bronchospasm (~0.3% of general population, more common in those with chronic urticaria, asthma, nasal polyps, or chronic rhinitis).
    - Hepatic and renal toxicity can occur with overdose.
- **Aspirin Resistance**:
    - **Clinical aspirin resistance** (failure to protect patients from ischemic vascular events) is not a helpful definition, as it is made after the event and aspirin does not prevent all vascular events.
    - **Biochemical aspirin resistance** refers to the drug's failure to produce expected inhibitory effects on platelet function tests, such as thromboxane A2 synthesis or arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation.
    - Potential causes include poor compliance, reduced absorption, drug-drug interaction with ibuprofen, and overexpression of COX-2.
    - Tests for aspirin resistance are not well standardized, and there is little evidence they identify patients at increased risk or that resistance can be reversed by higher doses or other antiplatelet drugs. Currently, it remains a research tool.

### ADP Receptor Antagonists

These drugs target **P2Y12**, the key ADP receptor on platelets. This class includes thienopyridines (clopidogrel and prasugrel), ticagrelor, and cangrelor.

#### Thienopyridines (Clopidogrel and Prasugrel)

- **Mechanism of Action**: Selectively inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation by **irreversibly blocking P2Y12**. Both clopidogrel and prasugrel are **prodrugs** requiring metabolic activation by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. **Prasugrel** is about 10-fold more potent than clopidogrel and has a more rapid onset due to better absorption and more streamlined metabolic activation.
- **Indications**:
    - **Clopidogrel**: Compared with aspirin, it reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke by 8.7% in patients with recent ischemic stroke, recent MI, or peripheral arterial disease. It is more effective but also more expensive than aspirin.
    - **Combination therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin)** is often used to block complementary platelet activation pathways. It is recommended for at least 4 weeks after bare metal stent implantation and for at least a year in those with a drug-eluting stent (some experts suggest long-term use for drug-eluting stents due to concerns about late in-stent thrombosis).
    - The combination is also effective in unstable angina, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 20% relative to aspirin alone. However, combining clopidogrel with aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding to about 2% per year, even with low-dose aspirin (≤100 mg). This combination should only be used when there is a clear benefit; for example, it has not proven superior to clopidogrel alone in acute ischemic stroke or to aspirin alone for primary prevention.
    - **Prasugrel**: In patients with acute coronary syndromes scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), prasugrel significantly lowered the incidence of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (9.9% vs. 12.1% with clopidogrel), mainly reflecting a reduction in nonfatal MI. It also significantly reduced stent thrombosis (1.1% vs. 2.4%). However, these advantages came at the cost of significantly higher rates of **fatal bleeding**(0.4% vs. 0.1%) and **life-threatening bleeding** (1.4% vs. 0.9%).
    - Prasugrel is generally **avoided in patients older than 75 years** and **contraindicated in those with a history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack** due to a particularly high bleeding risk. Caution is advised in patients weighing less than 60 kg or with renal impairment.
    - It failed to reduce the primary efficacy endpoint in patients with unstable angina or MI without ST-segment elevation. Therefore, prasugrel is **reserved for patients undergoing PCI**, usually with aspirin (daily aspirin dose ≤100 mg to reduce bleeding risk).
    - For patients with noncardioembolic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack, the combination of **clopidogrel or ticagrelor plus aspirin for 21–30 days** followed by aspirin alone reduces the risk of stroke, MI, and vascular death by up to 30% compared with aspirin alone. Dual antiplatelet therapy is often administered for the first 3–4 weeks in such patients.
- **Dosing**:
    - **Clopidogrel** is given once daily at a dose of **75 mg**. Loading doses of 300–600 mg are used for rapid ADP receptor blockade (e.g., for coronary stenting), producing inhibition in about 4–6 hours.
    - **Prasugrel** is initiated with a 60 mg loading dose, followed by **10 mg once daily**. Patients older than 75 years or weighing less than 60 kg should receive a lower daily dose of **5 mg**.
- **Side Effects**:
    - The most common side effect is **bleeding**, which is more frequent with prasugrel due to its greater potency.
    - To reduce bleeding risk, clopidogrel and prasugrel should be **stopped 5–7 days before major surgery**.
    - Platelet transfusion may be helpful for serious bleeding.
    - Rare hematologic side effects include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
- **Thienopyridine Resistance**:
    - The capacity of clopidogrel to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation varies among individuals, partly due to **genetic polymorphisms in CYP isoenzymes**, particularly **CYP2C19**.
    - Patients with the **loss-of-function CYP2C19*2 allele** show reduced platelet inhibition and a higher rate of cardiovascular events. This allele is carried by up to 25% of whites, 30% of African Americans, and 50% of Asians, potentially making them resistant to clopidogrel. Other reduced function alleles (*3, *4, or *5) may also lead to less benefit.
    - Concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors (CYP2C19 inhibitors) causes a small reduction in clopidogrel's inhibitory effects, though the extent to which this increases cardiovascular event risk is controversial.
    - CYP2C19 polymorphisms appear less important for prasugrel activation.
    - Pharmacogenetic profiling and point-of-care assessment of clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition are research tools, with clinical trials for these possibilities being negative so far.
    - While higher doses of clopidogrel can overcome a reduced response, the clinical benefit is uncertain. **Prasugrel or ticagrelor may be better choices** for clopidogrel-resistant patients.

#### Ticagrelor

Ticagrelor is an orally active P2Y12 inhibitor that differs from thienopyridines because it **does not require metabolic activation** and produces **reversible inhibition** of the ADP receptor.

- **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits P2Y12, leading to a more rapid onset and offset of action than clopidogrel, and greater, more predictable inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation.
- **Indications**:
    - Indicated for **secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events** in patients with acute coronary syndrome (treated medically, with PCI +/- stent, or CABG surgery).
    - Also indicated for up to 3 years for secondary prevention in patients with a prior MI (at least one year ago) who are at high risk for atherothrombotic events.
    - Guidelines prefer ticagrelor over clopidogrel for acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing PCI, particularly in higher risk patients.
- **Dosing**:
    - Initiated with an oral loading dose of **180 mg**.
    - Followed by **90 mg twice daily**.
    - No dose adjustment needed for renal impairment.
    - Caution is required in patients with hepatic disease and those receiving potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, as ticagrelor is metabolized in the liver via CYP3A4.
    - Usually administered with aspirin; the daily aspirin dose **should not exceed 100 mg**.
- **Side Effects**:
    - In addition to bleeding, common side effects include **dyspnea** (occurring in up to 15% of patients, usually self-limiting and mild, mechanism unknown) and **asymptomatic ventricular pauses**.
    - To reduce bleeding risk, ticagrelor should be **stopped at least 5 days before major surgery**.
    - Platelet transfusion is unlikely to be beneficial for ticagrelor-related bleeding or in urgent surgery, as the drug binds to P2Y12 on transfused platelets.
    - Bentracimab, an antibody fragment, is under development for ticagrelor reversal.

#### Cangrelor

Cangrelor is a **rapidly acting reversible P2Y12 inhibitor** administered intravenously.

- It has an **immediate onset of action**, a half-life of 3–5 minutes, and an offset of action within an hour.
- **Licensed for use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)**, providing rapid ADP receptor blockade in those not pretreated with clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor.
- **Dosing**: Administered as a **30 μg/kg IV bolus** before PCI, followed by an infusion of **4 μg/kg per minute** for at least 2 hours or the duration of the procedure, whichever is longer.
- **Transitioning to oral P2Y12 inhibitor therapy**:
    - Ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose) can be given at any time during the cangrelor infusion or immediately after discontinuation.
    - Loading doses of prasugrel (60 mg) or clopidogrel (600 mg) should **only be given after cangrelor is stopped**, as cangrelor blocks the interaction of their active metabolites with P2Y12.

### Dipyridamole

Dipyridamole is a relatively **weak antiplatelet agent on its own**. An extended-release formulation combined with low-dose aspirin, known as **Aggrenox**, is sometimes used for secondary prevention in patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or ischemic stroke.

- **Mechanism of Action**:
    - Inhibits **phosphodiesterase**, blocking the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels reduce intracellular calcium and inhibit platelet activation.
    - Blocks the uptake of **adenosine** by platelets and other cells, further increasing local cyclic AMP levels because the platelet adenosine A2 receptor is coupled to adenylate cyclase.
- **Indications**:
    - Dipyridamole plus aspirin reduced the risk of stroke by 22.1% compared with aspirin and by 24.4% compared with dipyridamole alone in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA.
    - Another trial showed combination therapy reduced vascular death, stroke, or MI to 13% compared with 16% for aspirin alone in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.
    - A large trial comparing Aggrenox with clopidogrel in noncardioembolic ischemic stroke showed similar recurrent stroke rates (9.0% vs. 8.8%), but the study failed to meet noninferiority criteria for Aggrenox, dampening enthusiasm for its use.
    - Due to its vasodilatory effects and limited data for patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, **Aggrenox should not be used for stroke prevention in such patients**; clopidogrel is a better choice.
- **Dosing**: Aggrenox is given twice daily, with each capsule containing **200 mg of extended-release dipyridamole and 25 mg of aspirin**.
- **Side Effects**:
    - Due to its **vasodilatory effects**, it must be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease.
    - Gastrointestinal complaints, headache, facial flushing, dizziness, and hypotension can occur, but often subside with continued use.

### Gp IIb/IIIa Receptor Antagonists

This class of parenteral drugs has a niche in patients with acute coronary syndrome. The three agents are **abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban**.

- **Mechanism of Action**:
    
    - **Gp IIb/IIIa** is the most abundant receptor on the platelet surface (~80,000 copies per platelet), a member of the integrin family. It is inactive on resting platelets but undergoes conformational activation upon platelet activation.
    - Once activated, Gp IIb/IIIa binds adhesive molecules like **fibrinogen** and, under high shear conditions, **VWF**. This binding is mediated by the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence found on fibrinogen α chains and VWF, and by the Lys-Gly-Asp (KGD) sequence on fibrinogen γ chains.
    - Divalent fibrinogen or multivalent VWF molecules bridge adjacent platelets together, inducing platelet aggregation.
    - While all three agents target Gp IIb/IIIa, they are structurally and pharmacologically distinct.
        - **Abciximab** is a Fab fragment of a humanized murine monoclonal antibody directed against the _activated_ form of Gp IIb/IIIa. It binds with high affinity and blocks adhesive molecule binding. It has a **long half-life** and can be detected on platelets for up to 2 weeks.
        - **Eptifibatide** is a synthetic small cyclic heptapeptide that incorporates the KGD motif. It has a **short half-life**.
        - **Tirofiban** is a synthetic nonpeptidic tyrosine derivative that acts as an RGD mimetic. It also has a **short half-life**.
- **Table 118-1: Features of Gp IIb/IIIa Antagonists**
    

|Feature|Abciximab|Eptifibatide|Tirofiban|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Type**|Fab fragment|Cyclic heptapeptide|Nonpeptidic derivative|
|**Target Affinity**|Activated Gp IIb/IIIa|Gp IIb/IIIa (KGD mimetic)|Gp IIb/IIIa (RGD mimetic)|
|**Half-life**|Long|Short|Short|

- **Indications**:
    - **Abciximab and eptifibatide** are used in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), particularly those not pretreated with an ADP receptor antagonist.
    - **Tirofiban** is used in high-risk patients with unstable angina. Eptifibatide can also be used for this indication.
- **Dosing**: All Gp IIb/IIIa antagonists are given as an IV bolus followed by an infusion.
    - **Abciximab**: 0.25 mg/kg bolus, then 0.125 μg/kg per minute infusion (max 10 μg/kg) for 12 hours.
    - **Eptifibatide**:
        - For PCI: Two 180 μg/kg boluses given 10 minutes apart, followed by a 2.0 μg/kg per minute infusion for 18–24 hours.
        - For acute coronary syndrome: The second bolus is withheld.
        - Dose must be reduced to 1 μg/kg per minute in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 50 mL/min).
    - **Tirofiban**: Started at 0.4 μg/kg per minute for 30 minutes, then continued at 0.1 μg/kg per minute for up to 18 hours.
        - Dose is cut in half for patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min).
- **Side Effects**:
    - In addition to **bleeding**, **thrombocytopenia** is the most serious complication.
    - Thrombocytopenia is immune-mediated, caused by antibodies against neoantigens on Gp IIb/IIIa exposed upon antagonist binding.
    - With **abciximab**, thrombocytopenia occurs in up to 5% of patients, with severe cases in ~1%. It is less common with eptifibatide and tirofiban (~1% of patients).

### Vorapaxar

Vorapaxar is an orally active **PAR-1 antagonist** that blocks **thrombin-induced platelet activation**. It has a long half-life of about 200 hours.

- **Indications**:
    - In a trial for acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation, vorapaxar failed to significantly reduce the primary efficacy endpoint (a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, recurrent ischemia requiring rehospitalization, and urgent coronary revascularization). It was also associated with **increased rates of bleeding, including intracranial bleeding**.
    - In a second trial for secondary prevention (prior MI, ischemic stroke, or peripheral arterial disease), vorapaxar reduced the risk for cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 13%, but **doubled the risk of intracranial bleeding**.
    - In the prespecified subgroup of patients with prior MI, vorapaxar reduced the risk for cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 20%.
    - Based on these data, vorapaxar is licensed for patients **younger than 75 years** with **MI or peripheral artery disease** who have **no history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or intracranial bleeding**, and weigh **more than 60 kg**.
- **Dosing**: Given at a dose of **2.08 mg once daily**.
- **Side Effects**: The major side effect is **bleeding**. Platelet transfusion may be beneficial for vorapaxar reversal.

## ANTICOAGULANTS

Both parenteral and oral anticoagulants are available. Parenteral agents include heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, lepirudin, desirudin, bivalirudin, and argatroban. Oral anticoagulants include warfarin, dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

### Parenteral Anticoagulants

#### Heparin

Heparin is a sulfated polysaccharide isolated from mammalian tissues, commonly from porcine intestinal mucosa. It is a polymer of alternating D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues.

- **Mechanism of Action**:
    
    - Heparin acts by **activating antithrombin**, accelerating the rate at which antithrombin inhibits clotting enzymes, particularly **thrombin** and **factor Xa**. Antithrombin is the obligatory plasma cofactor for heparin.
    - Heparin binds to antithrombin via a unique **pentasaccharide sequence** (found on one-third of commercial heparin chains), inducing a conformational change in antithrombin that enhances its inhibition of factor Xa by at least two orders of magnitude.
    - To catalyze thrombin inhibition, heparin serves as a template, simultaneously binding antithrombin and thrombin to promote the formation of a stable covalent thrombin-antithrombin complex.
    - Only pentasaccharide-containing heparin chains composed of at least 18 saccharide units (molecular weight of 5400) are long enough to bridge thrombin and antithrombin. With a mean molecular weight of 15,000, almost all unfractionated heparin chains are long enough.
    - Consequently, heparin has **equal capacity to promote the inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa** by antithrombin, with an anti-factor Xa to anti-factor IIa (thrombin) ratio of 1:1.
    - Heparin also causes the release of **tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)** from the endothelium, which may contribute to its antithrombotic activity; longer heparin chains release more TFPI.
- **Pharmacology**:
    
    - Must be given parenterally, usually subcutaneously (SC) or by continuous IV infusion (IV route most common for therapeutic purposes). High SC doses are needed for treatment to overcome limited bioavailability.
    - In circulation, heparin binds to endothelium and plasma proteins other than antithrombin, reducing its anticoagulant activity.
    - Its dose-dependent clearance is due to binding to endothelial cells; at low doses, half-life is short, but at higher doses, it's longer once the endothelium is saturated. Clearance is mainly extrarenal (macrophages internalize and depolymerize). Plasma half-life ranges from 30 to 60 minutes for bolus IV doses of 25 and 100 units/kg, respectively.
    - Binding to plasma proteins (e.g., acute-phase reactants, VWF multimers, platelet factor 4 (PF4)) reduces its anticoagulant activity. Large amounts of PF4 near platelet-rich arterial thrombi can neutralize heparin.
    - The anticoagulant response to fixed or weight-adjusted heparin doses is **unpredictable** due to varying levels of heparin-binding proteins. Therefore, **coagulation monitoring is essential**.
- **Monitoring the Anticoagulant Effect**:
    
    - Heparin therapy can be monitored using the **activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)** or **anti–factor Xa level**.
    - While aPTT is often used, reagent and coagulometer variations require laboratories to establish a therapeutic aPTT range (typically a **two- to threefold prolongation**) by correlating with anti–factor Xa levels.
    - Therapeutic **anti–factor Xa levels range from 0.3 to 0.7 units/mL**.
    - Up to 25% of heparin-treated patients for VTE are considered **heparin resistant** (requiring >35,000 units/d for therapeutic aPTT). Many of these have therapeutic anti–factor Xa levels despite subtherapeutic aPTT, possibly due to elevated fibrinogen and factor VIII (acute-phase proteins) shortening the aPTT. In such cases, anti–factor Xa levels are preferred for monitoring. Patients with antithrombin deficiency or elevated heparin-binding proteins may also need high doses.
- **Dosing**:
    
    - For prophylaxis, heparin is usually given in fixed SC doses of **5000 units two or three times daily**, without coagulation monitoring.
    - For therapeutic doses, monitoring is essential. Fixed-dose or weight-based nomograms are used to standardize dosing.
    - For **acute coronary syndromes**, an IV heparin bolus of 5000 units or 70 units/kg is typically followed by an infusion rate of **12–15 units/kg per hour**.
    - For **venous thromboembolism**, an initial bolus of 5000 units or 80 units/kg is used, followed by an infusion of **18 units/kg per hour**. Patients with VTE may require higher doses than those with acute coronary syndromes, possibly reflecting differences in thrombus burden (heparin binds to fibrin, and extensive DVT has more fibrin).
- **Limitations**:
    
    - **Pharmacokinetic limitations** stem from heparin's propensity to bind in a pentasaccharide-independent manner to cells and plasma proteins, leading to dose-dependent clearance and a variable anticoagulant response (heparin resistance).
    - **Biophysical limitations** include the inability of the heparin-antithrombin complex to inhibit factor Xa when it's incorporated into the prothrombinase complex, or to inhibit thrombin bound to fibrin. This means factor Xa on activated platelets within thrombi can still generate thrombin, which, once bound to fibrin, is protected from inhibition. Clot-associated thrombin can then promote thrombus growth. High concentrations of PF4 within platelet-rich thrombi can also neutralize heparin.
- **Table 118-2: Pharmacokinetic and Biophysical Limitations of Heparin**
    

|Category|Limitation|
|:--|:--|
|**Pharmacokinetic**|Propensity to bind in a pentasaccharide-independent fashion to cells and plasma proteins, leading to dose-dependent clearance, variable anticoagulant response, and heparin resistance.|
|**Biophysical**|Inability of heparin-antithrombin complex to inhibit factor Xa when incorporated into the prothrombinase complex.|
||Inability of heparin-antithrombin complex to inhibit thrombin bound to fibrin.|

- **Side Effects**:
    - Most common: **Bleeding** (risk increases with dose and concomitant drugs affecting hemostasis, or recent surgery/trauma).
    - **Antidote**: **Protamine sulfate** (a mixture of basic polypeptides from salmon sperm) can neutralize heparin by binding it. Typically, **1 mg of protamine sulfate neutralizes 100 units of heparin**, given IV (slow IV infusion recommended to reduce anaphylactoid reactions).
    - **Thrombocytopenia (Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, HIT)**: An antibody-mediated process triggered by antibodies against neoantigens on PF4 (exposed when heparin binds to it). IgG antibodies bind to the heparin-PF4 complex and platelet Fc receptors, activating platelets and generating prothrombotic microparticles.
        - **Clinical Features of HIT** (summarized from text):
            - Typically occurs **5–14 days after heparin initiation**, but can be earlier with prior heparin exposure (within 3 months).
            - Suspicion raised by platelet count <100,000/μL or a 50% decrease from pretreatment value.
            - More common in surgical patients and females.
            - Can be associated with **thrombosis** (venous thrombosis, e.g., DVT/PE, is more common than arterial thrombosis, e.g., ischemic stroke, acute MI, critical limb ischemia).
        - **Diagnosis**: Enzyme-linked assays detect antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes (sensitive, but can be positive without clinical HIT). The most specific diagnostic test is the **serotonin release assay**.
        - **Management**: **Heparin must be stopped**, and an alternative anticoagulant administered to prevent or treat thrombosis. Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, bivalirudin) or factor Xa inhibitors (fondaparinux, rivaroxaban) are commonly used.
        - **Vaccine Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT)** is a rare, HIT-like complication after adenovirus COVID-19 vaccines (4–28 days post-vaccination), characterized by thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (cerebral/splanchnic vein thrombosis, DVT/PE). Diagnosis involves antibodies against PF4 and a positive serotonin release assay with added PF4. Treatment includes intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, plasma exchange, and anticoagulants (argatroban, fondaparinux, or rivaroxaban).
        - **Warfarin use in HIT patients**: These patients often have increased thrombin generation, leading to protein C consumption. Administering warfarin without a concomitant anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin or thrombin generation can cause a further decrease in protein C, triggering **skin necrosis**. To avoid this, HIT patients should be treated with a direct thrombin inhibitor or fondaparinux until the platelet count normalizes. Then, low-dose warfarin can be introduced, and the parenteral anticoagulant discontinued when the INR has been therapeutic for at least 2 days. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are also an option.
    - **Osteoporosis**: Therapeutic heparin doses for >1 month can cause bone density reduction (up to 30% of patients), with symptomatic vertebral fractures in 2–3%. Heparin decreases bone formation and enhances bone resorption, affecting both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.
    - **Elevated Levels of Transaminases**: Modest elevations in hepatic transaminases are frequently observed with therapeutic heparin, typically without bilirubin increase. Levels normalize rapidly upon stopping the drug. The mechanism is unknown.

#### Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH)

LMWH consists of smaller heparin fragments (mean molecular weight ~5000, one-third of unfractionated heparin) prepared by controlled enzymatic or chemical depolymerization. LMWH has several advantages over unfractionated heparin.

- **Table 118-5: Advantages of LMWH Over Heparin**

|Advantage|
|:--|
|Greater bioavailability after SC injection|
|Longer plasma half-life|
|More predictable anticoagulant response|
|No routine coagulation monitoring required|
|Lower risk of major bleeding|
|Lower risk of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)|
|Lower risk of osteoporosis|

- **Mechanism of Action**: Like heparin, LMWH acts by activating antithrombin. At least half of the pentasaccharide-containing LMWH chains are too short to bridge thrombin to antithrombin. However, these chains retain the capacity to accelerate factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin due to conformational changes in antithrombin evoked by pentasaccharide binding. Consequently, LMWH catalyzes **factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin more than thrombin inhibition**. LMWH preparations have anti–factor Xa to anti–factor IIa ratios ranging from **2:1 to 4:1**.
- **Pharmacology**:
    - Usually given SC, but can be administered IV for rapid anticoagulant response.
    - LMWH has pharmacokinetic advantages over unfractionated heparin because its shorter chains bind less avidly to endothelial cells, macrophages, and heparin-binding plasma proteins. This eliminates the rapid, dose-dependent, saturable clearance mechanism of unfractionated heparin, leading to dose-independent clearance and a **longer plasma half-life (~4 hours** based on anti–factor Xa levels).
    - It is cleared almost exclusively by the **kidneys** and can accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency.
    - Exhibits ~90% bioavailability after SC injection.
    - Binds less avidly to plasma heparin-binding proteins, resulting in a **more predictable dose response**, and resistance to LMWH is rare.
    - Due to its longer half-life and predictable response, LMWH can be given SC **once or twice daily without coagulation monitoring**, even for treatment doses. These properties make LMWH more convenient than unfractionated heparin.
    - Studies in patients with VTE have shown that home treatment with LMWH is as effective and safe as in-hospital treatment with continuous IV heparin, streamlining care, reducing costs, and increasing patient satisfaction.
- **Monitoring**:
    - In most patients, LMWH **does not require coagulation monitoring**.
    - If monitoring is necessary, **anti–factor Xa levels** must be measured because most LMWH preparations have little effect on the aPTT.
    - Therapeutic anti–factor Xa levels (measured 3–4 hours after administration) range from **0.5 to 1.2 units/mL for once-daily doses** and **1.0 to 2.0 units/mL for twice-daily doses**.
    - For prophylactic doses, peak anti–factor Xa levels of **0.2–0.5 units/mL** are desirable.
    - **Indications for LMWH monitoring** include renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min to prevent drug accumulation), obesity (though weight-adjusted dosing is generally effective, it hasn't been extensively evaluated in morbid obesity). Monitoring is also advisable during pregnancy (as dose requirements can change, especially in the third trimester), and in high-risk settings such as pregnant women with mechanical heart valves or when LMWH is used in treatment doses in infants or children.
- **Dosing**: Doses vary by LMWH preparation.
    - For prophylaxis, once-daily SC doses of **4000–5000 units** or twice-daily doses of **2500–3000 units** are common.
    - For VTE treatment, a dose of **150–200 units/kg once daily** or **100 units/kg twice daily** is used.
    - In unstable angina, LMWH is given SC twice daily at a dose of **100–120 units/kg**.
- **Side Effects**:
    - The major complication is **bleeding**. Meta-analyses suggest a lower risk of major bleeding with LMWH than with unfractionated heparin.
    - Bleeding is more common with concomitant antiplatelet or fibrinolytic therapy, recent surgery, trauma, or underlying hemostatic defects.
    - **Antidote**: While **protamine sulfate** can be used, it **incompletely neutralizes** the anticoagulant activity of LMWH. It completely reverses the anti–factor IIa activity (due to binding longer chains responsible for thrombin inhibition) but only partially reverses the anti–factor Xa activity (as shorter pentasaccharide-containing chains do not bind to protamine sulfate). Patients at high risk for bleeding may be more safely treated with continuous IV unfractionated heparin than SC LMWH.
    - **Thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: The risk of HIT is about **fivefold lower** with LMWH than with heparin. LMWH binds less avidly to platelets and causes less PF4 release, and its lower affinity for PF4 makes it less likely to induce the conformational changes that trigger HIT antibodies. **LMWH should NOT be used to treat HIT patients** because most HIT antibodies exhibit cross-reactivity with LMWH, and there are case reports of thrombosis when patients were switched from heparin to LMWH.
    - **Osteoporosis**: The risk of osteoporosis is lower with LMWH than with heparin, making LMWH a better choice for extended treatment.

#### Fondaparinux

Fondaparinux is a synthetic analogue of the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide sequence, differing from LMWH in several ways.

- **Table 118-6: Comparison of LMWH and Fondaparinux**

|Feature|LMWH|Fondaparinux|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Mean Molecular Weight**|~5000|1728|
|**Renal Excretion**|Partially|Completely|
|**Protamine Reversal**|Partially|Not reversed|
|**HIT Cross-Reactivity**|Some|None|

- **Mechanism of Action**: As a synthetic analogue of the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide sequence, fondaparinux has a molecular weight of 1728. It binds **only to antithrombin** and is too short to bridge thrombin to antithrombin. Consequently, fondaparinux catalyzes **factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin** but does not enhance the rate of thrombin inhibition.
- **Pharmacology**:
    - Exhibits **complete bioavailability** after SC injection.
    - It does not bind to endothelial cells or plasma proteins, resulting in **dose-independent clearance** and a plasma half-life of **17 hours**.
    - Given SC once daily.
    - Cleared unchanged via the **kidneys**.
    - **Contraindicated in patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min** and should be used with caution in those with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.
- **Dosing**: Produces a predictable anticoagulant response in fixed doses because it does not bind to plasma proteins.
    - For prevention of VTE: **2.5 mg once daily**.
    - For initial treatment of established VTE: **7.5 mg once daily** (can be reduced to 5 mg for those weighing <50 kg and increased to 10 mg for those >100 kg). It is as effective as heparin or LMWH for VTE treatment and produces similar bleeding rates.
    - Used at a dose of **2.5 mg once daily** in patients with acute coronary syndrome. In non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, this prophylactic dose of fondaparinux resulted in a 50% lower rate of major bleeding compared to treatment doses of enoxaparin (likely due to the lower dose).
    - In acute coronary syndrome patients requiring PCI, there is a risk of catheter thrombosis with fondaparinux unless adjunctive heparin is given at the time of the procedure.
- **Indications**: Licensed for thromboprophylaxis in general medical or surgical patients and high-risk orthopedic patients. Also, as an alternative to heparin or LMWH for initial treatment of established VTE. Although used in Europe for acute coronary syndrome, it is not licensed for this indication in the United States.
- **Side Effects**:
    - **Does not cause HIT** because it does not bind to PF4, and there is no cross-reactivity with HIT antibodies. It appears effective for treating HIT patients, though large clinical trials are lacking.
    - The major side effect is **bleeding**.
    - **No antidote**. Protamine sulfate has no effect as it fails to bind to the drug. Recombinant activated factor VII reverses its effects in volunteers, but its ability to control fondaparinux-induced bleeding is unknown.

#### Parenteral Direct Thrombin Inhibitors

These inhibitors bind directly to thrombin and block its interaction with its substrates. Approved parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors include recombinant hirudins (lepirudin and desirudin, which are no longer available), argatroban, and bivalirudin.

- **Table 118-7: Comparison of the Properties of Lepirudin, Bivalirudin, and Argatroban**

|Property|Lepirudin (No longer available)|Bivalirudin|Argatroban|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Source**|Recombinant hirudin|Synthetic peptide|Synthetic nonpeptide|
|**Route**|IV|IV|IV|
|**Molecular Weight**|7 kDa|2.2 kDa|0.5 kDa|
|**Half-life**|80 min|25 min|~45 min|
|**Clearance**|Renal|Renal/Proteolysis|Hepatic|
|**Monitoring**|aPTT, ECT|ACT, aPTT|aPTT|
|**Antidote**|None|None|None|
|**HIT Use**|Yes|Yes|Yes|

- **Argatroban**:
    - A univalent inhibitor targeting the active site of thrombin.
    - Metabolized in the **liver**, so use with caution in hepatic insufficiency.
    - **Not cleared via the kidneys**, making it safer than fondaparinux for HIT patients with renal impairment.
    - Administered by continuous IV infusion, with a plasma half-life of ~45 minutes.
    - The **aPTT** is used to monitor its anticoagulant effect, targeting 1.5–3 times the baseline value, not to exceed 100 seconds.
    - It prolongs the INR, which can complicate the transition to warfarin; this can be managed by using factor X levels for warfarin monitoring or by stopping argatroban 2–3 hours before INR determination.
    - Licensed for treatment of patients with **HIT**.
- **Bivalirudin**:
    - A synthetic 20-amino-acid analogue of hirudin and a **divalent thrombin inhibitor** (N-terminus interacts with thrombin's active site, C-terminus binds to exosite 1).
    - Has the **shortest plasma half-life** (25 minutes) among parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors.
    - Degraded by peptidases and partially excreted via the kidneys.
    - Anticoagulant activity is monitored using the **activated clotting time (ACT)** at high doses (e.g., in the cardiac catheterization laboratory) or the **aPTT** at lower doses.
    - Licensed as an alternative to heparin in patients undergoing **percutaneous coronary intervention**. It has been used successfully in HIT patients requiring PCI or cardiac bypass surgery.

### Oral Anticoagulants

For many years, warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist) was the only oral anticoagulant available. This changed with the introduction of **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**, which include dabigatran (a thrombin inhibitor) and rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban (factor Xa inhibitors). DOACs have a rapid onset and offset of action and half-lives that allow once- or twice-daily administration. They are designed to produce a predictable level of anticoagulation and are more convenient than warfarin as they are given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring. DOACs are small molecules that bind reversibly to the active site of their target enzyme.

#### Warfarin

Warfarin is a water-soluble vitamin K antagonist and a coumarin derivative.

- **Mechanism of Action**: Warfarin interferes with the synthesis of **vitamin K–dependent clotting proteins**(prothrombin, factors VII, IX, and X) and vitamin K–dependent anticoagulant proteins (proteins C and S).
    - It inhibits **vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR)**, which is crucial for recycling oxidized vitamin K into its reduced form. Reduced vitamin K is a cofactor for a carboxylase that adds a carboxyl group to glutamic acid residues on clotting factors, a modification essential for their calcium-dependent binding to phospholipid surfaces.
    - Inhibiting VKOR results in the synthesis of partially γ-carboxylated proteins with little or no biological activity.
    - The **onset of action of warfarin is delayed** until the newly synthesized, less active clotting factors gradually replace their fully active counterparts. Its antithrombotic effect depends on reducing functional levels of factor X (half-life 24 hours) and prothrombin (half-life 72 hours).
    - Because of this delay, patients with established thrombosis or at high risk for it require **concomitant treatment with a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant** (e.g., heparin, LMWH, or fondaparinux) for at least 5 days.
- **Pharmacology**:
    - Warfarin is a racemic mixture of R and S isomers; the S isomer is more active. It is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the GI tract, with blood levels peaking around 90 minutes.
    - Racemic warfarin has a plasma half-life of **36–42 hours**, and >97% is bound to albumin (only the unbound fraction is active).
    - Metabolized in the liver; the more active S isomer is metabolized by **CYP2C9**. Two common variants, **CYP2C9_2 and CYP2C9_3**, encode an enzyme with reduced activity, leading patients with these variants to require **lower maintenance doses of warfarin** (20–30% lower for heterozygotes, 50–70% lower for homozygotes). Carriers of these variants have an almost twofold higher risk of warfarin-associated bleeding.
    - **Polymorphisms in VKORC1** also influence the anticoagulant response to warfarin, explaining 30% of the variability in dose requirements. VKORC1 variants are more prevalent than CYP2C9 variants, with the highest prevalence in Asians. The FDA has amended prescribing information for warfarin to suggest lower initiation doses for patients with CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variants.
    - In addition to genetic factors, warfarin's anticoagulant effect is influenced by **dietary vitamin K intake, other drugs, and various disease states**. Due to this variability, **coagulation monitoring is essential**.
- **Table 118-8: Frequencies of CYP2C9 Genotypes and VKORC1 Haplotypes in Different Populations and their Effect on Warfarin Dose Requirements**

|Genotype/Haplotype|White (%)|African American (%)|Asian (%)|Warfarin Dose Effect Compared to Wild-Type/Non-A Homozygotes|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|*_CYP2C9*1/_1__|55|80|75|Normal|
|*_CYP2C9*1/_2__|20|10|10|Decreased by 20–30%|
|*_CYP2C9*1/_3__|10|5|5|Decreased by 20–30%|
|*_CYP2C9*2/_2__|5|1|1|Decreased by 50–70%|
|*_CYP2C9*2/_3__|5|1|1|Decreased by 50–70%|
|*_CYP2C9*3/_3__|5|3|8|Decreased by 50–70%|
|**VKORC1 non-A/non-A**|20|80|10|Normal|
|**VKORC1 A/non-A**|50|15|30|Decreased by 25%|
|**VKORC1 A/A**|30|5|60|Decreased by 50%|

- **Monitoring**:
    - Warfarin therapy is most often monitored using the **prothrombin time (PT)**, which is sensitive to reductions in factor II, VII, and X levels. PT reagents vary in sensitivity.
    - The **International Normalized Ratio (INR)** was developed to standardize PT results. INR is calculated as (patient's PT / mean normal PT) multiplied by the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) of the thromboplastin reagent. Sensitive thromboplastins have an ISI near 1.0, with most current ISIs ranging from 0.9 to 1.4.
    - Despite INR, problems persist, including variability in precision depending on reagent-coagulometer combinations, unreliable ISI reporting, and the need for each laboratory to establish the mean normal PT for new reagent batches using healthy volunteers.
    - For most indications, warfarin is administered to achieve a target **INR of 2.0–3.0**. An exception is patients with mechanical heart valves (especially in the mitral position or older ball and cage aortic valves), for whom a target INR of **2.5–3.5** is recommended.
    - Studies in atrial fibrillation show an increased risk of cardioembolic stroke when INR falls below 1.7 and an increase in bleeding with INR values >4.5, highlighting warfarin's **narrow therapeutic window**.
- **Dosing**:
    - Warfarin is usually started at a dose of **5–10 mg**. Lower doses are used for patients with CYP2C9 or VKORC1 polymorphisms. The dose is then titrated to achieve the desired target INR.
    - Due to its delayed onset of action, patients with established thrombosis or high risk require **concomitant initial treatment with a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant** (e.g., heparin, LMWH, or fondaparinux). This parenteral anticoagulant should be continued until the INR has been therapeutic for at least 2 consecutive days, with a minimum 5-day course recommended to ensure factor Xa and prothrombin levels are reduced.
    - **Frequent coagulation monitoring is essential** to maintain a therapeutic response. Even stable patients need INR checks every 3–4 weeks, and more frequent monitoring is necessary when new medications are introduced due to numerous drug interactions.
- **Side Effects**:
    - Like all anticoagulants, the major side effect is **bleeding**. At least half of bleeding complications occur when the INR exceeds the therapeutic range. Bleeding can be mild (epistaxis, hematuria) or severe (retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal), including life-threatening intracranial bleeding.
    - **Management of bleeding**: To minimize risk, INR should be kept in range. For asymptomatic patients with INR 3.5–10, warfarin should be withheld. If INR >10, oral vitamin K (2.5–5 mg) can be given, though its effect on bleeding risk is unproven. Higher doses of oral vitamin K (5–10 mg) reverse INR faster but may cause temporary resistance upon restarting warfarin. Patients with serious bleeding need aggressive treatment: 5–10 mg vitamin K by slow IV infusion, supplemented with **four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate** (which normalizes INR faster than fresh frozen plasma).
    - **Skin Necrosis**: A rare complication, usually seen 2–5 days after therapy initiation. Characterized by well-demarcated erythematous lesions on thighs, buttocks, breasts, or toes, which become necrotic. Biopsies reveal microvascular thrombi.
        - Occurs in patients with **congenital or acquired deficiencies of protein C or protein S**. Warfarin initiates a precipitous fall in protein C/S levels, eliminating this anticoagulant pathway before it exerts its antithrombotic effect, leading to a procoagulant state and thrombosis.
        - Treatment involves discontinuing warfarin, reversal with vitamin K if needed, and administering an alternative anticoagulant (heparin or LMWH). Protein C concentrate or fresh-frozen plasma may accelerate healing. Skin grafting may be necessary.
        - Patients with known protein C or S deficiency require **overlapping treatment with a parenteral anticoagulant** when initiating warfarin; low doses of warfarin should be started, and the parenteral agent continued until INR is therapeutic for 2–3 consecutive days. Rivaroxaban or apixaban are alternative treatment options, though information on their efficacy and safety in severe protein C or S deficiency is limited.
    - **Pregnancy**: **Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy**, particularly in the first and third trimesters, as it crosses the placenta and can cause fetal abnormalities (e.g., characteristic embryopathy with nasal hypoplasia and stippled epiphyses, CNS abnormalities) or bleeding in the fetus (especially intracranial bleeding at delivery). Heparin, LMWH, or fondaparinux can be used during pregnancy instead.
    - **Breastfeeding**: Warfarin does not pass into breast milk and can be safely given to nursing mothers.
    - **Special Problems**:
        - **Lupus anticoagulant**: Patients with thrombosis complicating antiphospholipid antibody syndrome should target an **INR of 2.0–3.0**, as higher intensity regimens are not more effective and cause more bleeding. If the lupus anticoagulant prolongs baseline INR, **factor X levels can be used instead of INR** for monitoring.
        - **Periprocedural Management**:
            - Warfarin does not need to be stopped for low-risk bleeding procedures (e.g., dental cleaning, simple dental extraction, cataract surgery, skin biopsy).
            - For procedures with moderate or high bleeding risk, warfarin should be **stopped 5 days before**to allow INR to normalize.
            - High-risk thrombosis patients (e.g., mechanical heart valves) can be **bridged with once- or twice-daily SC LMWH** when INR falls below 2.0. The last LMWH dose should be given 12–24 hours before the procedure. Warfarin can be restarted after the procedure.

#### Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)

This class includes dabigatran (thrombin inhibitor) and rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban (factor Xa inhibitors).

- **Table 118-9: Comparison of the Pharmacologic Properties of the Direct Oral Anticoagulants**

|Property|Dabigatran|Rivaroxaban|Apixaban|Edoxaban|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|**Target**|Thrombin|Factor Xa|Factor Xa|Factor Xa|
|**Prodrug**|Yes|No|No|No|
|**Substrate for P-glycoprotein**|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic (minor)|Hepatic (CYP3A4/5, CYP2J2)|Hepatic (CYP3A4/5)|Hepatic (minor)|
|**Renal Excretion**|80%|33%|25%|50%|
|**Half-life**|12–14 hours|7–11 hours|12 hours|10–14 hours|

- **Indications**:
    - All four DOACs are licensed for **stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation**(patients without mechanical heart valves or severe rheumatic mitral valve disease).
    - All four are licensed for **treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE)**.
    - Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are licensed for **thromboprophylaxis after elective hip or knee arthroplasty** (edoxaban only in Japan).
    - Low-dose rivaroxaban is licensed for use **with aspirin for secondary prevention** in patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease.
- **Dosing**:
    - **Stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation**:
        - **Rivaroxaban**: **20 mg once daily** (15 mg once daily if creatinine clearance 15–49 mL/min). Must be administered with food to enhance absorption.
        - **Dabigatran**: **150 mg twice daily** (75 mg twice daily if creatinine clearance 15–30 mL/min). Administration with food may reduce dyspepsia.
        - **Apixaban**: **5 mg twice daily** (2.5 mg twice daily for patients with at least two of the “ABC” criteria: age >80 years, body weight <60 kg, and creatinine >1.5 mg/dL). Can be given with or without food.
        - **Edoxaban**: **60 mg once daily** (if creatinine clearance 50–95 mL/min); reduced to **30 mg once daily** if creatinine clearance 15–50 mL/min, body weight ≤60 kg, or using potent P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Can be given with or without food.
    - **Treatment of VTE**:
        - **Dabigatran and edoxaban** are started after patients receive at least a **5-day course of a parenteral anticoagulant** (e.g., LMWH). Dabigatran is 150 mg twice daily (if creatinine clearance >30 mL/min). Edoxaban dosage is identical to that for atrial fibrillation.
        - **Rivaroxaban and apixaban** can be given in **all-oral regimens**. Rivaroxaban is started at 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, then reduced to 20 mg once daily. Apixaban is started at 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, then reduced to 5 mg twice daily.
        - For **secondary VTE prevention**, apixaban can be lowered to 2.5 mg twice daily, and rivaroxaban to 10 mg once daily.
    - **Thromboprophylaxis after elective hip or knee replacement surgery**: Started after surgery, often for 30 days (hip) or 10–14 days (knee).
        - **Dabigatran**: **220 mg once daily**.
        - **Rivaroxaban**: **10 mg once daily**.
        - **Apixaban**: **2.5 mg twice daily**.
        - In lower risk patients, a 5-day course of rivaroxaban followed by a 30-day course of aspirin (81 mg daily) appears as effective and safe as extended rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis.
    - For **secondary prevention of adverse cardiac or limb events** in coronary or peripheral artery disease, rivaroxaban is given at **2.5 mg twice daily on top of aspirin** (81 or 100 mg once daily).
- **Monitoring**:
    - DOACs are designed for administration **without routine monitoring**.
    - Monitoring may be helpful for assessing adherence, detecting accumulation or overdose, identifying bleeding mechanisms, and determining activity before surgery or reversal.
    - For qualitative assessment: **PT can be used for factor Xa inhibitors** (rivaroxaban and edoxaban prolong PT more than apixaban). The **aPTT is used for dabigatran**. Anti–factor Xa assays are needed to assess apixaban activity due to its limited effect on PT.
    - Quantitative assays include chromogenic anti–factor Xa assays for factor Xa inhibitors and the diluted thrombin clotting time or ecarin clot time with appropriate calibrators for dabigatran.
- **Side Effects**:
    - Like all anticoagulants, **bleeding** is the most common side effect.
    - DOACs are associated with **less intracranial bleeding than warfarin**, but higher dose regimens of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban are associated with **more gastrointestinal bleeding**.
    - **Dyspepsia** occurs in up to 10% of dabigatran-treated patients (improves with time, minimized with food). It is rare with rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.
- **Periprocedural Management**:
    - DOACs must be **stopped before procedures with moderate or high bleeding risk** (held for 1–2 days, or longer if renal function is impaired).
    - Assessment of residual anticoagulant activity is prudent before high-bleeding-risk procedures.
- **Management of Bleeding**:
    - For minor bleeding, withholding one or two doses is usually sufficient.
    - For more serious bleeding, the approach is similar to warfarin management, except **vitamin K is not beneficial**. The anticoagulant and any antiplatelet drugs should be withheld, the patient resuscitated with fluids and blood products, and the bleeding site identified and managed.
    - Coagulation testing or DOAC level measurement determines anticoagulation extent, and renal function should be assessed. If the last dose was taken within 4 hours, oral activated charcoal may prevent absorption (especially in overdose). If >24 hours have passed, the DOAC is unlikely responsible for bleeding unless renal function is markedly impaired.
    - **Anticoagulant reversal** should be considered if bleeding continues despite supportive measures, or if it is life-threatening or occurs in a critical organ (e.g., intracranial) or closed space (e.g., pericardium, retroperitoneum).
    - **Idarucizumab**: Licensed for **dabigatran reversal** in such patients or those requiring urgent surgery/intervention. It is a humanized antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity to form an irreversible complex, cleared by the kidneys. Given as a **5-g IV bolus**, it rapidly reverses anticoagulant effects and normalizes aPTT, diluted thrombin time, or ecarin clot time.
    - **Andexanet alfa**: Available for reversal of **rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban**. It is a recombinant variant of factor Xa without catalytic activity, acting as a decoy to sequester oral factor Xa inhibitors.
        - **Low-dose regimen**: 400 mg bolus, then 4 mg/min infusion for up to 120 min. Used for rivaroxaban/apixaban doses of 10 mg or 5 mg or less, respectively, or any dose if the last dose was taken >8 hours prior.
        - **High-dose regimen**: 800 mg bolus, then 8 mg/min infusion for up to 120 min. Used to reverse rivaroxaban/apixaban doses over 10 mg and 5 mg, respectively, if the last dose was <8 hours prior, or if the dose/timing is unknown.
    - Andexanet alfa is expensive and not universally available, often reserved for life-threatening bleeds (intracranial hemorrhage, retroperitoneal/pericardial bleeds).
    - If andexanet is unavailable, **four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)** (25–50 units/kg) is also effective at restoring hemostasis. If bleeding continues, activated PCC (50 units/kg) or recombinant factor VIIa (90 μg/kg) can be considered.
    - Neither andexanet alfa nor four-factor PCC has been evaluated for reversal in patients needing urgent surgery/intervention. Andexanet alfa also reverses heparin and LMWH, which could be problematic in cardiac or vascular surgery. Most surgical procedures can be undertaken without reversal, with four-factor PCC given if necessary. For surgery to stop bleeding, upfront four-factor PCC administration can be considered.
- **Pregnancy**: **DOACs are contraindicated in pregnancy** because they are small molecules that pass through the placenta. Appropriate contraception is important for women of childbearing potential. DOACs should also be avoided in nursing mothers.

## FIBRINOLYTIC DRUGS

### Role of Fibrinolytic Therapy

Fibrinolytic drugs are used to **degrade thrombi**, administered systemically or via catheters directly into the thrombus.

- **Systemic delivery** is used for acute MI, acute ischemic stroke, and most cases of massive PE. The goal is **rapid thrombus dissolution** to restore blood flow. In the coronary circulation, this limits myocardial damage and reduces morbidity/mortality. In the cerebral circulation, it decreases neuronal death and brain infarction. For massive PE, it restores pulmonary artery perfusion.
- **Peripheral arterial thrombi** and thrombi in the **proximal deep veins of the leg** are most often treated using **catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy**. Catheters with multiple side holes can enhance drug delivery, and intravascular devices that fragment and extract thrombi can be used alone or with fibrinolytic drugs.

### Mechanism of Action

Currently approved fibrinolytic agents include streptokinase, acylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (anistreplase), urokinase, recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA, also known as alteplase or activase), and two recombinant derivatives of rtPA, tenecteplase and reteplase.

- All these agents act by converting **plasminogen** (the zymogen) to **plasmin** (the active enzyme). Plasmin then degrades the **fibrin matrix of thrombi** and produces soluble fibrin degradation products.
- **Endogenous fibrinolysis is regulated at two levels**:
    - **Plasminogen activator inhibitors**, particularly type 1 (PAI-1), regulate the activity of tPA and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), preventing excessive plasminogen activation.
    - **α2-antiplasmin** serves as the major inhibitor of plasmin.
    - The plasma concentration of plasminogen is twofold higher than α2-antiplasmin. With pharmacologic doses of plasminogen activators, the generated plasmin concentration can exceed α2-antiplasmin.
    - Unregulated plasmin can also degrade fibrinogen and other clotting factors, leading to a **systemic lytic state**, which reduces the hemostatic potential of the blood and increases bleeding risk.
- The endogenous fibrinolytic system localizes plasmin generation to the fibrin surface. Both plasminogen and tPA bind to fibrin to form a ternary complex, promoting efficient plasminogen activation. Plasmin generated on the fibrin surface is relatively protected from inactivation by α2-antiplasmin, promoting fibrin dissolution. C-terminal lysine residues exposed as plasmin degrades fibrin serve as binding sites for additional plasminogen and tPA, creating positive feedback.
- **Fibrin-specific plasminogen activators** preferentially activate fibrin-bound plasminogen (e.g., alteplase and its derivatives).
- **Nonspecific plasminogen activators** do not discriminate between fibrin-bound and circulating plasminogen, leading to activation of circulating plasminogen and a systemic lytic state (e.g., streptokinase, anistreplase, and urokinase).

### Streptokinase

Unlike other plasminogen activators, streptokinase is **not an enzyme** and does not directly convert plasminogen to plasmin.

- **Mechanism of Action**: It forms a **1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen**, inducing a conformational change in plasminogen that exposes its active site. This streptokinase-plasminogen complex then converts additional plasminogen to plasmin.
- Streptokinase has no affinity for fibrin, and its complex activates both free and fibrin-bound plasminogen. Activation of circulating plasminogen generates enough plasmin to overwhelm α2-antiplasmin, inducing a **systemic lytic state** that degrades fibrin in the thrombus but also fibrinogen.
- When given systemically to patients with acute MI, streptokinase reduces mortality (usually 1.5 million units IV infusion over 30–60 minutes).
- Patients can develop **antibodies** against streptokinase (or from prior streptococcal infection), which can reduce its effectiveness.
- **Side Effects**:
    - **Allergic reactions** occur in ~5% of patients (rash, fever, chills, rigors), with rare anaphylactic reactions.
    - **Transient hypotension** is common, attributed to plasmin-mediated release of bradykinin, usually responding to leg elevation, IV fluids, and low doses of vasopressors.

### Anistreplase

Anistreplase is generated by combining streptokinase with equimolar amounts of Lys-plasminogen. The active site is masked with an anisoyl group, which is slowly removed by deacylation after IV infusion, giving the complex a half-life of ~100 minutes and allowing for single bolus administration.

- It offers **few mechanistic advantages over streptokinase**; like streptokinase, it does not distinguish between fibrin-bound and circulating plasminogen, thus producing a **systemic lytic state**.
- Allergic reactions and hypotension are as frequent as with streptokinase.
- When compared with alteplase in acute MI, alteplase provided more rapid reperfusion, trending toward better clinical outcomes and reduced mortality. The high cost of anistreplase has dampened enthusiasm for its use.

### Urokinase

Urokinase is a two-chain serine protease derived from cultured fetal kidney cells, with a molecular weight of 34,000.

- It directly converts plasminogen to plasmin by cleaving the Arg560-Val561 bond.
- Unlike streptokinase, urokinase is **not immunogenic**, and allergic reactions are rare.
- It produces a **systemic lytic state** because it does not discriminate between fibrin-bound and circulating plasminogen.
- Despite many years of use, urokinase has never been systemically evaluated for coronary thrombolysis. It is often employed for **catheter-directed lysis of thrombi** in deep veins or peripheral arteries.
- Urokinase is **no longer available** due to production problems.

### Alteplase (rtPA, Activase)

Alteplase is a recombinant form of single-chain tPA with a molecular weight of 68,000. It is rapidly converted into its two-chain form by plasmin. Single- and two-chain forms have equivalent activity in the presence of fibrin, but single-chain tPA has tenfold lower activity without fibrin.

- Alteplase consists of five domains: finger (residues 4–50), epidermal growth factor (EGF, 50–87), first kringle (K1, 92–173), second kringle (K2, 180–261), and a protease domain (on the C-terminal B chain).
- Its interaction with fibrin is mediated primarily by the finger domain and, to a lesser extent, by the second kringle domain. Alteplase has considerably higher affinity for fibrin than fibrinogen. The catalytic efficiency of plasminogen activation by alteplase is two to three orders of magnitude higher in the presence of fibrin, which helps localize plasmin generation to the fibrin surface.
- Although it preferentially activates plasminogen in the presence of fibrin, alteplase is **not as fibrin-selective as first predicted**. (DD)E, the major soluble degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, binds alteplase and plasminogen with high affinity and stimulates plasminogen activation as potently as fibrin.
- Plasmin generated on circulating (DD)E degrades fibrinogen, leading to the accumulation of fragment X, which when incorporated into hemostatic plugs, makes them susceptible to lysis. This phenomenon may contribute to **alteplase-induced bleeding**.
- A trial comparing alteplase with streptokinase for acute MI showed significantly **lower mortality with alteplase**. The greatest benefit was observed in patients younger than 75 years with anterior MI who presented within 6 hours of symptom onset.
- **Dosing**: For acute MI or ischemic stroke, alteplase is given as an IV infusion over 60–90 minutes, with a total dose usually ranging from 90 to 100 mg.
- **Side Effects**: Allergic reactions and hypotension are **rare**, and alteplase is not immunogenic.

### Tenecteplase (TNK-tPA)

Tenecteplase is a genetically engineered variant of tPA designed for a **longer half-life** and **resistance to inactivation by PAI-1**.

- To prolong its half-life, a new glycosylation site was added to the first kringle domain, and an existing glycosylation site was removed (this reduced fibrin affinity).
- To confer resistance to PAI-1 inhibition, a tetra-alanine substitution was introduced at residues 296–299 in the protease domain.
- Tenecteplase is **more fibrin-specific than tPA**. While both bind to fibrin with similar affinity, tenecteplase has significantly lower affinity for (DD)E than tPA. This results in (DD)E stimulating systemic plasminogen activation by tenecteplase to a lesser extent than by tPA, leading to **less fibrinogen degradation** with tenecteplase.
- **Dosing**: For coronary thrombolysis, tenecteplase is given as a **single IVlacks the finger, epidermal growth factor, and first kringle domains**. It is a truncated derivative with a molecular weight of 39,000.
- It binds fibrin more weakly than tPA because it lacks the finger domain.
- Since it is produced in _Escherichia coli_, reteplase is not glycosylated, which gives it a **longer plasma half-life than tPA**.
- **Dosing**: Given as **two IV boluses, separated by 30 minutes**.
- Clinical trials have demonstrated that reteplase is at least as effective as streptokinase for acute MI, but it is **not superior to tPA**.

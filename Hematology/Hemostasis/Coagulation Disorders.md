# Introduction

- Deficiencies of coagulation factors have been recognized for centuries.
- Patients with genetic deficiencies of plasma coagulation factors exhibit lifelong recurrent bleeding episodes.
- Common inherited factor deficiencies are hemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (FIX deficiency), both X-linked diseases.
- Rare congenital bleeding disorders (FII, FV, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII, and fibrinogen deficiencies) are commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.
- Disease phenotype often correlates with the level of factor activity.
- FXII deficiency is not accompanied by a bleeding phenotype, despite prolonged aPTT.
- Advances in molecular basis have led to targeted therapeutic approaches, including small molecules, recombinant proteins, or cell- and gene-based therapies.

# Laboratory Assessment of Clotting Factor Deficiency

- The two most commonly used tests of hemostasis are prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

|Test Result|Suggested Deficiency|Source|
|---|---|---|
|Isolated prolonged PT|FVII deficiency||
|Prolonged aPTT|Intrinsic pathway factor deficiency, most commonly FVIII (hemophilia A), FIX (hemophilia B), or FXI deficiency||
|Prolonged PT and aPTT|FV, FX, FII, or fibrinogen abnormalities||

- A mixing study, adding normal pooled plasma to patient’s plasma, is the next step.
    - clotting time corrects --> coagulation factor deficiency + individual factor activity assays are performed to determine the deficient factor.
    - clotting time does not correct --> presence of an inhibitor (antibody to a specific factor) or anticoagulants

# Acquired Deficiencies of Plasma Coagulation Factors

- More frequent than congenital disorders.
- Most common disorders include hemorrhagic diathesis of liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and vitamin K deficiency.
- In these disorders, blood coagulation is hampered by deficiency of more than one clotting factor.
- Bleeding episodes result from perturbation of both primary (e.g., platelet and vessel wall interactions) and secondary (coagulation) hemostasis.

# Inhibitors

- Development of alloantibodies to coagulation plasma proteins, clinically termed inhibitors, is a relatively rare disease.
- Often affects **hemophilia A or B and FXI-deficient patients on repetitive exposure to the missing protein.**
- Inhibitory autoantibodies can occur in subjects without genetic deficiency, sometimes postpartum, as a manifestation of autoimmune/neoplastic disease, or idiopathically.
- Rare cases of acquired inhibitors to thrombin or FV reported in patients receiving topical bovine thrombin preparations.
- **Detection**: A mixing study that does not correct with the addition of normal plasma indicates the presence of an inhibitor.
- Additional tests are required to identify the specificity and measure the titer of the inhibitor.
- Inhibitor detection is particularly important in hemophilia, with yearly screening performed at most treatment centers.
- **Treatment**:
    - Requires replacement of the deficient protein(s) using recombinant or purified plasma-derived products or fresh-frozen plasma (FFP).
    - Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are plasma-derived factor concentrates initially used for hemophilia, but also for warfarin reversal due to containing vitamin K-dependent factors.
    - 3F-PCC is less frequently used for warfarin reversal due to low FVII levels, requiring FFP as a FVII source.
    - 4F-PCC (especially in the US) contains FII, FIX, FX, higher levels of FVII than 3F-PCC, and protein S and protein C.

# Hemophilia A and B

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Manifestations

- **Nature**: X-linked recessive hemorrhagic disease.
- **Cause**: Mutations in the F8 gene (hemophilia A/classic hemophilia) or F9 gene (hemophilia B).
- **Prevalence**: Affects 1 in 10,000 males worldwide; hemophilia A represents 80% of cases.
- **Genetics**:
    - The large F8 gene is more susceptible to mutation events.
    - Male subjects are clinically affected; women carriers are generally asymptomatic.
    - Family history is absent in ∼30% of cases; 80% of these mothers are carriers of de novo mutated allele.
    - Over 500 different mutations identified.
    - A common hemophilia A mutation is an inversion of the intron 22 sequence (40% of severe hemophilia A cases).
    - Molecular diagnosis permits precise mutation identification, allowing accurate diagnosis of women carriers.
- **Clinical Presentation**: Hemophilia A and B are clinically indistinguishable.
- **Disease Phenotype**: Correlates with FVIII or FIX activity.

|Classification|Factor Activity|
|---|---|
|Severe|<1%|
|Moderate|1–5%|
|Mild|6–30%|

- **Bleeding Characteristics**:
    - **Severe and moderate forms**: Bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis), soft tissues, and muscles after minor trauma or spontaneously.
    - **Mild disease**: Infrequent bleeding, usually secondary to trauma.
    - **Residual activity >25%**: Disease discovered only after major trauma or during routine preoperative laboratory tests, usually with isolated prolonged aPTT requiring mixing study.
- **Factor Half-life**:
    - FVIII has a short circulating half-life (25–30 min), extended to ∼12 h when complexed with von Willebrand factor (VWF).
    - VWD needs to be excluded in patients with prolonged aPTT and low FVIII activity without known hemophilia history.
- **Early life bleeding**: May present after circumcision or rarely as intracranial hemorrhages. More evident when children begin to walk or crawl.
- **Common severe form manifestations**: Recurrent hemarthroses, affecting knees, elbows, ankles, shoulders, and hips.
    - Acute hemarthroses are painful, with local swelling and erythema, leading to muscle contractures.
    - Chronic hemarthroses cause debilitating synovial thickening and synovitis.
    - Recurrent bleeding results in a "target joint," leading to progressive joint deformity, sometimes requiring surgery.
- **Hematomas**: Muscle hematomas in distal limbs can compress arteries, veins, or nerves, resulting in compartment syndrome.
- **Life-threatening Bleeding**: Into oropharyngeal spaces, central nervous system (CNS), or retroperitoneum requires immediate therapy.
    - Retroperitoneal hemorrhages can accumulate large blood quantities, forming masses (pseudotumor syndrome) with calcification and inflammatory tissue, and damage the femoral nerve.
    - Pseudotumors can also form in bones.
- **Hematuria**: Frequent, often self-limited, may not require specific therapy.

## Treatment

- Without treatment, severe hemophilia may limit life expectancy.
- **Historical Context**:
    - Post-WWII: Plasma used, but limited by required volumes.
    - 1960s: Discovery of FVIII-enriched cryoprecipitate and purification of FVIII/FIX led to home infusion therapy in the 1970s.
    - Factor concentrates dramatically improved life expectancy and quality of life.
    - Mid-1980s: Viral inactivation steps reduced risk of HIV and hepatitis.
    - 1990s: Production of recombinant FVIII and FIX further reduced risks.
    - Patients born after 1985 rarely contract hepatitis/HIV; life expectancy is ∼65 years. New infections not reported since 1998.
- **Factor Replacement**: Mainstay of therapy for half a century.
    - Provided either on-demand (in response to bleeding) or as prophylactic treatment.
    - **Primary Prophylaxis**: Maintaining missing clotting factor at levels ≥1% regularly to prevent bleeds, especially hemarthroses.
        - Hemophilic boys on regular infusions of FVIII (3 days/week) or FIX (2 days/week) can reach puberty without detectable joint abnormalities.
        - Prophylactic treatment has become more common (51% of children <6 years in 2005, up from 33% in 1995).
        - Standard care for children and adults with severe hemophilia.
        - Challenges: High cost, lifestyle factors (difficulty with peripheral vein access), potential infectious/thrombotic risks of long-term central vein catheters.
- **Treatment of Hemophilia Bleeds**:
    - Prompt initiation of factor replacement (symptoms often precede objective evidence).
    - Avoidance of antiplatelet drugs.
- **Dosing**:
    - Dosed in units (U): 1 U is amount of FVIII (100 ng/mL) or FIX (5 μg/mL) in 1 mL of normal plasma.
    - **FVIII**: 1 U/kg body weight increases plasma FVIII level by 2%. (e.g., 3500 U for 70-kg patient to reach 100%).
        - Half-life: 8–12 h, requiring twice-daily injections.
        - ![[hemophiliadosing.png]]
    - **FIX**: Doses differ as recovery is usually 50% of predicted.
        - Half-life: ∼24 h, allowing once-a-day injection.
        - ![[f9dosing.png]]
    - **Continuous infusion**: May be desirable after surgery for sustained factor levels at lower cost.
- **Cryoprecipitate**:
    - Enriched with FVIII protein bound to VWF (∼80 IU FVIII/bag).
    - Use only in emergencies when factor concentrates are not available due due to risk of bloodborne diseases. May be the only source of FVIII in developing countries.
- **Factor Level Targets for Bleeding Episodes**:
    - **Mild bleeds (uncomplicated hemarthroses/superficial hematomas)**: Initial factor level of 30–50%.
    - **Severe hemarthroses (especially "target joint")**: Additional doses to maintain 15–25% for 2 or 3 days.
    - **Large hematomas/deep muscle bleeds**: 50% or higher, possibly for 1 week+ if no clinical improvement.
    - **Serious bleeds (oropharyngeal spaces, CNS, retroperitoneum)**: Sustained protein levels of 50–100% for 7–10 days.
    - **Prophylactic replacement for surgery**: Aim for normal factor levels (100%) for 7–10 days, then taper.
    - **Oral surgery**: Factor replacement for 1–3 days coupled with oral antifibrinolytic drugs.

## Non-Transfusion Therapy in Hemophilia

- **DDAVP (1-Amino-8-D-Arginine Vasopressin)**:
    - Synthetic vasopressin analog causing transient rise in FVIII and VWF (not FIX) by release from vascular endothelial cells.
    - Patients with moderate or mild hemophilia A should be tested for response.
    - Dose: 0.3 μg/kg body weight over 20 min; expected to raise FVIII levels 2-3 fold over baseline, peaking 30-60 min after infusion.
    - Does not improve FVIII levels in severe hemophilia A patients (no stores to release).
    - Repeated dosing results in tachyphylaxis as storage pools deplete. Exogenous FVIII required after three consecutive doses if further therapy is indicated.
- **Antifibrinolytic Drugs**:
    - E.g., ε-amino caproic acid (EACA) or tranexamic acid.
    - Prevent fibrin degradation by plasmin.
    - Use for gum bleeding, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and oral surgery.
    - Duration: 1 week or longer.
    - Tranexamic acid dose: 25 mg/kg three to four times a day.
    - EACA dose: Loading dose of 200 mg/kg (max 10 g) followed by 100 mg/kg per dose (max 30 g/d) every 6 h.
    - Not indicated to control hematuria due to concern for forming an occlusive clot in the genitourinary tract.

## Complications

### Inhibitor Formation

- Major complication of hemophilia treatment: Formation of alloantibodies to FVIII or FIX.
- **Prevalence**:
    - FVIII inhibitors: ∼30% in severe hemophilia A, 10% in nonsevere hemophilia A.
    - FIX inhibitors: 3–5% of all hemophilia B patients.
- **High-risk group**: Severe deficiency (>80% of inhibitor cases), familial history of inhibitor, African descent, FVIII or FIX gene mutations resulting in large coding region deletion or gross gene rearrangements.
- **Onset**: Usually early in life (median 2 years of age), after 10 cumulative days of exposure.
- Intensive replacement therapy (major surgery, intracranial bleeding, trauma) increases inhibitor risk for all ages and severities, requiring close monitoring.
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Suspected when patients do not respond to factor replacement at therapeutic doses.
- **Impact**: Inhibitors increase both morbidity and mortality in hemophilia.
- **Detection**: Early detection critical; most hemophilia centers perform annual screening with aPTT and mixing studies.
    - **Bethesda assay**: Defines specificity and titer of inhibitor, expressed in Bethesda units (BU). 1 BU neutralizes 50% of FVIII or FIX in normal plasma after 2h incubation.
- **Patient Classification by Response**:
    - **Low responders**: Titer <5 BU.
    - **High responders**: Initial inhibitor titer >5 BU or an anamnestic response with increase to >5 BU.
- **Therapy Goals**: Control acute bleeding episodes and eradicate the inhibitor.
    - **Control of bleeding episodes**:
        - **Low responders**: Respond well to high doses of human FVIII (50–100 U/kg).
        - **High responders**: Do not respond to FVIII. Control achieved using "bypass agents" (activated PCCs [aPCCs] and recombinant activated factor VII [FVIIa]), which activate coagulation downstream or through a different pathway.
        - **FIX inhibitor patients**: High doses of FIX can be used (<5 BU), but allergic/anaphylactic reactions are common; bypass products preferred for treatment/prevention of bleeding and for high titer inhibitors.
    - **Eradication of inhibitory antibody**:
        - Immunosuppression alone is not effective.
        - **Immune tolerance induction (ITI)**: Most effective strategy, based on daily infusion of missing protein until inhibitor disappears (typically >1 year), with ∼60% success rates.
        - Management of ITI-resistant patients is challenging.
        - Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) combined with ITI reduces titers in some cases, but sustained eradication is uncommon.

### Other Therapeutic Approaches for Hemophilia A and B

- **Engineered clotting factors**: Developed with longer half-lives by fusion to polyethylene glycol (FVIII, FIX), IgG1-Fc (FVIII, FIX) or albumin (FIX).
    - Aim to facilitate prophylaxis by requiring fewer weekly injections to maintain circulating levels ≥1% (e.g., FVIII from 3 to 2 days/week, FIX once-a-week).
    - One is currently approved for use.
- **Novel approaches**: Manipulating coagulation cascade components by targeting natural anticoagulants and inhibitors of coagulation activation are in development.
- **Emicizumab**:
    - Asymmetric bispecific antibody.
    - One variable chain binds FIXa, the other binds FX, bringing them into close contact for FX activation by FIXa.
    - FXa subsequently cleaves prothrombin to thrombin, without FVIII.
    - Effective in patients with severe hemophilia A, with or without inhibitors.
    - Administration: Initial once-a-week subcutaneous injections for 4 weeks, then once-a-month dosing to prevent spontaneous bleeds.
    - Provides dramatic improvement in quality of life.
    - Breakthrough bleeds can occur and require careful management; a small number of patients with inhibitors treated with aPCC or recombinant FVIIa developed thrombotic events or fatal thrombotic microangiopathy.
- **Gene Therapy**:
    - X-linked disorders are ideally suited as small increases in plasma factor level result in significant clinical improvement.
    - **FIX**: Most studied due to smaller gene, easier viral vector packaging. One approach uses FIX Padua (gain of function mutation) for marked increase in specific activity.
    - **FVIII**: Larger FVIII gene successfully transferred via adeno-associated viral vector to some hemophilia A patients.
    - Early results appear promising.
    - Complications include transaminitis and loss of gene expression. No gene therapy approaches have regulatory approval yet.

## Infectious Diseases

- Hemophilia patients treated with clotting factor concentrates before the 1990s were almost universally infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV.
- These infections are major cause of morbidity and second leading cause of death in these patients.
- Co-infection of HCV and HIV (in almost 50% of patients) aggravates liver disease evolution, requiring correction of both genetic and acquired factor deficiencies.
- Improvements in HIV and HCV treatment altered devastating prognosis.
- In select cases with cirrhosis, liver transplant has been performed, which is also curative for hemophilia.

## Emerging Clinical Problems in Aging Hemophilia Patients

- Number of patients living with hemophilia into adulthood has increased due to treatment advances.
- Life expectancy: Severe hemophilia ∼10 years shorter than general male population; near normal in mild or moderate hemophilia.
- Older hemophilia population has distinct needs: More severe arthropathy, chronic pain, high rates of HCV and/or HIV infections.
- **Cardiovascular Disease**:
    - Mortality from coronary artery disease is lower due to hypocoagulability decreasing thrombus formation, but atherogenesis is not prevented.
    - Typical cardiovascular risk factors (age, obesity, smoking, physical inactivity, hypertension, chronic renal disease) are seen as in the general population.
    - Management of acute ischemic events and coronary revascularization requires collaboration among hematologists, cardiologists, and internists.
- **Cancer**:
    - HIV- and HCV-related malignancies are a concern.
    - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common cause of death in HIV-negative patients.
    - Cancer screening recommendations for the general population should apply to age-matched hemophilia patients, including routine HCC screening.
    - Screening for GU or GI tract neoplasms in patients with hematuria or hematochezia may be delayed.
- Hemophilia patients benefit from the same preventive and therapeutic approaches to minimize cardiovascular disease and malignancy risk as the general population.

## Management of Carriers of Hemophilia

- Women carriers of hemophilia with factor levels ∼50% of normal may not have an increased risk for bleeding.
- A wide range of factor activity (22–116%) due to random X chromosome inactivation (lyonization) can lead to unexpected bleeding in women with low levels.
- Factor level of carriers should be measured to optimize perioperative management.
- **Pregnancy**: FVIII levels increase approximately two- to threefold; FIX increase is less pronounced.
- **After delivery**: Rapid fall in pregnancy-induced clotting factor levels results in imminent bleeding risk.
    - Prevented by factor concentrate infusion to levels of 50–70% for 3 days for vaginal delivery and up to 5 days for cesarean delivery.
    - In mild cases, DDAVP and/or antifibrinolytic drugs are recommended.

# Factor XI Deficiency

## Characteristics and Clinical Manifestations

- Also known as hemophilia C.
- **Nature**: Rare autosomal bleeding disorder.
- **Frequency**: One in a million generally; highly prevalent among Ashkenazi and Iraqi Jewish populations (6% heterozygotes, 0.1–0.3% homozygotes).
- **Mutations**: More than 65 reported in the FXI gene; fewer (2-3) found among affected Jewish populations.
- **Clotting Activity**: Normal FXI levels range from 70–150 U/dL. Levels vary depending on heterozygous, homozygous, or double heterozygous mutations, with levels <1 U/dL in the latter two.
- **Bleeding Risk**: Patients with FXI levels <10% of normal have a high risk, but phenotype does not always correlate with FXI clotting activity.
- **Family History**: Informative, with bleeding risk based on kindreds.
- **Clinical Presentation**: Mucocutaneous hemorrhages common, especially following trauma.
    - Examples: Bruises, gum bleeding, epistaxis, hematuria, and menorrhagia.
    - Suggests tissues rich in fibrinolytic activity are more susceptible.
    - Postoperative bleeding is common but not always present, even among patients with very low FXI levels.

## Treatment

- FXI replacement is indicated in patients with severe disease for major surgical procedures.
- A negative history of bleeding complications following invasive procedures does not exclude increased hemorrhage risk.
- **Sources of FXI**: Limited to FFP in the United States; a plasma-derived FXI concentrate is available in other countries.
- **FFP Dosing**: 15–20 mL/kg to maintain trough levels 10–20%.
- **Frequency**: Can be given every other day in setting of bleeding or major surgery.
- **Half-life**: 40–70 h.
- **Antifibrinolytic drugs**: Can be used for minor bleeds and as adjunctive treatment with FXI replacement, with the exception of GU tract bleeding.
- **FXI Inhibitor**:
    - Development seen in 10% of severely FXI-deficient patients.
    - Not associated with spontaneous bleeding.
    - Bleeding with surgery or trauma can be severe.
    - Treatment: PCC/aPCC or recombinant activated FVII is effective.

# Rare Bleeding Disorders

## Overview

- Inherited disorders resulting from deficiencies of clotting factors other than FVIII, FIX, and FXI occur infrequently.
- **Bleeding Manifestations**: Vary.
    - Generally asymptomatic: Dysfibrinogenemia or FVII deficiency.
    - Life-threatening: FX or FXIII deficiency.
- **Hemarthroses**: Rare (in contrast to hemophilia).
- **Common Bleeding Sites**: Mucosal tract or after umbilical cord clamping.
- Individuals heterozygous for plasma coagulation deficiencies are often asymptomatic.
- **Diagnosis**: Laboratory assessment for the specific deficient factor following screening with general coagulation tests.

## Treatment

- Replacement therapy using FFP or PCCs provides adequate hemostasis for bleeds or prophylactic treatment.
- **Specific Concentrates**: Available for FX and fibrinogen.
- **FXIII Deficiency**: Requires Cryoprecipitate or FXIII concentrate.
- **FVII Deficiency**: Like FXI, has increased prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Best treated with rVIIa rather than FFP or PCCs depending on severity/type of surgery.

# Familial Multiple Coagulation Deficiencies

## Combined Deficiency of FV and FVIII

- Patients exhibit ∼5% residual clotting activity of each factor.
- Associated with a mild bleeding tendency, often following trauma.
- **Genetic Basis**:
    - Mutation in the _lectin mannose binding 1_ (_LMAN1_) gene, which encodes a mannose-binding protein in the Golgi apparatus functioning as a chaperone for FV and FVIII.
    - Mutations in the _multiple coagulation factor deficiency 2_ (_MCFD2_) gene, encoding a protein forming a Ca2+ dependent complex with LMAN1 providing cofactor activity in intracellular mobilization of FV and FVIII.
- **Replacement Therapy**:
    - FFP to maintain FV levels.
    - DDAVP or FVIII concentrate to achieve FVIII levels of 20–40%.
    - Alternatively, platelets (which contain FV) can be used.

## Multiple Deficiencies of Vitamin K–Dependent Coagulation Factors

- **Nature**: Combined deficiency of all vitamin K-dependent proteins (procoagulant proteins prothrombin (II), VII, IX, X and anticoagulant proteins C and S).
- **Cause**: Associated with defects in two enzymes involved in vitamin K metabolism.
- **Vitamin K Role**: Cofactor for carboxylation of gamma carbon of glutamic acid residues in vitamin K-dependent factors, critical for calcium and phospholipid binding.
- **Enzymes**: γ-glutamylcarboxylase and epoxide reductase are critical for metabolism and regeneration of vitamin K.
- **Genetic Defects**: Mutations in genes encoding γ-carboxylase (_GGCX_) or vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 (_VKORC1_) result in defective enzymes and reduced activity of vitamin K-dependent factors (1–30% of normal).
- **Clinical Manifestations**: Patients can have mild to severe bleeding episodes present from birth.
- **Treatment**:
    - Some patients respond to oral vitamin K1 (5–20 mg/d) or parenteral vitamin K1 (5–20 mg/week).
    - For severe bleeding, replacement therapy with PCC may be necessary.

# Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

## Definition and Causes

- **Definition (ISTH 2001)**: An acquired syndrome characterized by intravascular activation of coagulation with loss of localization arising from different causes that can originate from and cause damage to the microvasculature, potentially leading to organ dysfunction.
- ![[DICcauses.png]]
- **Common Clinical Causes**:
    - Bacterial sepsis (also viral and fungal sepsis).
    - Trauma.
    - Obstetric causes (abruptio placentae or amniotic fluid embolism).
    - Malignant disorders (especially mucin-producing adenocarcinomas and acute promyelocytic leukemia).
- **Thrombo-inflammation**: Activation of inflammatory pathways in response to infectious pathogens leads to increased tissue factor expression, neutrophil/monocyte activation, cytokine release, neutrophil extracellular traps, and polyphosphate release, causing thrombin generation.
- **Vascular Endothelial Cell Damage**: Leads to loss of native antithrombotic properties, especially with sepsis and trauma.
- **Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and Cytokine Storm**: Exuberant cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses (often with infection) associated with increased mortality and DIC.
- **Purpura Fulminans**: A severe form of DIC resulting in thrombosis of extensive skin areas.
    - Affects predominantly young children following viral or bacterial infection.
    - Especially those with inherited or acquired hypercoagulability due to deficiencies of protein C pathway components.
    - Neonates homozygous for protein C deficiency can develop neonatal purpura fulminans.

## Pathophysiology

- **Central Mechanism**: Uncontrolled generation of thrombin by multiple mechanisms.
- Simultaneous disruption of physiologic anticoagulant mechanisms and abnormal fibrinolysis further accelerate the process.
- These abnormalities contribute to systemic fibrin deposition in small and midsize vessels.
- **Consequences**:
    - Duration and intensity of fibrin deposition can compromise blood supply to organs (lung, kidney, liver, brain), causing organ failure (e.g., pulmonary microvascular thrombosis in ARDS).
    - Sustained activation of coagulation and fibrin formation consumes clotting factors and platelets, leading to systemic bleeding.
    - Secondary hyperfibrinolysis occurs in late stages of DIC, aggravating bleeding.

## Clinical Manifestations

- Related to the magnitude of hemostasis imbalance, underlying disease, or both.
- **Common Findings**: Petechiae, ecchymoses, and bleeding (from oozing at venipuncture sites to severe hemorrhage from GI tract, lung, or into CNS).
- **Chronic DIC**: Bleeding symptoms are discrete and restricted to skin or mucosal surfaces.
- **Hypercoagulability**: Manifests as occlusion of vessels in microcirculation and resulting organ failure.
    - Thrombosis of large vessels and cerebral embolism can also occur.
- **Hemodynamic Complications**: Shock common among patients with acute DIC due to underlying disease.
- **Mortality**: Ranges from 30 to >80%.

## Diagnosis

- Can be difficult.
- **ISTH Scoring Tool for Overt DIC**:
    - ![[DICdiagnosis.png]]
    - Developed and validated to aid diagnosis.
    - Incorporates platelet count, D-dimer level, prothrombin time (PT), and fibrinogen level.
    - Assigns points for different levels of each, with aggregate score helping diagnosis.
    - A separate tool exists for pregnant women.
    - The peripheral smear should be assessed for schistocytes.
    - Lab diagnosis should prompt a search for the underlying disease.
    - In critically ill patients, these tests should be repeated over 6–8 h due to rapid deterioration.

## Chronic DIC

- Low-grade, compensated DIC.
- Can occur in clinical situations including giant hemangioma, metastatic carcinoma, or dead fetus syndrome.
- **Lab Findings**:
    - Elevated plasma levels of FDP or D-dimers.
    - aPTT, PT, and fibrinogen values are within the normal range or high.
    - Mild thrombocytopenia or normal platelet counts are common.
    - Red cell fragmentation is often detected but at a lower degree than in acute DIC.

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Distinguishing between DIC and severe liver disease**: Challenging, requires serial measurements of DIC laboratory parameters.
    - **Severe Liver Disease Features**: Thrombocytopenia (platelet sequestration, portal hypertension, hypersplenism), decreased synthesis of coagulation factors and natural anticoagulants, and elevated D-dimer.
    - **Contrast**: In liver disease, these parameters do not change rapidly, unlike DIC.
- **Microangiopathic Disorders (e.g., acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura)**:
    - Present with acute onset accompanied by thrombocytopenia, red cell fragmentation, and multiorgan failure.
    - Clinical presentation and laboratory findings (e.g., inhibitor to ADAMTS13 levels) assist in diagnosis.

## Treatment

- Morbidity and mortality associated with DIC are primarily related to the underlying disease.
- Management of the underlying disease is required to control and eliminate DIC.
- Support with platelets and coagulation factors may be needed until the inciting cause is under control.
- Most patients with overt DIC are critically ill, requiring intensive care unit management for shock physiology and other manifestations.

### Management of Hemorrhagic Symptoms

- **Transfusion Support**: Required for active bleeding or high risk during invasive procedures or after chemotherapy.
    - Not indicated solely to correct mildly to moderately abnormal coagulation parameters.
- **Platelet Transfusion**: For platelet counts <10,000–20,000/μL.
- **Replacement of Fibrinogen and Coagulation Factors**:
    - With FFP, cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate (as a source of fibrinogen).
    - Amounts determined by degree of abnormal PT, aPTT, and fibrinogen levels, as well as bleeding severity or risk.
    - Fibrinogen level should be maintained at >150 mg/dL.
    - PT prolonged no more than 3 s above the upper limit of normal.
- **Vitamin K**: Should be given.
- Patients should be frequently monitored, and transfusion support adjusted.

### Replacement of Coagulation or Fibrinolysis Inhibitors

- Anticoagulants (heparin, antithrombin III [ATIII], thrombomodulin concentrates) and antifibrinolytic drugs have been tried.
- **Heparin**:
    - Low doses of continuous-infusion heparin (5–10 U/kg per h) may be effective in patients with low-grade DIC associated with solid tumors, acute promyelocytic leukemia, or recognized thrombosis.
    - Indicated for purpura fulminans, during surgical resection of giant hemangiomas, and during removal of a dead fetus.
    - In acute hemorrhagic DIC, heparin use is likely to aggravate bleeding.
    - In severe DIC, improved coagulation parameters with heparin but no survival benefit; professional society recommendations vary.
- **Serine Protease Inhibitor Concentrates (ATIII, thrombomodulin)**:
    - Demonstrated little efficacy in all treated sepsis patients.
    - Post hoc analyses of those with sepsis and confirmed DIC suggest a survival advantage and require further study.
- **Activated protein C**: Withdrawn from market for septic shock (clinical practice findings did not replicate trial results); impact on DIC not evaluated.
- **Antifibrinolytics**:
    - May be considered in patients with DIC characterized by a primary hyperfibrinolytic state with concomitant severe bleeding.
    - Concern for increasing thrombosis risk has led to consideration of concomitant heparin use.
    - Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia or chronic DIC associated with giant hemangiomas may benefit from this therapy.

# Vitamin K Deficiency

## Pathogenesis and Causes

- Vitamin K-dependent proteins include clotting factor proteins and proteins in bone, lung, kidney, and placenta.
- **Vitamin K Function**: Mediates posttranslational modification of glutamate residues to γ-carboxylglutamate, critical for activity of vitamin K-dependent proteins for calcium binding and proper assembly on phospholipid membranes.
- **Genetic Causes**: Inherited mutations with decreased functional activity of _GGCX_ or _VKORC1_ enzymes result in bleeding disorders.
- **Acquired Causes**:
    - Low dietary intake (rare in adults).
    - Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
    - Disease or surgical interventions affecting intestinal vitamin K absorption (anatomic alterations, changes in bile salts/pancreatic enzymes).
    - Chronic liver diseases (e.g., primary biliary cirrhosis) deplete vitamin K stores.
- **Neonatal Vitamin K Deficiency (hemorrhagic disease of the newborn)**: Almost entirely eliminated by routine vitamin K administration to all neonates.

## Clinical Manifestations

- **Lab Findings**: Prolongation of PT values is the most common and earliest finding due to short FVII half-life, occurring before aPTT prolongation.

## Treatment

- **Parenteral Vitamin K**: 10 mg is sufficient to restore normal clotting factor levels within 8–10 h.
- **Rapid Correction**: Requires replacement with FFP or PCC, choice depending on intravascular volume status and need for rapidity of correction.
- **Reversal of Warfarin (Vitamin K Antagonists)**:
    - **Excessive anticoagulation (asymptomatic)**: Minimal doses of vitamin K (1 mg orally or IV) can diminish bleeding risk while maintaining therapeutic anticoagulation.
    - **Emergent reversal (life-threatening bleeding or emergency surgery)**: Use of 4F-PPC is the standard of care.
- Re-initiation of anticoagulation needs careful consideration in patients with underlying vascular disease, vascular trauma, atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities to prevent thromboembolic complications.

# Coagulation Disorders Associated with Liver Failure

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Features

- The liver is the site of synthesis and clearance of most procoagulant and natural anticoagulant proteins and fibrinolytic system components.
- **Bleeding Risk**: High risk due to deficient synthesis of procoagulant factors and enhanced fibrinolysis (referred to as accelerated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis [AICF]).
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Common.
    - Causes: Decreased thrombopoietin, congestive splenomegaly (hypersplenism), or immune-mediated shortened platelet life span (primary biliary cirrhosis).
- Several anatomic abnormalities secondary to underlying liver disease further increase bleeding risk.
- **Dysfibrinogenemia**: Relatively common finding due to impaired fibrin polymerization.
- **DIC**: Development in patients with chronic liver disease is not uncommon and may enhance bleeding risk.
- **Laboratory Evaluation**: Mandatory for optimal therapeutic strategy (controlling ongoing bleeding or pre-invasive procedures).
    - **Typical Presentation**: Prolonged PT, aPTT, and TT (depending on liver damage degree), thrombocytopenia, and normal or slight increase in D-dimer.
    - **Fibrinogen Levels**: Low only in fulminant hepatitis, decompensated cirrhosis, advanced liver disease, or with DIC.
    - **Prolonged TT + Normal Fibrinogen/D-dimer**: Suggests dysfibrinogenemia.
    - **FVIII Levels**: Often normal or elevated; decreased levels suggest superimposed DIC.
    - **FV Levels**: Only synthesized in the hepatocyte and not vitamin K-dependent; reduced levels may indicate liver failure.
    - **Normal FV + Low FVII**: Suggests vitamin K deficiency.
- **Vitamin K Levels**: May be reduced due to compromised storage, changes in bile acids, or cholestasis (diminishing absorption).
    - IV vitamin K may improve hemostasis.

## Treatment

- Treatment of bleeding with FFP was standard, but 4F-PCC is now favored.
    - **4F-PCC advantages**: Lower volume, less increase in portal pressure, reduced risk of circulatory overload and other FFP complications.
- Treatment should not be given simply to correct laboratory abnormalities in a patient not bleeding or without need for invasive procedures.
- **Platelet Concentrates**: Indicated when platelet counts are <10,000–20,000/μL to control bleeding or immediately before an invasive procedure if counts are <50,000/μL.
- **Cryoprecipitate**: Indicated only when fibrinogen levels are <100–150 mg/mL, unless the patient is bleeding (then higher target).
- **Antifibrinolytic drugs**: As adjuncts to control bleeding, not thought to increase thrombosis risk; impact on acute thrombosis propagation not well studied.

## Liver Disease and Thromboembolism

- Bleeding in patients with stable liver disease is often mild or even asymptomatic.
- As disease progresses, hemostatic balance is precarious and easily disturbed by comorbid complications (e.g., infections, renal failure).
- **Hypercoagulability**: Despite past assumptions based on abnormal coagulation tests, multiple factors contribute to hypercoagulability.
    - Factors: Decreased natural anticoagulant proteins S and C, endothelial cell changes, hemodynamic changes resulting in stasis.
    - Portal vein thrombosis is common.
    - Patients can also develop deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
    - Patients with cirrhosis appear to have a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in venous thromboembolism (VTE) rate.
- **Anticoagulation**:
    - Compensated cirrhosis patients do not appear to have increased bleeding with VTE prophylaxis or therapeutic dose heparin for acute portal vein thrombosis when carefully managed.
    - In outpatient setting, warfarin is avoided, but low-molecular-weight heparin and direct oral anticoagulants have been safely used to treat thrombosis.

# Acquired Inhibitors of Coagulation Factors

## Pathogenesis and Clinical Manifestations

- **Nature**: Immune-mediated disease characterized by the presence of an autoantibody against a specific clotting factor.
- **Underlying Conditions**: Almost half of patients have an underlying autoimmune or immunoproliferative disorder, malignancy, or are peripartum.
- **Most Common Target**: FVIII (sometimes referred to as acquired hemophilia A).
- **Other Inhibitors Reported**: Prothrombin (FII), FV, FIX, FX, and FXI.
- **Acquired FVIII Inhibitor**:
    - Occurs predominantly in older adults (median age 60 years).
    - Occasionally in pregnant or postpartum women with no previous bleeding history.
- **Bleeding Episodes**:
    - Commonly in soft tissues, gastrointestinal or urinary tracts, and skin.
    - **Hemarthrosis is rare (in contrast to hemophilia).**
    - Retroperitoneal hemorrhages and other life-threatening bleeding may appear suddenly.
- **Mortality**: 8–22% in untreated patients; most deaths occur within the first few weeks after presentation.

## Diagnosis

- Based on prolonged aPTT with normal PT and TT.
- A mixing study that does not correct with normal pooled plasma.
- The Bethesda assay (using factor specific-deficient plasma) confirms the diagnosis.

## Treatment

- **Goals**: Control of bleeding and eradication of the inhibitor.
- Many patients can have life-threatening bleeding.
- **Control of Bleeding**: Requires use of activated "bypass products" such as aPCC or recombinant FVIIa.
- Recombinant porcine FVIII can be effective for acquired inhibitors of FVIII.
- Emicizumab use to treat acquired FVIII inhibitors has been reported, with trials underway in this population in Europe.
- **Eradication of Inhibitor**:
    - Unlike hemophilia, inhibitors in nonhemophilic patients are typically responsive to immune suppression. Therapy should be initiated early in most cases.
    - **High-dose intravenous γ-globulin and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody** are reported effective for FVIII autoantibodies.
    - No firm evidence confirms superiority of these alternatives over **first-line immunosuppressive drugs (glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide),** which are effective in 70% of patients.
    - Relapse of FVIII inhibitor is relatively common (up to 20%) within the first 6 months following immunosuppression withdrawal; patients should be followed regularly.

### Antibodies to Topical Thrombin Preparations

- **Use**: Topical plasma-derived bovine and human thrombin commonly used in major surgeries (cardiovascular, thoracic, neurologic, pelvic) and in trauma patients with extensive burns.
- **Antibody Formation**:
    - To xenoantigen or its contaminant (bovine clotting protein).
    - Potential to cross-react with human clotting factors, particularly FV and thrombin.
    - Can result in life-threatening bleeding.
    - Antibodies to FV also reported with recombinant human thrombin topical preparations.
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Rare, often complicated by bleeding detectable during or immediately following major surgery, which could be assumed due to the procedure itself.
- **Risk Factor**: Increased by repeated exposure to topical thrombin preparations.
    - Careful medical history of previous surgical interventions (even decades earlier) is critical.
- **Laboratory Abnormalities**:
    - Combined prolongation of aPTT and PT that often fails to improve by transfusion of FFP and vitamin K.
    - Mixing study that does not correct with normal pooled plasma.
    - Specificity of the antibody determined by measuring residual activity of human FV or other suspected human clotting factor.
    - No commercial assays specific for bovine thrombin coagulopathy.
- **Treatment**: No established guidelines.
    - Platelet transfusions used as a source of FV replacement for patients with FV inhibitors.
    - FFP and vitamin K supplementation may function as co-adjuvants rather than effective treatments.
    - Experience with recombinant FVIIa as a bypass agent is limited, with generally poor outcomes.
    - Specific treatments to eradicate antibodies (immunosuppression with glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or serial plasmapheresis) have been sporadically reported.
- **Patient Advice**: Avoid any topical thrombin sealant in the future.

### Lupus Anticoagulant

- Can be associated with venous or arterial thrombotic disease.
- **Bleeding**: Reported rarely due to antibodies to prothrombin, resulting in hypoprothrombinemia.
- **Laboratory Findings**:
    - Both lupus anticoagulant and acquired inhibitors show a prolonged aPTT that does not correct on mixing.
- **Differentiation from Acquired Inhibitors**:
    - The dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) and the hexagonal-phase phospholipids test will be negative in patients with an acquired inhibitor and positive in patients with lupus anticoagulants.
    - Lupus anticoagulant interferes with the clotting activity of many factors (FVIII, FIX, FXI, FXII), which can be assessed in the clinical laboratory. Acquired inhibitors are specific to a single factor.

# Hemostasis

- Dynamic process where the platelet and the blood vessel wall play key roles.
- Platelets are activated upon adhesion to von Willebrand factor (VWF) and collagen in the exposed subendothelium after injury.
- Platelet activation is also mediated through shear forces imposed by blood flow, particularly in diseased vessel walls.
- Platelet activation is also affected by the inflammatory state of the endothelium.
- The activated platelet surface provides the major physiologic site for coagulation factor activation.
    - This results in further platelet activation and fibrin formation.
- Genetic and acquired influences on the platelet, vessel wall, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems determine whether normal hemostasis, bleeding, or clotting symptoms will result.

# THE PLATELET

- Released from the megakaryocyte, likely under the influence of flow in the capillary sinuses.
- Normal blood platelet count is 150,000–450,000/μL.
- Major regulator of platelet production is the hormone thrombopoietin (TPO).
    - TPO is synthesized in the liver and other organs.
    - Synthesis is increased with inflammation, specifically by interleukin 6.
    - TPO binds to its receptor on platelets and megakaryocytes, by which it is removed from the circulation.
    - A reduction in platelet and megakaryocyte mass increases the level of TPO, which then stimulates platelet production.
- Platelets circulate with an average life span of 7–10 days.
- Approximately one-third of the platelets reside in the spleen, and this number increases in proportion to splenic size.
    - The platelet count rarely decreases to <40,000/μL as the spleen enlarges.
- Platelets are physiologically very active, but are anucleate, limiting their capacity to synthesize new proteins.
- Normal vascular endothelium contributes to preventing thrombosis by inhibiting platelet function.
- When vascular endothelium is injured, these inhibitory effects are overcome.
    - Platelets adhere to the exposed intimal surface primarily through VWF.
        - VWF is a large multimeric protein present in both plasma and in the extracellular matrix of the subendothelial vessel wall.
    - Platelet adhesion results in intracellular signals that lead to activation of the platelet glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa (αIIbβ3) receptor.
    - This results in platelet aggregation.
- Activated platelets undergo release of their granule contents.
    - Contents include nucleotides, adhesive proteins, growth factors, and procoagulants.
    - These serve to promote platelet aggregation and blood clot formation, and influence the environment of the forming clot.
- During platelet aggregation, additional platelets are recruited to the site of injury, leading to the formation of an occlusive platelet thrombus.
- The platelet plug is stabilized by the fibrin mesh that develops simultaneously as the product of the coagulation cascade.

# THE VESSEL WALL

- Endothelial cells line the surface of the entire circulatory tree, totaling 1–6 × 10^13 cells.
    - This is enough to cover a surface area equivalent to about six tennis courts.
- The endothelium is physiologically active, controlling:
    - Vascular permeability.
    - Flow of biologically active molecules and nutrients.
    - Blood cell interactions with the vessel wall.
    - The inflammatory response.
    - Angiogenesis.
- The endothelium normally presents an antithrombotic surface.
    - However, it rapidly becomes prothrombotic when stimulated.
    - This promotes coagulation, inhibits fibrinolysis, and activates platelets.
- In many cases, endothelium-derived vasodilators are also platelet inhibitors (e.g., nitric oxide).
- Conversely, endothelium-derived vasoconstrictors (e.g., endothelin) can also be platelet activators.
- **The net effect of vasodilation and inhibition of platelet function is to promote blood fluidity.**
- **The net effect of vasoconstriction and platelet activation is to promote thrombosis.**
- Thus, blood fluidity and hemostasis are regulated by the balance of antithrombotic/prothrombotic and vasodilatory/vasoconstrictor properties of endothelial cells.

# DISORDERS OF PLATELETS

## THROMBOCYTOPENIA

- Results from one or more of three processes:
    1. Decreased bone marrow production.
    2. Sequestration, usually in an enlarged spleen.
    3. Increased platelet destruction.
- Disorders of production may be either inherited or acquired.
- In evaluating a patient, a key step is to review the peripheral blood smear and first rule out “pseudothrombocytopenia”.
    - Pseudothrombocytopenia (Fig. 115-1B) is an in vitro artifact.
    - It results from platelet agglutination via antibodies (usually IgG, but also IgM and IgA).
    - This occurs when calcium content is decreased by blood collection in ethylenediamine tetraacetic (EDTA), the anticoagulant present in tubes used for complete blood counts (CBCs).
    - If a low platelet count is obtained in EDTA-anticoagulated blood, a blood smear should be evaluated.
    - A **platelet count should be determined in blood collected into sodium citrate or heparin.**
    - Alternatively, a smear of freshly obtained unanticoagulated blood, such as from a finger stick, can be examined.

### Approach to the Patient: Thrombocytopenia

- The history and physical examination, CBC results, and peripheral blood smear review are all critical components in the initial evaluation.
- The patient's overall health and whether they are receiving drug treatment will influence the differential diagnosis.
- A healthy young adult with thrombocytopenia will have a much more limited differential diagnosis than an ill hospitalized patient receiving multiple medications.
- Except in unusual inherited disorders, decreased platelet production usually results from bone marrow disorders that also affect red blood cell (RBC) and/or white blood cell (WBC) production.
- Because myelodysplasia can present with isolated thrombocytopenia, the **bone marrow should be examined in patients presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia who are older than 60 years or who do not respond to initial therapy.**
- While inherited thrombocytopenia is rare, any prior platelet counts should be retrieved and a family history regarding thrombocytopenia obtained.
- A careful history of drug ingestion, including nonprescription and herbal remedies, should be obtained, as drugs are the most common cause of thrombocytopenia.
- The physical examination can document an enlarged spleen, evidence of chronic liver disease, and other underlying disorders.
- Mild to moderate splenomegaly may be difficult to appreciate in many individuals but can be easily assessed by abdominal ultrasound.
- A platelet count of approximately 5000–10,000/μL is required to maintain vascular integrity in the microcirculation.
- When the count is markedly decreased:
    - Petechiae first appear in areas of increased venous pressure, such **as the ankles and feet in an ambulatory patient.**
    - **Petechiae are pinpoint, nonblanching hemorrhages and are usually a sign of a decreased platelet number and not platelet dysfunction.**
    - **Wet purpura (blood blisters that form on the oral mucosa) are thought to denote an increased risk of life-threatening hemorrhage.**
    - **Excessive bruising is seen in disorders of both platelet number and function.**

### Infection-Induced Thrombocytopenia

- Many viral and bacterial infections result in thrombocytopenia.
- This is the most common noniatrogenic cause of thrombocytopenia.
- This may or may not be associated with laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
    - DIC is most commonly seen in patients with systemic infections with gram-negative bacteria and in patients ill with COVID-19.
- Infections can affect both platelet production and platelet survival.
- Immune mechanisms can be at work, as in infectious mononucleosis and early HIV infection.
- Late in HIV infection, pancytopenia and decreased and dysplastic platelet production are more common.
- Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia in children usually follows a viral infection and almost always resolves spontaneously.
- This association of infection with immune thrombocytopenic purpura is less clear in adults.

### Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia

- Many drugs have been associated with thrombocytopenia.
- A predictable decrease in platelet count occurs after treatment with many chemotherapeutic drugs due to bone marrow suppression.
- Drugs that cause isolated thrombocytopenia and have been confirmed with positive laboratory testing are listed in Table 115-1.
    - All drugs should be suspect in a patient with thrombocytopenia without an apparent cause and should be stopped, or substituted, if possible.
- Herbal and over-the-counter preparations may also result in thrombocytopenia and should be discontinued in patients who are thrombocytopenic.
- **Classic drug-dependent antibodies** are antibodies that **react with specific platelet surface antigens and result in thrombocytopenia only when the drug is present.**
    - Many drugs are capable of inducing these antibodies, but they are more common with **quinine and sulfonamides.**
    - Drug-dependent antibody binding can be demonstrated by laboratory assays, showing antibody binding in the presence of, but not without, the drug present in the assay.
    - The thrombocytopenia typically occurs after a period of initial exposure (**median length 21 days),** or upon reexposure.
    - It usually **resolves in 7–10 days after drug withdrawal.**
- The thrombocytopenia caused by platelet Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitory drugs, such as abciximab, differs in that it may occur within 24 hours of initial exposure.
    - This appears to be due to the presence of naturally occurring antibodies that cross-react with the drug bound to the platelet.

### Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)

- Drug-induced thrombocytopenia due to heparin differs from that seen with other drugs in two major ways:
    1. The thrombocytopenia is not usually severe, with nadir counts rarely <20,000/μL.
    2. HIT is not associated with bleeding and, in fact, **markedly increases the risk of thrombosis.**
- The pathogenesis of HIT is complex.
    - It results from antibody formation to a complex of the platelet-specific protein platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin or other glycosaminoglycans.
    - The anti-heparin/PF4 antibody can activate platelets through the FcγRIIa receptor and also activate monocytes, endothelial cells, and coagulation proteins.
- Many patients exposed to heparin develop antibodies to heparin/PF4 but do not appear to have adverse consequences.
- A fraction of those who develop antibodies will develop HIT, and a portion of those (up to 50%) will develop thrombosis (HITT).
- HIT can occur after exposure to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as well as unfractionated heparin (UFH), although it is more common with UFH.
- Most patients develop HIT after exposure to heparin for 5–14 days.
- It occurs **before 5 days in those who were exposed to heparin in the prior few weeks or months (<∼100 days)** and have circulating anti-heparin/PF4 antibodies.
- Rarely, thrombocytopenia and thrombosis begin **several days after all heparin has been stopped (termed delayed-onset HIT).**
- More rarely, spontaneous HIT, or autoimmune HIT syndrome, occurs where there is no history of heparin exposure and is termed **vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT).**
    - A syndrome similar to spontaneous HIT has been described rarely post-COVID-19 vaccination, mainly with the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine.
- The “4T’s” have been recommended for use in a diagnostic algorithm for HIT:
    - Thrombocytopenia.
    - Timing of platelet count drop.
    - Thrombosis and other sequelae (such as localized skin reactions).
    - Other causes of thrombocytopenia not evident.
- Application of the 4T scoring system is very useful in excluding a diagnosis of HIT.
    - However, it will result in overdiagnosis of HIT in situations where thrombocytopenia and thrombosis due to other etiologies are common, such as in the intensive care unit.
- Alternative scoring systems have been recommended, including for patients after cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### LABORATORY TESTING FOR HIT

- Because of the prevalence of antiheparin antibodies without clinical disease, testing should be done only in individuals who are at intermediate or high risk based on clinical pretest assessment.
- HIT (anti-heparin/PF4) antibodies can be detected using two types of assays:
    1. **Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) with PF4/polyanion complex as the antigen:**
        - Most widely available.
        - Has a low specificity for the diagnosis of HIT because many patients develop antibodies but do not develop clinical HIT.
        - This is especially true in patients who have undergone surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, where approximately 50% of patients develop these antibodies postoperatively.
        - IgG-specific ELISAs increase specificity but may decrease sensitivity.
    2. **Platelet activation assay (most commonly the serotonin release assay):**
        - Measures the ability of the patient’s serum to activate platelets in the presence of heparin in a concentration-dependent manner.
        - This test has lower sensitivity but higher specificity than the ELISA.
- HIT remains a clinical diagnosis.

#### TREATMENT: Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia

- Early recognition is key in treatment of HIT.
- Prompt discontinuation of heparin and use of alternative anticoagulants if bleeding risk does not outweigh thrombotic risk.
- Thrombosis is a common complication of HIT, even after heparin discontinuation, and can occur in both the venous and arterial systems.
- In patients diagnosed with HIT, imaging studies to **evaluate for thrombosis (at least lower extremity duplex Doppler imaging) are recommended.**
- Patients requiring anticoagulation should be switched from heparin to an alternative anticoagulant.
    - The direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) **argatroban** is effective in HITT.
    - The DTI bivalirudin and the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide fondaparinux are also effective but not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication.
    - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are being used for treatment, although they are not FDA approved for this indication; studies in small numbers of patients suggest their use may be a viable option.
- HIT antibodies cross-react with LMWH, and these drugs should not be used in the treatment of HIT.
- Because of the high rate of thrombosis, anticoagulation should be considered, even in the absence of thrombosis.
- In patients with thrombosis, anticoagulation is continued for 3–6 months.
- In patients without thrombosis, the duration of anticoagulation is less well defined.
    - An increased risk of thrombosis is present for at least 1 month after diagnosis.
    - Most thromboses occur early, and whether thrombosis occurs later if the patient is initially anticoagulated is unknown.
    - Options include continuing anticoagulation until a few days after platelet recovery or for 1 month.
- Introduction of warfarin alone in the setting of HIT or HITT may precipitate thrombosis, particularly venous gangrene.
    - This is presumably due to clotting activation and severely reduced levels of proteins C and S.
    - Warfarin therapy, if started, should be overlapped with a DTI or fondaparinux.
    - It should be started after resolution of the thrombocytopenia and lessening of the prothrombotic state.
- Evidence for use of an oral direct Xa inhibitor in this setting is growing.
- The rare VITT syndrome is characterized by high D-dimer levels and thrombosis in unusual sites like the cerebral venous sinuses.
    - It is fatal in about 20% of cases.
    - Treatment is usually IgIV (intravenous immunoglobulin) to block platelet activation through Fc receptors, which is the pathogenic effect of the anti-PF4-polyanion antibody.

## Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)

- Acquired disorder in which there is immune-mediated destruction of platelets and possibly inhibition of platelet release from the megakaryocyte.
- In children, it is usually an acute disease, most commonly following an infection, and with a self-limited course.
- In adults, it is a more chronic disease, although in some adults, spontaneous remission occurs, usually within months of diagnosis.
- ITP is termed secondary if it is associated with an underlying disorder.
    - Autoimmune disorders (particularly systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE) and infections (such as HIV and hepatitis C) are common causes.
	- The association of ITP with _Helicobacter pylori_ infection is unclear but appears to have a geographic distribution.
- ITP is characterized by mucocutaneous bleeding and a low, often very low, platelet count.
- Patients usually present either with ecchymoses and petechiae or with thrombocytopenia incidentally found on a routine CBC.
- Otherwise normal peripheral blood cells and smear are present.
- Mucocutaneous bleeding, such as oral mucosa, gastrointestinal, or heavy menstrual bleeding, may be present.
- Rarely, life-threatening bleeding, including central nervous system bleeding, can occur.
- Wet purpura (blood blisters in the mouth) and retinal hemorrhages may herald life-threatening bleeding.

### LABORATORY TESTING IN ITP

- Laboratory testing for antibodies (serologic testing) is usually not helpful due to the low sensitivity and specificity of current tests.
- Bone marrow examination can be reserved for those who have other signs or laboratory abnormalities not explained by ITP or in patients who do not respond to initial therapy.
- The peripheral blood smear may show large platelets, with otherwise normal morphology.
- Depending on the bleeding history, iron-deficiency anemia may be present.
- Laboratory testing is performed to evaluate for secondary causes of ITP and should include:
    - Testing for HIV infection and hepatitis C (and other infections if indicated).
    - Serologic testing for SLE.
    - Serum protein electrophoresis, immunoglobulin levels (to potentially detect hypogammaglobulinemia).
    - Selective testing for IgA deficiency or monoclonal gammopathies.
    - Testing for _H. pylori_ infection (depending on clinical circumstance).
	- If anemia is present, direct antiglobulin testing (Coombs’ test) should be performed to rule out combined autoimmune hemolytic anemia with ITP (Evans’ syndrome).

### TREATMENT: Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura

- The treatment of ITP uses drugs that:
    - Decrease reticuloendothelial uptake of the antibody-bound platelet.
    - Decrease antibody production.
    - And/or increase platelet production.
- The diagnosis of ITP does not necessarily mean that treatment must be instituted.
- Patients with platelet counts >30,000/μL appear not to have increased mortality related to the thrombocytopenia.
- Initial treatment for patients without significant bleeding symptoms, severe thrombocytopenia (<5000/μL), or **signs of impending bleeding (e.g., retinal hemorrhage or large oral mucosal hemorrhages)** can be instituted as an outpatient using single agents.
    - Traditionally, this has been prednisone at 1 mg/kg or a 4-day course of dexamethasone, 40 mg/d.
    - Rh0(D) immune globulin therapy (WinRho SDF), at 50–75 μg/kg, is also being used.
        - Must be used only in Rh-positive patients.
        - Mechanism of action: production of limited hemolysis, with antibody-coated cells “saturating” the Fc receptors, inhibiting Fc receptor function.
        - Monitoring patients for 8 hours after infusion is advised by the FDA due to the rare complication of severe intravascular hemolysis.
    - Intravenous gamma globulin (IVIgG) is pooled, primarily IgG antibodies.
        - Also blocks the Fc receptor system, but appears to work primarily through different mechanism(s).
        - Has more efficacy than anti-Rh0(D) in postsplenectomized patients.
        - Dosed at 1–2 g/kg total, given over 1–5 days.
        - Side effects are usually related to the volume of infusion and infrequently include aseptic meningitis and renal failure.
        - All immunoglobulin preparations are derived from human plasma and undergo treatment for viral inactivation.
- For patients with severe ITP and/or symptoms of bleeding, hospital admission is required.
    - Combined-modality therapy is given using high-dose glucocorticoids with IVIgG or anti-Rh0(D) therapy.
    - Additional immunosuppressive agents may be used as needed.
- Rituximab, an anti-CD20 (B cell) antibody, has shown efficacy in the treatment of refractory ITP.
    - Long-lasting remission only occurs in approximately 30% of patients.
- TPO receptor agonists (romiplostim administered subcutaneously, eltrombopag orally) are effective in raising platelet counts.
    - Recommended for patients who relapse or who are unresponsive to at least one other therapy.
- Other immunosuppressive drugs have also been tested.
    - The combination of glucocorticoids with mycophenolate mofetil (500 mg PO bid, increasing to 1000 mg PO bid as tolerated) appears to be more effective than glucocorticoids alone.
- Splenectomy has been used for treatment of patients who relapse after glucocorticoids are tapered and remains a treatment option.
    - With the recognition that ITP will resolve spontaneously in some adult patients, observation (if platelet count is high enough), or intermittent treatment with anti-Rh0(D) or IVIgG, or initiation of treatment with a TPO receptor agonist may be a reasonable approach to see if ITP will resolve, prior to splenectomy or other therapies.
- Vaccination against encapsulated organisms (especially pneumococcus, but also meningococcus and _Haemophilus influenzae_, depending on patient age and potential exposure) is recommended before splenectomy.
- Accessory spleens are a very rare cause of relapse.

## Inherited Thrombocytopenia

- Thrombocytopenia is rarely inherited, either as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome.
- It may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked pattern.
- Many forms of autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia are now known to be associated with variants in the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain MYH9 gene.
    - These include the May-Hegglin anomaly, and Sebastian, Epstein’s, and Fechtner syndromes.
    - All have distinct distinguishing features.
    - A common feature of these disorders is large platelets (Fig. 115-1C).
- Autosomal recessive disorders include congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenia with absent radii, and Bernard-Soulier syndrome.
    - Bernard-Soulier syndrome is primarily a functional platelet disorder due to absence of Gp Ib-IX-V, the VWF adhesion receptor.
- X-linked disorders include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and a dyshematopoietic syndrome resulting from a mutation in GATA-1, an important transcriptional regulator of hematopoiesis.

## THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA AND HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME

- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic microangiopathies are a group of disorders characterized by:
    - Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) defined by thrombocytopenia and fragmented RBCs (Fig. 115-1D) on peripheral blood smear.
    - Laboratory evidence of hemolysis (elevated lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] and unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin).
    - Microvascular thrombosis.
- They include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).
- They also include syndromes complicating bone marrow transplantation, certain medications and infections, pregnancy, and vasculitis.
- In DIC, although thrombocytopenia and microangiopathy are seen, a coagulopathy predominates.
    - This involves consumption of clotting factors and fibrinogen, resulting in an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and often activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
- The PT and aPTT are characteristically normal in TTP or HUS.

### Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

- TTP was first described in 1924 by Eli Moschcowitz.
- It was characterized by a pentad of findings: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, neurologic findings, and fever.
    - The full-blown syndrome is less commonly seen now, probably due to earlier diagnosis.
- The introduction of treatment with plasma exchange markedly improved the prognosis in patients, with a decrease in mortality from 85–100% to 10–30%.
- The pathogenesis of inherited (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome) and idiopathic TTP (ITTP) is related to a deficiency of, or antibodies to, the metalloprotease ADAMTS13, which cleaves VWF.
- VWF is normally secreted as ultra-large multimers, which are then cleaved by ADAMTS13.
- The persistence of ultra-large VWF molecules is thought to contribute to pathogenic platelet adhesion and aggregation (Fig. 115-4).
- This defect alone, however, is not sufficient to result in TTP, as individuals with a congenital absence of ADAMTS13 develop TTP only episodically, including during first pregnancy.
- The level of ADAMTS13 activity, as well as antibodies to ADAMTS13, can be detected by laboratory assays.
    - These assays play a critical role in the differential diagnosis of MAHA.
    - ADAMTS13 activity levels of <10% are diagnostic of TTP.
- Idiopathic TTP appears to be more common in women than in men.
- No geographic or racial distribution has been defined.
- TTP is more common in patients with HIV infection and in pregnant women.
- Medication-related MAHA may be secondary to antibody formation (ticlopidine and possibly clopidogrel) or direct endothelial toxicity (cyclosporine, mitomycin C, tacrolimus, quinine).
    - Withdrawal, or reduction in dose, of endothelial toxic agents usually decreases the microangiopathy.

#### TREATMENT: Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

- TTP is a devastating disease if not diagnosed and treated promptly.
- In patients presenting with new thrombocytopenia (with or without evidence of renal insufficiency and other elements of classic TTP), laboratory data should be obtained to rule out DIC and to evaluate for evidence of MAHA.
    - Relevant tests include PT, aPTT, CBC with platelet count and peripheral smear, ADAMTS13 activity, LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin, direct antiglobulin assay.
- Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) remains the mainstay of treatment of TTP.
    - TPE is continued until the platelet count is normal and signs of hemolysis are resolved for at least 2 days.
- Although never evaluated in clinical trials, the use of glucocorticoids seems a reasonable approach but should only be used as an adjunct to plasma exchange.
- The addition of rituximab to initial therapy decreases duration of TPE and relapses.
- Caplacizumab, an anti-VWF nanobody, decreases mortality and burden of care when used in patients with ADAMTS13 <10% or with high clinical probability of disease.
- Guidelines from the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis recommend starting caplacizumab and rituximab only in individuals with diagnostic ADAMTS13 levels (usually <10%).
    - For rituximab, also recommended in patients with evidence of an inhibitor, given potential side effects and costs.
- Patients with persistently low ADAMTS13 have a greater risk of ongoing sequelae, including stroke.
- There is a significant relapse rate:
    - In patients treated with TPE, 25–45% relapse within 30 days of initial “remission”.
    - 12–40% of patients have late relapses.
- Relapses are more frequent in patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency at presentation.
- Treatment of patients with TTP relapses should be initiated before confirmatory laboratory assays are available.

## Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS)

- HUS is a syndrome characterized by acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
- It is seen preceded by an episode of diarrhea, often hemorrhagic in nature, predominantly in children.
    - _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 is the most frequent, although not only, etiologic serotype.
- HUS not associated with diarrhea is more heterogeneous in presentation and course.
- Atypical HUS (aHUS) is usually due to genetic defects in complement genes or antibodies directed against complementary regulatory proteins that result in chronic complement activation.
    - Laboratory testing for DNA variants in complement regulatory genes is available, although assigning pathogenicity to variants remains challenging.
    - Currently, a commercially available functional assay is not available that is diagnostic of the disease.

### TREATMENT: Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome

- Treatment of HUS is primarily supportive.
- In HUS associated with diarrhea, many (~40%) children require at least some period of support with dialysis.
    - However, the overall mortality is <5%.
- In HUS not associated with diarrhea, the mortality is higher, approximately 26%.
- Plasma infusion or plasma exchange has not been shown to alter the overall course in HUS or aHUS, except in patients with antibodies to factor H.
- ADAMTS13 levels are generally reported to be normal in HUS, although occasionally they have been reported to be decreased.
- In patients with aHUS, eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against C5 that blocks terminal complement, has efficacy in resolution of aHUS and improving or preserving renal function.
- Patients with aHUS may initially be treated with plasma exchange until the ADAMTS13 level is returned and the diagnosis is more clear, since aHUS remains a diagnosis of exclusion.
    - However, plasma exchange has not been shown to affect clinical outcomes in aHUS.

# THROMBOCYTOSIS

- Thrombocytosis is almost always due to one or more of the following:
    1. Iron deficiency.
    2. Inflammation, cancer, or infection (reactive thrombocytosis).
    3. An underlying myeloproliferative process (essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera).
    4. Rarely, the 5q– myelodysplastic process.
- Patients presenting with an elevated platelet count should be evaluated for underlying inflammation and malignancy, and iron deficiency should be ruled out.
- Thrombocytosis in response to acute or chronic inflammation has not been clearly associated with an increased thrombotic risk.
- Patients with markedly elevated platelet counts (>1.5 million), usually seen in the setting of a myeloproliferative disorder, have an increased risk of bleeding.
    - This appears to be due, at least in part, to acquired von Willebrand disease (VWD) due to platelet-VWF binding and removal from the circulation.

# QUALITATIVE DISORDERS OF PLATELET FUNCTION

## Inherited Disorders of Platelet Function

- Inherited platelet function disorders are thought to be relatively rare.
    - The prevalence of mild disorders is unclear, partly because testing for such disorders is suboptimal.
- Rare qualitative disorders include:
    - **Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia:** autosomal recessive, characterized by absence of the platelet Gp IIb/IIIa receptor.
    - **Bernard-Soulier syndrome:** autosomal recessive, characterized by absence of the platelet Gp Ib-IX-V receptor (the VWF adhesion receptor).
    - Both present with bleeding symptoms in childhood.
- **Platelet storage pool disorder (SPD):** the classic autosomal dominant qualitative platelet disorder.
    - This results from abnormalities of platelet granule formation.
    - It is also seen as a part of inherited disorders of granule formation, such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.
    - Bleeding symptoms in SPD are variable but often are mild.
- The most common inherited disorders of platelet function prevent normal secretion of granule content and are termed secretion defects.
    - An increasing number of genetic variants are being found in patients with these disorders, although assigning pathogenicity remains challenging.

## TREATMENT: Inherited Disorders of Platelet Dysfunction

- Bleeding symptoms or prevention of bleeding in patients with severe platelet dysfunction frequently requires platelet transfusion.
    - Care must be taken to limit the risk of alloimmunization by limiting exposure and using HLA-matched single donor platelets for transfusion when needed.
- rFVIIa (recombinant factor VIIa) is FDA approved in Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia and Bernard Soulier syndrome.
    - Its use can avoid platelet alloimmunization and anti-receptor antibody formation.
- Platelet disorders associated with milder bleeding symptoms frequently respond to desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin [DDAVP]).
    - DDAVP increases plasma VWF and factor VIII levels.
    - It may also have a direct effect on platelet function.
- Particularly for mucosal bleeding symptoms, antifibrinolytic therapy (tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid) is used.
    - Used alone or in conjunction with DDAVP or platelet therapy.

## Acquired Disorders of Platelet Function

- Acquired platelet dysfunction is common, usually due to medications.
    - Either intentionally (as with antiplatelet therapy) or unintentionally (as with high-dose penicillins).
- Acquired platelet dysfunction occurs in uremia.
    - This is likely multifactorial, but the resultant effect is defective adhesion and activation.
    - The platelet defect is improved most by dialysis.
    - It may also be improved by increasing the hematocrit to 27–32%, giving DDAVP (0.3 μg/kg), or use of conjugated estrogens.
- Platelet dysfunction also occurs with cardiopulmonary bypass due to the effect of the artificial circuit on platelets.
    - Bleeding symptoms respond to platelet transfusion.
- Platelet dysfunction seen with underlying hematologic disorders can result from nonspecific interference by circulating paraproteins or intrinsic platelet defects in myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes.

## VON WILLEBRAND DISEASE (VWD)

- VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder.
    - Prevalence of symptomatic disease is 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 individuals.
- VWF serves two roles:
    1. As the major adhesion molecule that tethers the platelet to the exposed subendothelium.
        - The platelet-adhesive function of VWF is critically dependent on the presence of large VWF multimers.
    2. As the binding protein for factor VIII (FVIII), resulting in significant prolongation of the FVIII half-life in circulation.
        - FVIII binding is not dependent on large VWF multimers.
- Most of the symptoms of VWD are “platelet-like”.
    - However, in more severe VWD, the FVIII is low enough to produce symptoms similar to those found in FVIII deficiency (hemophilia A).
- VWD has been classified into three major types, with four subtypes of type 2 (Table 115-2).
- **Type 1 VWD:**
    - By far the most common type, accounting for at least 80% of cases.
    - Features a parallel decrease in VWF protein, VWF function, and FVIII levels.
    - Patients have predominantly mucosal bleeding symptoms, although postoperative bleeding can also be seen.
    - Bleeding symptoms are uncommon in infancy and usually manifest later in childhood with excessive bruising and epistaxis.
        - The clinician should particularly note bruising at sites unlikely to be traumatized and/or prolonged epistaxis requiring medical attention.
    - Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common manifestation.
        - Menstrual bleeding resulting in anemia should warrant an evaluation for VWD and, if negative, functional platelet disorders.
    - Type 1 VWD may first manifest with dental extractions, particularly wisdom tooth extraction, or tonsillectomy.
- Not all patients with low VWF levels have bleeding symptoms.
- Whether patients bleed or not will depend on the overall hemostatic balance they have inherited, along with environmental influences and the type of hemostatic challenges they experience.
- Although VWD inheritance is autosomal, many factors modulate both VWF levels and bleeding symptoms.
    - These include blood type (patients with type O blood have VWF protein levels of approximately one-half those of patients with AB blood type).
        - The normal range for patients with type O blood overlaps that which has been considered diagnostic for VWD.
    - Other factors include thyroid hormone status, race, stress, exercise, hormonal (both endogenous and exogenous) influences, and modulators of VWF clearance.
- Patients with mildly decreased VWF levels should be diagnosed with VWD only in the setting of bleeding symptoms and/or a family history of VWD.
- **Type 2 VWD:** Patients have functional defects.
    - The VWF antigen measurement is significantly higher than the test of function.
    - For types 2A, 2B, and 2M VWD, platelet-binding and/or collagen-binding VWF activity is decreased.
    - **Type 2A VWD:** Impaired function is due either to increased susceptibility to cleavage by ADAMTS13 (resulting in loss of intermediate- and high-molecular-weight multimers) or to decreased production of these multimers by the cell.
    - **Type 2B VWD:** Results from gain-of-function DNA variants.
        - These result in increased ADAMTS13 cleavage and binding of VWF to platelets in circulation.
        - Subsequent clearance of this complex by the reticuloendothelial system occurs.
        - The resulting VWF in the patients’ plasma lacks the highest molecular-weight multimers.
        - The platelet count is usually modestly reduced.
    - **Type 2M VWD:** Occurs as a consequence of a group of DNA variants that cause dysfunction but do not affect multimer structure.
- **Type 2N VWD:** Due to variants in the VWF gene that affect binding of FVIII.
    - As FVIII is stabilized by binding to VWF, the FVIII in patients with type 2N VWD has a very short half-life.
    - The FVIII level is markedly decreased.
    - This is sometimes termed autosomal hemophilia.
- **Type 3 VWD (severe VWD):** Describes patients with virtually no VWF protein and usually FVIII levels <10%.
    - Patients experience mucosal and joint bleeding, surgery-related bleeding, and other bleeding symptoms.
    - Some patients with type 3 VWD, particularly those with large VWF gene deletions, are at risk of developing antibodies to infused VWF.
- **Acquired VWD or von Willebrand syndrome:**
    - Most commonly seen in patients with underlying lymphoproliferative disorders, including monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma, and Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia.
    - Seen most commonly in the setting of MGUS and should be suspected in patients (particularly elderly) with a new onset of severe mucosal bleeding symptoms.
    - Laboratory evidence of acquired VWD is found in some patients with cardiac valvular disease.
    - Heyde’s syndrome (aortic stenosis with gastrointestinal bleeding) is attributed to the presence of angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with aortic stenosis.
        - The shear stress on blood passing through the stenotic aortic valve appears to unfold VWF, making it susceptible to proteolysis.
        - Consequently, large multimer forms are lost, leading to an acquired type 2 VWD, but they return when the stenotic valve is replaced.

### TREATMENT: Von Willebrand Disease

- The mainstay of treatment for type 1 VWD is DDAVP (desmopressin).
    - DDAVP results in release of VWF and FVIII from endothelial stores.
    - Can be given intravenously, by high-concentration intranasal spray (1.5 mg/mL), or by subcutaneous injection (when a concentrated form is available).
    - Peak activity: ~30 min when given intravenously, whereas it is 2 hours when given intranasally.
    - Usual dose: 0.3 μg/kg intravenously or two squirts (one in each nostril) for patients >50 kg (one squirt for those <50 kg).
    - It is recommended that patients with VWD be tested with DDAVP to assess their response before using it.
    - In patients who respond well (increase in laboratory values of two- to fourfold), it can be used for procedures with minor to moderate risk of bleeding.
    - Depending on the procedure, additional doses may be needed; it is usually given every 12–24 hours.
    - Less frequent dosing may result in less tachyphylaxis, which occurs when synthesis cannot compensate for the released stores.
    - Major side effect of DDAVP is hyponatremia due to decreased free water clearance.
        - This occurs most commonly in the very young and the very old.
        - Fluid restriction should be advised for all patients for the 24 hours following each dose.
- Some patients with types 2A VWD respond to DDAVP such that it can be used for minor procedures.
- For the other subtypes, for type 3 disease, and for major procedures requiring longer periods of normal hemostasis, VWF replacement can be given.
    - Virally inactivated VWF-plasma-derived and recombinant factor concentrates are safer than cryoprecipitate as the replacement product.
- Antifibrinolytic therapy using either tranexamic acid (TXA) or ε-aminocaproic acid is an important therapy.
    - Used alone or in an adjunctive capacity, particularly for the prevention or treatment of mucosal bleeding.
    - These agents are particularly useful in treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (TXA 1300 mg every 8h) and postpartum hemorrhage.
    - Also used as prophylaxis for dental procedures, and with DDAVP or factor concentrate for dental extractions, tonsillectomies, and prostate procedures.
    - Antifibrinolytic agents are contraindicated in the setting of upper urinary tract bleeding due to the risk of ureteral obstruction.

# DISORDERS OF THE VESSEL WALL

- The vessel wall is an integral part of hemostasis.
    - Separation of a fluid phase is artificial, particularly in disorders such as TTP or HIT that clearly involve the endothelium as well.
- Inflammation localized to the vessel wall (such as vasculitis) and inherited connective tissue disorders are abnormalities inherent to the vessel wall.

## Metabolic and Inflammatory Disorders

- Acute febrile illnesses may result in vascular damage.
    - This can result from immune complexes containing viral antigens or the viruses themselves.
    - Certain pathogens, such as the rickettsiae causing Rocky Mountain spotted fever, replicate in endothelial cells and damage them.
    - SARS-CoV-2 also infects endothelial cells, resulting in activation and damage contributing to COVID-19 pathogenicity.
- Vascular purpura may occur in patients with polyclonal gammopathies.
    - More commonly occurs in those with monoclonal gammopathies, including Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, and cryoglobulinemia.
    - Patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia develop a more extensive maculopapular rash due to immune complex–mediated damage to the vessel wall.
- Patients with scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) develop painful episodes of perifollicular skin bleeding as well as more systemic bleeding symptoms.
    - Vitamin C is needed to synthesize hydroxyproline, an essential constituent of collagen.
- Patients with Cushing’s syndrome or on chronic glucocorticoid therapy develop skin bleeding and easy bruising due to atrophy of supporting connective tissue.
- A similar phenomenon is seen with aging, where following minor trauma, blood spreads superficially under the epidermis.
    - This has been termed senile purpura.
    - It is most common on skin that has been previously damaged by sun exposure.
- Henoch-Schönlein, or anaphylactoid, purpura is a distinct, self-limited type of vasculitis that occurs in children and young adults.
    - Patients have an acute inflammatory reaction with IgA and complement components in capillaries, mesangial tissues, and small arterioles.
    - Leading to increased vascular permeability and localized hemorrhage.
    - The syndrome is often preceded by an upper respiratory infection (commonly with streptococcal pharyngitis) or is triggered by drug or food allergies.
    - Patients develop a purpuric rash on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs.
    - This is usually accompanied by polyarthralgias or arthritis, abdominal pain, and hematuria from focal glomerulonephritis.
    - All coagulation tests are normal.
    - Renal impairment may occur.
    - Glucocorticoids can provide symptomatic relief but do not alter the course of the illness.

## Inherited Disorders of the Vessel Wall

- Patients with inherited disorders of the connective tissue matrix, such as Marfan’s syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, frequently report easy bruising.
- Inherited vascular abnormalities can result in increased bleeding.
    - This is notably seen in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, or Osler-Weber-Rendu disease).
        - A disorder where abnormal telangiectatic capillaries result in frequent bleeding episodes, primarily from the nose and gastrointestinal tract.
        - Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the lung, brain, and liver may also occur in HHT.
        - The telangiectasia can often be visualized on the oral and nasal mucosa.
        - Signs and symptoms develop over time.
        - Epistaxis begins, on average, at the age of 12 and occurs in >95% of affected individuals by middle age.
        - Approximately 25% have gastrointestinal bleeding, usually beginning after the age of 50.
        - HHT is caused by pathogenic DNA variants in a number of genes involved in the TGFβ/BMP signaling cascade.

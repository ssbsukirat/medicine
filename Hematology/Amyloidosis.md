# General Principles of Amyloidosis

- **Definition and Characteristics**
    - Amyloidosis is a group of **protein misfolding disorders**.
    - Characterized by the **extracellular deposition of insoluble polymeric protein fibrils** in tissues and organs.
    - A robust cellular machinery exists to chaperone and eliminate misfolded proteins, but factors like genetic mutation or incorrect processing may lead to misfolding and aggregation.
    - Many diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer’s disease) involve protein misfolding.
    - In amyloidoses, aggregates are typically extracellular.
    - Misfolded protein subunits assume a common **antiparallel, β-pleated sheet–rich structural conformation**, leading to higher-order oligomers and fibrils.
    - The term "amyloid" was coined around 1854 by Rudolf Virchow, who thought deposits resembled starch.
- **Classification**
    - Amyloid diseases are classified by the **biochemical nature of the protein** composing the fibril deposits.
    - Further classified by: systemic or localized, acquired or inherited, and clinical patterns.
    - Standard nomenclature is **AX**, where A indicates amyloidosis and X represents the protein present in the fibril.
    - This chapter primarily focuses on systemic forms.

|Amyloid Type|Precursor Protein (X)|Associated Conditions/Characteristics|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**AL**|Immunoglobulin Light Chains (LCs)|Arises from a clonal B-cell or plasma cell disorder; can be associated with myeloma or lymphoma.|
|**ATTR**|Transthyretin (TTR)|Most prevalent familial amyloidosis; derived from wild-type or mutated TTR; transport protein for thyroid hormone and retinol-binding protein.|
|**AA**|Serum Amyloid A (SAA)|Acute-phase reactant protein; occurs in settings of chronic inflammatory or infectious diseases; formerly known as secondary amyloidosis.|
|**Aβ2M**|β2-microglobulin|Results from misfolded β2-microglobulin; occurs in individuals with long-standing renal disease on dialysis.|
|**Aβ**|Amyloid precursor protein (APP) polypeptides|Most common form of localized amyloidosis; found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.|

- **Diagnosis**
    - ![[amyloiddiagnosis.png]]
    - Diagnosis and treatment rely on **histopathologic identification of amyloid deposits** and immunohistochemical, biochemical, or genetic determination of amyloid type.
    - In systemic amyloidoses, clinically involved organs can be biopsied, but deposits may be found in any tissue.
    - **Abdominal fat aspiration** is the most easily accessible tissue for biopsy, positive in >80% of systemic amyloidosis patients. Fat globules are stained for amyloid to avoid surgical procedures.
    - If abdominal fat is negative, more invasive biopsies (kidney, heart, liver, tongue, GI tract) can be considered.
    - Amyloid deposits stained with **Congo red dye** exhibit a unique "**apple green**" birefringence under polarized light microscopy. Other protein structures appear white.
    - **Electron microscopy** can visualize 10-nm-diameter fibrils in paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue.
    - Once amyloid is found, the precursor protein type must be determined by **immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy**, or **extraction and biochemical analysis employing mass spectrometry**.
    - **Gene sequencing** is used to identify mutants causing hereditary amyloidosis.
    - Clinical presentation (age, ethnic origin, organ involvement, underlying diseases, family history) provides clues, but **accurate typing is essential** due to considerable overlap in presentations.
    - **Clinical suspicion** should be raised by unexplained nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, enteropathy, arthropathy, and macroglossia.
- **Mechanisms of Fibril Formation and Tissue Toxicity**
    - The "amyloid hypothesis" proposes that precursor proteins undergo reversible unfolding or misfolding.
    - Misfolded proteins form oligomeric aggregates, higher-order polymers, and then fibrils that deposit in tissues.
    - **Accumulating evidence suggests that oligomeric intermediates may constitute the most toxic species**.
    - Oligomers are more capable than large fibrils of interacting with cells and inducing reactive oxygen species and stress signaling.
    - Fibrillar tissue deposits likely interfere with normal organ function.
- **Routine Laboratory Tests and Biomarkers**
    - Routine lab tests show relatively **nonspecific alterations**.
    - Blood counts are usually normal; erythrocyte sedimentation rate is frequently elevated.
    - Glomerular kidney involvement: **proteinuria** (often nephrotic range), leading to **hypoalbuminemia** (can be severe, <2 g/dL causes pedal edema or anasarca).
    - Amyloid cardiomyopathy: concentric ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction associated with elevation of **brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP**as well as **troponin**.
        - These cardiac biomarkers are used for disease staging, prognostication, and monitoring in AL amyloidosis. Renal insufficiency can falsely elevate these levels.
        - Biomarkers of cardiac remodeling (matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) are altered in amyloid cardiomyopathy serum.
    - Liver involvement: usually cholestasis with elevated alkaline phosphatase, minimal alteration of aminotransferases, and preserved synthetic function.
    - AL amyloidosis endocrine organs: hypothyroidism, hypoadrenalism, or hypopituitarism can occur.
    - **Abnormalities in multiple organ systems should raise suspicion** of amyloidosis.

# AL Amyloidosis

- **Etiology and Incidence**
    - Most frequently caused by a **clonal expansion of bone marrow plasma cells** that secrete a monoclonal immunoglobulin Light Chain (LC) depositing as amyloid fibrils.
    - Can occur with multiple myeloma or other B lymphoproliferative diseases (e.g., non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia).
    - **Most common type of systemic amyloidosis diagnosed in North America**.
    - Estimated incidence: 4.5 cases/100,000 population; true incidence may be higher.
    - Usually occurs **after age 40** and is often progressive and fatal if untreated.
- **Pathology and Clinical Features**
    - Amyloid deposits are usually **widespread** in AL amyloidosis, present in the interstitium of any organ outside the central nervous system.
    - Fibril deposits are composed of full-length 23-kDa monoclonal immunoglobulin LCs and fragments.
    - Accessory molecules co-deposited include serum amyloid P component, apolipoproteins e and A-IV, glycosaminoglycans, and metal ions.
    - Lambda subtypes of LCs predominate, with lambda 6 having unique structural properties predisposing to fibril formation, often in the kidney.
    - Often a **rapidly progressive disease** with a pleiotropic set of clinical syndromes.
    - Nonspecific symptoms: fatigue and weight loss.
    - **Key Organ Involvement and Signs:**
        - **Kidneys**: Most frequently involved (70–80% of patients). Manifests as proteinuria (often nephrotic range), hypoalbuminemia, secondary hypercholesterolemia/hypertriglyceridemia, and edema or anasarca. Interstitial deposition can cause azotemia without proteinuria.
        - **Heart**: Second most commonly affected organ (50–60% of patients) and the **leading cause of death**. ECG may show low voltage with a pseudo-infarct pattern. Echocardiography shows concentrically thickened ventricles and diastolic dysfunction. Poor atrial contractility increases risk for atrial thrombi and stroke. Cardiac MRI shows increased wall thickness and characteristic delayed subendocardial enhancement.
        - **Nervous System**: Peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy and/or autonomic dysfunction. Symptoms include GI motility disturbances (early satiety, diarrhea, constipation), dry eyes and mouth, impotence, orthostatic hypotension, and/or neurogenic bladder.
        - **Macroglossia**: A **pathognomonic sign**, seen in ~10% of patients.
        - Liver: Causes cholestasis and hepatomegaly.
        - Spleen: Frequently involved; functional hyposplenism may occur without significant splenomegaly.
        - **"Easy bruising"**: Due to amyloid deposits in capillaries or clotting factor X deficiency. Cutaneous ecchymoses, particularly around the eyes, produce the "**raccoon-eye**" sign (uncommon but pathognomonic).
        - Other findings: Nail dystrophy, alopecia, amyloid arthropathy with thickening of synovial membranes.
    - Presence of multisystemic illness or general fatigue with any of these syndromes should prompt a workup.
- **Diagnosis**
    - Key to diagnosis: identification of an **underlying clonal plasma cell or B lymphoproliferative process** and a **clonal LC**.
    - Serum protein electrophoresis and urine protein electrophoresis are not useful screening tests for AL amyloidosis.
    - More than 90% of patients have serum or urine monoclonal LC or whole immunoglobulin detectable by **immunofixation electrophoresis of serum (SIFE) or urine (UIFE)**, or by **nephelometric measurement of serum "free" LCs**.
        - Examining the ratio and absolute amount of serum-free LCs is essential, as renal insufficiency reduces LC clearance.
    - An increased percentage of plasma cells (5–30% of nucleated cells) is found in ~90% of patients' bone marrow.
    - **Kappa or lambda clonality** should be demonstrated by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or in situ hybridization for LC mRNA.
    - A monoclonal serum protein alone is not diagnostic, as monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) is common in older patients.
    - However, if MGUS is found with biopsy-proven amyloidosis, AL type should be ruled out.
    - Patients with "smoldering myeloma" and signs of renal, cardiac, or neurologic disease should be screened for AL amyloidosis.
    - **Accurate tissue amyloid typing is essential for appropriate treatment**.
        - Immunohistochemical staining is useful if selective, but some AL deposits bind nonspecifically.
        - **Immunoelectron microscopy is more reliable**.
        - **Laser capture microdissection and tandem mass spectrometry–based typing** of the amyloid precursor protein has become the diagnostic standard.
        - In ambiguous cases, other forms of amyloidosis should be thoroughly excluded.
- **Staging System and Risk Stratification**
    - Current staging systems for systemic AL amyloidosis are based on biomarkers of plasma cell dyscrasia, cardiac, and renal involvement.
    - The **Mayo 2004 cardiac staging system** is widely used, based on NT-proBNP and cardiac troponins. It was modified by European investigators for very-high-risk patients.
    - The **Mayo 2012 modification** includes clonal burden (assessed by dFLC – difference between involved and uninvolved circulating free light chain concentration) for survival prediction.
    - Patients with dFLC <50 mg/L have a significantly better outcome regardless of cardiac stage.
    - A renal staging system (based on 24-h urine protein excretion and eGFR) predicts progression to dialysis.
- **Treatment**
    - Median survival without treatment is typically only **~1–2 years** from diagnosis.
    - Current therapies target the clonal bone marrow plasma cells, similar to multiple myeloma approaches.
    - Oral melphalan and prednisone are **no longer widely used** as they rarely lead to complete hematologic remission or improved survival.
    - Substitution of dexamethasone for prednisone produces higher response rates and more durable remissions, though it's not always well tolerated.
    - **High-dose intravenous (IV) melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM/SCT)**:
        - Produces complete hematologic responses in **~40%** of treated patients.
        - Improvements in organ function and quality of life may occur 6–12 months post-response.
        - Hematologic responses are more durable than in multiple myeloma, with remissions lasting beyond 15 years in some patients.
        - Only **~20–30% of all AL amyloidosis patients are suitable** for this aggressive treatment.
        - Transplantation-related mortality rates are higher than for other hematologic diseases due to impaired organ function at presentation.
        - Amyloid cardiomyopathy, poor nutritional/performance status, and multiorgan disease contribute to morbidity and mortality.
        - A bleeding diathesis from clotting factor X adsorption increases mortality rates (5–10% of patients).
        - **Careful patient selection and expert peritransplantation management are essential** in reducing transplantation-related mortality.
    - For patients with AL amyloidosis and impaired cardiac function or arrhythmias, median survival is **~6 months without treatment**. Cardiac transplantation followed by HDM/SCT can be performed.
    - **For transplant-ineligible patients**:
        - **Bortezomib-based regimens** are now considered the standard of care in most cases.
        - Treatment with bortezomib plus MDex (melphalan and dexamethasone) can overcome effects of gain of 1q21 and t(11;14).
        - If bortezomib is contraindicated (preexisting peripheral neuropathy), MDex or immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., lenalidomide) can be used.
        - High-risk patients (~20%) have advanced cardiac stage (IIIb) or severe heart failure.
    - **Newer agents** like oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib and humanized anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab have been evaluated for relapsed/refractory disease. Anti-fibril small molecules and humanized monoclonal antibodies are also being tested.
    - **Supportive Care**:
        - Nephrotic syndrome: diuretics and supportive stockings for edema; albumin infusions for effective diuresis. ACE inhibitors should be used with caution.
        - Congestive heart failure due to amyloid cardiomyopathy: best treated with diuretics.
        - **Digitalis, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers are relatively contraindicated** as they can interact with amyloid fibrils and worsen heart failure.
        - Amiodarone is used for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.
        - Automatic implantable defibrillators have reduced effectiveness but may benefit some patients.
        - Atrial ablation is effective for atrial fibrillation.
        - Ventricular pacing may be indicated for conduction abnormalities.
        - Anticoagulation should be considered due to increased thromboembolic complications from atrial contractile dysfunction, even without atrial fibrillation.
        - Autonomic neuropathy: α agonists (e.g., midodrine) for postural blood pressure.
        - Gastrointestinal dysfunction: may respond to motility or bulk agents.
        - Nutritional supplementation is important.
- **Localized AL Amyloidosis**
    - Amyloid deposits can be produced by clonal plasma cells infiltrating local sites like airways, bladder, skin, or lymph nodes.
    - May respond to surgical intervention or **low-dose radiation therapy** (typically 20 Gy).
    - Systemic treatment is generally not appropriate.
    - Patients should be referred to specialized centers.

# AA Amyloidosis

- **Etiology and Incidence**
    - Occurs in association with almost any **chronic inflammatory state** (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, familial Mediterranean fever) or **chronic infections** (e.g., tuberculosis, osteomyelitis).
    - Has become less common in the US and Europe (<2% of patients with these diseases) due to advances in anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial therapies.
    - Also associated with Castleman’s disease, lymphomas, and renal cell carcinoma (CT scanning is diagnostically important).
    - Up to 30% of patients have no identifiable underlying disease.
    - **Most frequent systemic amyloidosis in children**.
- **Pathology and Clinical Features**
    - Organ involvement usually begins in the **kidneys**.
    - As disease progresses, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and autonomic neuropathy can occur.
    - Cardiomyopathy is a late manifestation in ~25% of patients.
    - Symptoms and signs of AA disease cannot be reliably distinguished from AL amyloidosis.
    - AA amyloid fibrils are typically composed of an 8-kDa, 76-amino-acid N-terminal portion of the 12-kDa precursor protein **SAA (serum amyloid A)**.
    - SAA is an acute-phase apoprotein, synthesized in the liver and transported by high-density lipoprotein (HDL3).
    - Several years of underlying inflammatory disease causing chronic elevation of SAA levels usually precede fibril formation, though infections can lead to more rapid deposition.
- **Treatment**
    - **Primary therapy consists of treating the underlying inflammatory or infectious disease**.
    - Suppressing or eliminating the inflammatory state/infection decreases SAA concentration, slowing fibril formation.
    - For familial Mediterranean fever, **colchicine** (1.2–1.8 mg/d) is the standard treatment. Colchicine is not helpful for AA amyloidosis of other causes or other amyloidoses.
    - **Tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6 antagonists** can effectively interrupt cytokine signaling, inhibiting hepatic SAA production and limiting AA amyloid deposition.
    - A fibril-specific agent (eprodisate) failed in phase 3 trials.

# ATTR and Familial Amyloidosis (AF)

- **General (Familial Amyloidoses)**
    - **Autosomal dominant diseases** where mutated or variant plasma proteins misfold or aggregate to form beta-sheet rich amyloid deposits.
    - Rare, with an estimated incidence of <1/100,000 in the United States, but higher in areas with founder effects (e.g., Portugal, Sweden, Japan).
    - New amyloidogenic serum proteins continue to be identified, such as leukocyte chemotactic factor LECT2 (a cause of renal amyloidosis in Hispanic and Pakistani populations), though no gene variations have been identified for LECT2.
- **hATTR Amyloidosis (Hereditary Transthyretin)**
    - The most prevalent form of hereditary amyloidosis.
    - Arises from mutation of the abundant liver-derived plasma protein **transthyretin (TTR)**.
    - More than 130 TTR mutations, typically single-amino-acid substitutions, have been described, mostly inducing clinical ATTR amyloid disease.
    - Toxic TTR oligomers and ATTR amyloid deposits target **peripheral and autonomic nervous systems and the heart**.
    - The **V122I TTR variant** occurs in nearly 4% of African-American and Afro-Caribbean populations and is associated with late-onset cardiac amyloidosis.
        - Consider in African-American patients with concentric cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic heart failure, especially without hypertension or valvular disease.
- **ATTRwt Amyloidosis (Wild-type Transthyretin)**
    - Normal (wild-type) transthyretin can also misfold and aggregate to form ATTR amyloid.
    - Typically expressed in men beginning in the **seventh decade**, with increasing prevalence with age.
    - Formerly termed **senile systemic amyloidosis**.
    - Reported at autopsy in 25% of hearts from patients 80 years and older.
    - Aging inefficiencies of intracellular quality-assurance mechanisms likely predispose to protein misaggregation.
    - **Most prevalent and rapidly growing form of amyloidosis globally** due to the number of aging men.
- **Clinical Features and Diagnosis**
    - hATTR amyloidosis has a varied presentation, predicted by the specific TTR mutation. Kindreds typically express similar disease timing and course.
    - Apparent sporadic presentations often reflect incomplete penetrance, not spontaneous events.
    - Presents as **familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy** (nerve damage) or **familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy**(heart damage).
        - Peripheral neuropathy begins as a length-dependent small-fiber sensorimotor neuropathy in the feet, progressing to the upper extremities.
        - Autonomic neuropathy manifests as smooth muscle dysmotility (dysphagia, diarrhea, urinary retention), vascular dysregulation (orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction), and anhidrosis.
    - **Soft tissue disease** (carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonopathy, spinal stenosis) commonly precedes nerve or heart manifestations by 1–2 decades, particularly in ATTRwt amyloid patients who frequently report bicipital, patellar, or Achilles tendon rupture.
    - Less common expressions: vitreous opacities and leptomeningeal amyloid deposition.
    - ATTR amyloid involvement of the heart is clinically **better tolerated than AL amyloid cardiomyopathy**. Median time from heart failure presentation to death in untreated ATTR is 42–48 months, versus 6 months for AL.
    - Typical syndromes for other AF diseases include renal amyloidosis (mutant fibrinogen, lysozyme, apolipoproteins), hepatic amyloidosis (apolipoprotein AI), and cranial neuropathy with corneal lattice dystrophy (gelsolin amyloidosis, pathognomonic).
    - AF patients can present with clinical syndromes mimicking AL disease.
    - It is important to screen both for plasma cell disorders and for mutations in patients with amyloidosis.
    - While mass spectrometry often detects amino acid sequence variations, **DNA sequencing is the diagnostic standard for AF mutations**.
- **Treatment**
    - Untreated, the survival period after onset of ATTR disease is **5–15 years**.
    - Three therapeutic strategies:
        1. **Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)**: Replaces the factory of the mutated protein (only applicable to hATTR). Largely limited to patients with hATTR amyloid and early peripheral neuropathy (V30M ATTR). Most patients with non-V30M TTR mutations suffer post-transplant progressive amyloid disease due to wild-type TTR from the allograft liver depositing on preexisting amyloid.
        2. **Stabilization of circulating TTR tetramers**: Prevents TTR monomer release and amyloid fibril formation. Successfully inhibits progressive ATTR amyloid nerve and heart disease. **Diflunisal** (a repurposed NSAID) and **tafamidis** (a proprietary thyroxine mimetic) bind TTR tetramers, minimizing release of the amyloidogenic TTR monomer and slowing progression. **Tafamidis** is the first U.S. FDA-approved treatment for ATTR amyloid cardiomyopathy; it extends survival and slows decline in walking capacities and quality of life but does not appear to induce improvement in heart thickening or function.
        3. **TTR gene silencing** (RNA interference or anti-sense oligonucleotide agents): Suppresses hepatic TTR production to eliminate ATTR fibril formation. More reliably stops neurologic disease progression and improves sensory nerve deficits in 35–60% of hATTR patients. Preliminary data suggest TTR gene silencers may promote heart remodeling and improve systolic function.
    - The therapeutic future for ATTR amyloid patients is promising.
    - Phase 3 trials examining safety and effectiveness of TTR gene silencers for cardiomyopathy are underway, as are studies for second-generation silencers for neuropathy and cardiomyopathy.
    - **TTR gene editing** (to prevent mRNA production or correct DNA mutations) is the next frontier.
    - Future challenges include therapies that cross the blood-brain barrier to address leptomeningeal (brain) and vitreous (eye) amyloid deposition.

# Aβ2M Amyloidosis

- **Characteristics and Causes**
    - Composed of **β2-microglobulin**, the invariant chain of class I human leukocyte antigens.
    - Produces rheumatologic manifestations in patients undergoing **long-term hemodialysis**. Rarely, a hereditary form exists.
    - β2-Microglobulin is excreted by the kidney, and levels become elevated in end-stage renal disease.
    - Its molecular mass (11.8 kDa) is above the cutoff of some older dialysis membranes.
    - Incidence appears to be declining with the use of newer high-flow dialysis techniques.
- **Clinical Presentation**
    - Usually presents as **carpal tunnel syndrome, persistent joint effusions, spondyloarthropathy, or cystic bone lesions**.
    - **Carpal tunnel syndrome is often the first symptom**.
    - Persistent joint effusions (mild discomfort) were found in up to 50% of patients dialyzed for >12 years.
    - Involvement is bilateral, and large joints (shoulders, knees, wrists, hips) are most frequently affected.
    - Synovial fluid is noninflammatory, and β2M amyloid can be found if the sediment is stained with Congo red.
    - Less common, but visceral β2M amyloid deposits occasionally occur in the gastrointestinal tract, heart, tendons, and subcutaneous tissues of the buttocks.
- **Treatment**
    - **No proven specific therapies** for Aβ2M amyloidosis.
    - Cessation of dialysis after renal allografting may lead to symptomatic improvement.

# Therapeutic Frontiers

- Treatment strategies have historically focused on **limiting the formation of amyloidogenic proteins**.
- Future approaches aim at **disruption of existing amyloid** by targeting ubiquitous components of tissue deposits, theoretically improving end-organ function.
- Clinical trial validation for these disruption strategies remains elusive.

# Summary

- A diagnosis of amyloidosis should be considered in patients with unexplained: **nephropathy, cardiomyopathy (particularly with diastolic dysfunction), neuropathy (peripheral or autonomic), enteropathy**, or the pathognomonic soft tissue findings of **macroglossia or periorbital ecchymoses**.
- **Pathologic identification of amyloid fibrils** can be made with Congo red staining of aspirated abdominal fat or an involved-organ biopsy specimen.
- **Accurate typing** (by immunologic, biochemical, and genetic testing) is **essential** for selecting appropriate therapy.
- Systemic amyloidosis should be considered a treatable condition.
    - Anti–plasma cell chemotherapy is highly effective in AL disease.
    - Targeted therapies are being developed for AA and ATTR disease.
- The combination of precursor and end-organ amyloid therapeutics can provide disease control, functional improvements, and quality of life improvements.
- Tertiary referral centers offer specialized diagnostic techniques and access to clinical trials for these rare diseases.

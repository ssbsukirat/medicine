# Clinical presentation 
## Signs and symptoms 
* Most often recognised by abnormal screening test 
* Acute due to blood loss or hemolysis 
* if mild, enhanced O2 delivery is achieved through changes in the O2–hemoglobin dissociation curve mediated by a ***decreased pH or increased CO2 (Bohr effect***)
* With acute blood loss, hypovolemia dominates the clinical picture 
	* ***Signs of vascular instability appear with acute losses of 10–15%*** of volume. issue is hypotension and decreased organ perfusion.
	* When >30%  volume lost suddenly,  unable to compensate with the usual mechanisms of vascular contraction and changes in regional blood flow.  prefers to remain supine and will show ***postural hypotension and tachycardia.***
	* If  volume lost is ***>40% (i.e., >2 L in the average-sized adult), signs of hypovolemic shock including confusion, dyspnea, diaphoresis, hypotension, and tachycardia appear***
* because of  compensatory mechanisms that govern the O2–hemoglobin dissociation curve,  gradual onset of anemia, particularly in young patients may not be associated with signs or symptoms until the anemia is severe (hemoglobin <70–80 g/L or 7–8 g/dL)
* With chronic anemia, intracellular levels of ***2,3-bisphosphoglycerate rise***, shifting the dissociation curve to the right and facilitating O2 unloading (only ***upto 2-3g/dl loss***)

## Approach to Anemia 
* Nutrition history , drugs, alcohol, family history 
* symptoms and signs such as bleeding, fatigue, malaise, fever, weight loss, night sweats, and other systemic symptoms 
* mechanisms of anemia may be provided on physical examination by findings of infection, blood in the stool, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly (Lymphoproliferative disorders), or petechiae (platelet dysfunction)
* physical examination may demonstrate a forceful heartbeat, strong peripheral pulses, and a systolic “flow” murmur. 
* The skin and mucous membranes may be pale if the hemoglobin is <8–10 g/dL (80–100 g/L)
	* focus on areas where vessels are close to the surface such as the mucous membranes, nail beds, and palmar creases. 
	* If the palmar creases are lighter in color than the surrounding skin when the hand is hyperextended, the hemoglobin level is usually <8 g/dL (80 g/L)
### Lab evaluation 
* ![[Anemia-evaluation.png]]
* ![[anemia-evaluation2.png]]
#### PBF
* complement to red cell indices 
* reveals variations in cell size (anisocytosis)
	* increase in RDW or range of sizes
* and shape (poikilocytosis)
	* suggests defect in maturation of RBC precursor in marrow or fragmentation of circulating RBCs 
* polychromasia 
	* red cells that are slightly larger than normal and grayish blue in color on the Wright-Giemsa stain.
	* reticulocytes that have been released prematurely from the bone marrow 
	* color represents residual amounts of ribosomal RNA. 
	* appear in circulation in response to EPO stimulation or to architectural damage of the bone marrow (fibrosis, infiltration of the marrow by malignant cells, etc.) that results in their disordered release from the marrow.

#### Reticulocytes Count 
* Key to initial classification 
* Reticulocytes are RBCs recently released from marrow 
* Supravital dye that precipitates RNA ribosomal 
* This residual RNA is metabolized over the first 24–36 h of the reticulocyte’s life span in circulation.
* Normally, the reticulocyte count ranges from 1% to 2% and reflects the daily replacement of 0.8–1.0% of the circulating red cell population
* Initially , compare reticulocyte count to expected response 
* if the EPO and erythroid marrow responses to moderate anemia (hemoglobin <100 g/L (10 g/dL)) are intact, the red cell production rate increases to two to three times normal within 10 days following the onset of anemia.
* a reticulocyte response less than two to three times normal indicates an inadequate marrow response.
* Correction necessary (doubly corrected is ***Reticulocytes Production Index*** )
	* ![[rpi-correction.png]]
	* For Anemia 
		* adjusts the reticulocyte count based on the reduced number of circulating red cells. With anemia, the percentage of reticulocytes may be increased while the absolute number is unchanged. 
		* To correct for this effect, the reticulocyte percentage is multiplied by the ratio of the patient’s hemoglobin or hematocrit to the expected hemoglobin/hematocrit for the age and sex of the patient
	* For immature reticulocytes 
		* depending on whether some of the reticulocytes in circulation have been released from the marrow prematurely. 
		* The peripheral blood smear is examined to see if there are polychromatophilic macrocytes (Shift cells) present.
		* survive as reticulocytes in circulation for >1 day, thereby providing a falsely high estimate of daily red cell production.
		* ![[rpi-correction2.png]]
		* If polychromasia absent dont correct 
		* should always be applied to a patient with anemia and a very high reticulocyte count to provide a true index of effective red cell production
* confirms the fact that the patient has an appropriate EPO response, a normally function- ing bone marrow, and sufficient iron available to meet the demands for new red cell formation.
#### Iron supply and storage 
* S. Fe (9 to 27 μmol/L (50–150 μg/dL)), TIBC (54–64 μmol/L (300–360 μg/dL)), percentage transferrin saturation (25-50%)
* The percent transferrin saturation is derived by dividing the serum iron level (× 100) by the TIBC.
* diurnal variation in the serum iron leads to a variation in the percent transferrin saturation 
* Ferritin
	* Total body iron stores
	* males ~100 micrograms/L total 1g
	* females postmenopausal 30 micrograms/L total 300mg 
	* ferritin is also an acute-phase reac- tant and, in the presence of acute or chronic inflammation, may rise several-fold above baseline levels.
	* if >200 means atleast some stores present 
#### Bone marrow 
* In patients with hypoproliferative anemia, normal renal function, and normal iron status, a bone marrow is indicated.
* The increase or decrease of one cell lineage (myeloid vs erythroid) compared to another is obtained by a differential count of nucleated cells in a bone marrow smear (the myeloid/erythroid M/E ratio).
* A patient with a hypoproliferative anemia and a reticulocyte production index <2 will demonstrate an M/E ratio of 2 or 3:1. 
* In contrast, patients with hemolytic disease and a production index >3 will have an M/E ratio of at least 1:1.
* Maturation disorders are identified from the ***discrepancy*** between the M/E ratio and the reticulocyte production index
* Can check for iron stores in the form of Ferritin or Hemosiderin
* Sideroblasts
	* small ferritin granules can normally be seen under oil immersion in 20–40% of developing erythroblasts.

## Hypoproliferative Anemias
* 75% of all anemias 
* Absolute or relative marrow failure 
* Mostly due to mild to moderate iron deficiency or inflammation 
* Causes 
	* marrow damage 
	* iron deficiency 
	* inadequate EPO stimulation
		* impaired renal function (may produce RBCs at normal rates)
			* If DM or multiple myeloma maybe more pronounced than degree of renal dysfunction 
		* suppression of EPO production by inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1
		* reduced tissue needs for O2 from metabolic disease such as hypothyroidism
* Normocytic Normochromic mostly but maybe microcytic hypochromic if iron deficiency or chronic inflammation 
* Tests
	* Iron profile (Serum iron and TIBC)
	* Renal and thyroid function 
	* Marrow aspiration or biopsies 
	* Ferritin for stores 
* Acute or chronic inflammation 
	* Regulated by ***Hepcidin***
		* Produced by liver
		* ***Increased*** in inflammation 
	* Low serum iron 
	* TIBC normal or low 
	* Transferrin saturation low 
	* ***Ferritin normal or high***
* mild to moderate iron deficiency 
	* Low serum iron
	* high TIBC
	* low percent transferrin saturation
	* ***low serum ferritin***

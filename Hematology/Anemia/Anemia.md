# Clinical presentation 
## Signs and symptoms 
* Most often recognised by abnormal screening test 
* Acute due to blood loss or hemolysis 
* if mild, enhanced O2 delivery is achieved through changes in the O2–hemoglobin dissociation curve mediated by a ***decreased pH or increased CO2 (Bohr effect***)
* With acute blood loss, hypovolemia dominates the clinical picture 
	* ***Signs of vascular instability appear with acute losses of 10–15%*** of volume. issue is hypotension and decreased organ perfusion.
	* When >30%  volume lost suddenly,  unable to compensate with the usual mechanisms of vascular contraction and changes in regional blood flow.  prefers to remain supine and will show ***postural hypotension and tachycardia.***
	* If  volume lost is ***>40% (i.e., >2 L in the average-sized adult), signs of hypovolemic shock including confusion, dyspnea, diaphoresis, hypotension, and tachycardia appear***

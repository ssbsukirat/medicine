# Clinical presentation 
## Signs and symptoms 
* Most often recognised by abnormal screening test 
* Acute due to blood loss or hemolysis 
* if mild, enhanced O2 delivery is achieved through changes in the O2–hemoglobin dissociation curve mediated by a ***decreased pH or increased CO2 (Bohr effect***)
* With acute blood loss, hypovolemia dominates the clinical picture 
	* ***Signs of vascular instability appear with acute losses of 10–15%*** of volume. issue is hypotension and decreased organ perfusion.
	* When >30%  volume lost suddenly,  unable to compensate with the usual mechanisms of vascular contraction and changes in regional blood flow.  prefers to remain supine and will show ***postural hypotension and tachycardia.***
	* If  volume lost is ***>40% (i.e., >2 L in the average-sized adult), signs of hypovolemic shock including confusion, dyspnea, diaphoresis, hypotension, and tachycardia appear***
* because of  compensatory mechanisms that govern the O2–hemoglobin dissociation curve,  gradual onset of anemia, particularly in young patients may not be associated with signs or symptoms until the anemia is severe (hemoglobin <70–80 g/L or 7–8 g/dL)
* With chronic anemia, intracellular levels of ***2,3-bisphosphoglycerate rise***, shifting the dissociation curve to the right and facilitating O2 unloading (only ***upto 2-3g/dl loss***)

## Approach to Anemia 
* Nutrition history , drugs, alcohol, family history 
* symptoms and signs such as bleeding, fatigue, malaise, fever, weight loss, night sweats, and other systemic symptoms 
* mechanisms of anemia may be provided on physical examination by findings of infection, blood in the stool, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly (Lymphoproliferative disorders), or petechiae (platelet dysfunction)
* physical examination may demonstrate a forceful heartbeat, strong peripheral pulses, and a systolic “flow” murmur. 
* The skin and mucous membranes may be pale if the hemoglobin is <8–10 g/dL (80–100 g/L)
	* focus on areas where vessels are close to the surface such as the mucous membranes, nail beds, and palmar creases. 
	* If the palmar creases are lighter in color than the surrounding skin when the hand is hyperextended, the hemoglobin level is usually <8 g/dL (80 g/L)
### Lab evaluation

* ![[anemia-evaluation2.png]]
#### PBF
* complement to red cell indices 
* reveals variations in cell size (anisocytosis)
	* increase in RDW or range of sizes
* and shape (poikilocytosis)
	* suggests defect in maturation of RBC precursor in marrow or fragmentation of circulating RBCs 
* polychromasia 
	* red cells that are slightly larger than normal and grayish blue in color on the Wright-Giemsa stain.
	* reticulocytes that have been released prematurely from the bone marrow 
	* color represents residual amounts of ribosomal RNA. 
	* appear in circulation in response to EPO stimulation or to architectural damage of the bone marrow (fibrosis, infiltration of the marrow by malignant cells, etc.) that results in their disordered release from the marrow.

#### Reticulocytes Count 
* Key to initial classification 
* Reticulocytes are RBCs recently released from marrow 
* Supravital dye that precipitates RNA ribosomal 
* This residual RNA is metabolized over the first 24–36 h of the reticulocyte’s life span in circulation.
* Normally, the reticulocyte count ranges from 1% to 2% and reflects the daily replacement of 0.8–1.0% of the circulating red cell population
* Initially , compare reticulocyte count to expected response 
* if the EPO and erythroid marrow responses to moderate anemia (hemoglobin <100 g/L (10 g/dL)) are intact, the red cell production rate increases to two to three times normal within 10 days following the onset of anemia.
* a reticulocyte response less than two to three times normal indicates an inadequate marrow response.
* Correction necessary (doubly corrected is ***Reticulocytes Production Index*** )
	* ![[rpi-correction.png]]
	* For Anemia 
		* adjusts the reticulocyte count based on the reduced number of circulating red cells. With anemia, the percentage of reticulocytes may be increased while the absolute number is unchanged. 
		* To correct for this effect, the reticulocyte percentage is multiplied by the ratio of the patient’s hemoglobin or hematocrit to the expected hemoglobin/hematocrit for the age and sex of the patient
	* For immature reticulocytes 
		* depending on whether some of the reticulocytes in circulation have been released from the marrow prematurely. 
		* The peripheral blood smear is examined to see if there are polychromatophilic macrocytes (Shift cells) present.
		* survive as reticulocytes in circulation for >1 day, thereby providing a falsely high estimate of daily red cell production.
		* ![[rpi-correction2.png]]
		* If polychromasia absent dont correct 
		* should always be applied to a patient with anemia and a very high reticulocyte count to provide a true index of effective red cell production

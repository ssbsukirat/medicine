# Clinical presentation 
## Signs and symptoms 
* Most often recognised by abnormal screening test 
* Acute due to blood loss or hemolysis 
* if mild, enhanced O2 delivery is achieved through changes in the O2–hemoglobin dissociation curve mediated by a ***decreased pH or increased CO2 (Bohr effect***)
* With acute blood loss, hypovolemia dominates the clinical picture 
	* ***Signs of vascular instability appear with acute losses of 10–15%*** of volume. issue is hypotension and decreased organ perfusion.
	* When >30%  volume lost suddenly,  unable to compensate with the usual mechanisms of vascular contraction and changes in regional blood flow.  prefers to remain supine and will show ***postural hypotension and tachycardia.***
	* If  volume lost is ***>40% (i.e., >2 L in the average-sized adult), signs of hypovolemic shock including confusion, dyspnea, diaphoresis, hypotension, and tachycardia appear***
* because of  compensatory mechanisms that govern the O2–hemoglobin dissociation curve,  gradual onset of anemia, particularly in young patients may not be associated with signs or symptoms until the anemia is severe (hemoglobin <70–80 g/L or 7–8 g/dL)
* With chronic anemia, intracellular levels of ***2,3-bisphosphoglycerate rise***, shifting the dissociation curve to the right and facilitating O2 unloading (only ***upto 2-3g/dl loss***)

## Approach to Anemia 
* Nutrition history , drugs, alcohol, family history 
* symptoms and signs such as bleeding, fatigue, malaise, fever, weight loss, night sweats, and other systemic symptoms 
* mechanisms of anemia may be provided on physical examination by findings of infection, blood in the stool, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly (Lymphoproliferative disorders), or petechiae (platelet dysfunction)
* physical examination may demonstrate a forceful heartbeat, strong peripheral pulses, and a systolic “flow” murmur. 
* The skin and mucous membranes may be pale if the hemoglobin is <8–10 g/dL (80–100 g/L)
	* focus on areas where vessels are close to the surface such as the mucous membranes, nail beds, and palmar creases. 
	* If the palmar creases are lighter in color than the surrounding skin when the hand is hyperextended, the hemoglobin level is usually <8 g/dL (80 g/L)
### Lab evaluation

#### PBF
* complement to red cell indices 
* reveals variations in cell size (anisocytosis)
	* increase in RDW or range of sizes
* and shape (poikilocytosis)
	* suggests defect in maturation of RBC precursor in marrow or fragmentation of circulating RBCs

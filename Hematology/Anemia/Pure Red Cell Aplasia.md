* Restrictive form of marrow failure 
	* aregenerative anemia as in PRCA,
	* thrombocytopenia with amegakaryocytosis 
	* neutropenia without marrow myeloid cells in agranulocytosis
		* most common 
		* usually due to drugs 
		* more in older adults and women 
		* resolves after discontinuing exposure 
		* neutrpenia causes high mortality 
	* Progress to pancytopenia or leukemia is rare 

# Definition and Differential 
* Anemia, reticulocytopenia , absent or rare erythroid precursors in marrow 
* ![[prcaclass.png]]
* Diamond-Blackfan anemia
	* congenital PRCA 
	* ribsomopathy 
	* diagnosed at birth or early childhood 
	* responds well to glucocorticoid therapy 
* Temporary red cell failure
	* transient aplastic crisis of hemolytic anemias due to acute parvovirus infection 
	* transient erythroblastopenia of childhood which occurs in normal children.
# Clinical association and etiology 
* association with immune system disease 
* T-cell inhibition in most 
* Minority of cases with thymoma 
* can be the major manifestation of large granular lymphocytosis or complicates chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
* hypogammaglobulinemia
* 5q- syndrome 
	* ribosomal protein gene deletion
	* MDS may manifest as PRCA 
* idiosyncratic drug reaction 
* subcutaneous EPO administration 
	* neutralising antibodies to hormone 
* Due to antibodies to blood group antigens as in allogenic stem cell transplant 

# Persistent Parvovirus B19 infection 
* Treatable cause of PRCA 
* Benign exanthem of childhood 
* ***Fifth disease***
* polyarthralgia/arthritis syndrome in adults 
* in underlying hemolytic conditions 
	* transient aplastic crisis 
	* temporary abrupt worsening of anemia due to failed erythropoiesis 
* Infection resolved by neutralising antibodies to virus

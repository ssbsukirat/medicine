* Restrictive form of marrow failure 
	* aregenerative anemia as in PRCA,
	* thrombocytopenia with amegakaryocytosis 
	* neutropenia without marrow myeloid cells in agranulocytosis
		* most common 
		* usually due to drugs 
		* more in older adults and women 
		* resolves after discontinuing exposure 
		* neutrpenia causes high mortality 
	* Progress to pancytopenia or leukemia is rare

* ![[prcaclass.png]]
* Diamond-Blackfan anemia
	* congenital PRCA 
	* ribsomopathy 
	* diagnosed at birth or early childhood 
	* responds well to glucocorticoid therapy 
* Temporary red cell failure
	* transient aplastic crisis of hemolytic anemias due to acute parvovirus infection 
	* transient erythroblastopenia of childhood which occurs in normal children.
# Clinical association and etiology 
* association with immune system disease 
* Minority of cases with thymoma 
* can be the major manifestation of large granular lymphocytosis or complicates chronic lymphocytic leukemia

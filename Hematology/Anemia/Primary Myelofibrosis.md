* Chronic PMF, aka, 
	* idiopathic myelofibrosis, 
	* agnogenic myeloid metaplasia
	* myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia
* clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder associated with mutations in JAK2, MPL, or CALR 
* characterized by marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and splenomegaly
* Least common MPN 
* primarily afflicts men in their sixth decade or later

# Etiology 
* No specific cytogenetic abnormalities detected 
* Nonrandom chromosome abnormalities
	* 9p
	* 20q−  
	* 13q− 
	* trisomy 8 or 9
	* partial trisomy 1q
* ***JAK2 V617F*** present in ∼55% 
* mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor, ***MPL***, occur in ~4%.
* mutations in the calreticulin gene (***CALR***) that alter the carboxy-terminal portion of the protein, permitting it to bind and activate MPL.
* degree of myelofibrosis and the extent of extramedullary hematopoiesis not related
* Fibrosis is associated with overproduction of transforming growth factor β and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 
* osteosclerosis is associated with overproduction of osteoprotegerin, an osteoclast inhibitor.
* Marrow angiogenesis due to VEGF 
* Fibroblasts are polyclonal and not part of neoplastic clone

* Chronic PMF, aka, 
	* idiopathic myelofibrosis, 
	* agnogenic myeloid metaplasia
	* myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia
* clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder associated with mutations in JAK2, MPL, or CALR 
* characterized by marrow fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and splenomegaly
* Least common MPN 
* primarily afflicts men in their sixth decade or later

# Etiology 
* No specific cytogenetic abnormalities detected 
* Nonrandom chromosome abnormalities
	* 9p
	* 20q−  
	* 13q− 
	* trisomy 8 or 9
	* partial trisomy 1q
* ***JAK2 V617F*** present in ∼55% 
* mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor, ***MPL***, occur in ~4%.
* mutations in the calreticulin gene (***CALR***) that alter the carboxy-terminal portion of the protein, permitting it to bind and activate MPL.
* degree of myelofibrosis and the extent of extramedullary hematopoiesis not related
* Fibrosis is associated with overproduction of transforming growth factor β and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 
* osteosclerosis is associated with overproduction of osteoprotegerin, an osteoclast inhibitor.
* Marrow angiogenesis due to VEGF 
* Fibroblasts are polyclonal and not part of neoplastic clone

# Clinical Features 
* No specific signs or symptoms 
* Many are asymptomatic at presentation 
* often detected by the discovery of splenic enlargement and/or abnormal blood counts during a routine examination
* night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss are common
* PBF will show the characteristic features of ***extramedullary hematopoiesis:*** teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present
* Anemia, usually mild initially is common 
* WBC, Platelets 
	* usually normal or slight increased 
	* either may be depressed
* Mild hepatomegaly
	* only with splenomegaly 
	* not isolated usually 
* Single LN+ should prompt other diagnosis 
* LDH and ALP maybe elevated 
* Marrow inaspirable
* Bone xray Osteosclerosis 
* Extramedullary hematopoiesis may cause 
	* ascites
	* portal or pulmonary or intracranial HTN 
	* Intestine or ureter obstruction
	* pericardial tamponade 
	* spinal cord compression
	* skin nodules
* Hyperuricemia and secondary gout 
* Splenomegaly maybe rapid and cause splenic infarct, fever and pleuritic chest pain 

# Diagnosis 
* Diagnosis of exclusion 
* rule out disorders causing myelofibrosis 
* Overlap with CML, PV
* Extramedullary hematopoiesis established by 
	* teardrop-shaped red cells 
	* nucleated red cells, 
	* myelocytes, and promyelocytes
* MPN established by (not secondary cause)
	* presence of leukocytosis,
	* thrombocytosis with large and bizarre platelets 
	* circulating myelocytes
* Marrow inaspirable but biopsy 
	* hypercellular marrow with trilineage hyperplasia 
	* increased numbers of megakaryocytes in clusters and with large, dysplastic nuclei.
	* Cannot distinguish from other MPN based on marrow 
* Immune abnormalities 
	* immune complexes, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, or a positive Coombs’ test
	* +/- role in pathogenesis 
* Cytogenetic 
	* rule out CML 
	* Prognosis purp

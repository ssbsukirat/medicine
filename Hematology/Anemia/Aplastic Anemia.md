* [[Bone Marrow Failure]] 
* Defined as pancytopenia with bone marrow hypocellularity 
* Maybe iatrogenic, acquired or genetic as part of constitutional syndromes 
* ![[aplasticclass.png]]
* Acquired 
	* Stereotypical presentation 
	* Abrupt onset low counts in previously normal adults 
	* Seronegative hepatitis or course of drug may precede
	* Anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia maybe present in any combination 
* Related to PNH and MDS so distinction is very difficult 
# Epidemiology 
* M = F
* Age is biphasic
	* teens and twenties
	* older adults 

# Etiology 
* Relationships are not reliable 
* most are idiopathic 
## Radiation
* Major **acute sequala** of radiation exposure (usually *not chronic*)
* Damages DNA 
* High mitosis tissue most affected
* Seen in
	* POwer plant workers 
	* healthcare workers 
	* Labs
	* Industrial
* Radiation dose can be extracted from rate and degree  of fall in counts 
* Dosimetric reconstruction helps estimate prognosis and protect healthcare workers from exposure to radioactive tissue and excreta 
* **MDS and Leukemia** are ***Chronic*** effects of radiation 
## Chemicals
* Benzene is notorious, usually used as solvent
* History of job exposure is important 
* Incidence of ***leukemia*** is correlated to ***cumulative exposure but susceptiblity*** is important 
* Usually ***not as a late exposure*** 

## Drugs 
* Chemotherapeutic drugs cause as major toxicity 
* Dose dependent usually 
* Idiosyncratic reactions usually occur ***without*** a dose response relationship 
* Association is not causation 
	* Drug may have been used to treat symptoms of [[Bone Marrow Failure]] like fever or viral illness 
	* May provoke 1st symptoms of disease 
* Idiosyncratic reactions are a rare event 
* ![[aplasticdrugs.png]]

## Infections 
* In many viral and bacterial infections 
* Usually ***mild and transient***

## Immunological Diseases 
* Major consequence and cause of death in ***Transfusion associated graft vs Host Disease (GVHD)*** 
* Occurs after infusion of nonirradiated blood products in immunodeficient patients 
* Associated with Eosinophilic Fascitis (collagen vascular disease) with painful subcutaneous induration 
* Thymoma and hypoimmunoglobulinemia 
* SLE 

## Hepatitis 
* 5% cases 
* Young men post recovery 1-2 months later 
* Severe pancytopenia 
* Seronegative hepatitis , presumed to be immune mediated 
* Fulminant hepatic failure is a sequala of seronegative hepatitis in children and pancytopenia maybe seen 

## Pregnancy 
usually resolves with delivery 
## PNH
- acquired mutations in PIG-A gene
- Mutations may occur in normal individual without PNH development
- If PIG-A mutants proliferate, clones deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol linked cell membrane surface protein
- These clones detected in 50% of patients on flow cytometry
- Bone marrow of PNH patients show defective hematopoiesis also (even in hemolytic manifestation)
- young patients with PNH may later develop Frank marrow aplasia and pancytopenia

## constitutional syndromes
- fanconi Anemia 
    - autosomal recessive
        - most common is type A with FANCA mutation
        - Most form products that activate FANCD2 by monoubiquitination that plays role in DNA repair and cross-linking
    - Congenital development abnormalities
        - short stature
        - Cafe au lait spots
        - Thumb radius and genitourinary tract anomalies 
    - Progressive pancytopenia
    - Risk of malignancy
    - Chromosomes susceptible to DNA cross-linking damage
        - chromosome breakage study using diepoxybutane or mitomycin c is based on this 
- Shwachman-Diamond syndrome
    - ribosomopathies 
    - Ribosomal assembly defects
    - Early presentation
    - Neutropenia
    - Pancreatic insufficiency
    - Malabsorption
- Diamond-blackfan Anemia
- Telomeropathies
    - alterations in telomere repair or SHELTERIN protein
    - Dyskeratosis congenita 
        - pediatrics
        - Mucous membrane leukoplakia
        - Dystrophic nails
        - Reticular hyperpigmentation
        - Early aplastic Anemia
        - Due to defect in telomere repair complex
        - X linked in DKC1 dyskerin gene
        - AD in TERC defect (rare)
    - TERC and TERT defect
        - reverse transcriptase code
        - Mild and subtle
        - Maybe in adults also
        - Aplastic Anemia or macrocytic Anemia or thrombocytopenia
        - Chronic non progressive
        - Early hair greying is clue to diagnosis
        - Maybe family history of pulmonary fibrosis and hepatic cirrhosis
    - Measurements of telomere length of WBC is commercially available test 

# Pathophysiology
- severe damage to hematopoietic stem cells
- Replacement of marrow by fat seen in biopsy and MRI
- CD34 cells are marker of hematopoietic cells and markedly reduced
- Stem cell pool < 1% 
- Committed and progenitor cells absent on functional studies
## Constitutional syndromes
- intrinsic stem cell defect
- DNA repair defects in fanconi
- Telomere repair defects
- GATA AND RUNX mutations affect signal transduction
## chemical and drug injury
- extrinsic damage
- Massive physical or chemical insult
- Altered drug metabolism causes idiosyncratic reactions
    - polar drugs and low water soluble drugs undergo enzymatic degradation
    - Degradation produces highly reactive eosinophilic compounds which are toxic by binding cellular macromolecules
    - Hydroquinone and quinolones cause injury in benzene exposure

## immune stem cell destruction
- suggested by recovery of patients by treating with antilymphocyte globulin
- Removal of t cells from aplastic marrow improves function in vitro
- Activated cytotoxic t cells decline with immunosuppressive therapy usually
- Type 1 cytokines involved
- IFN-gamma induces Fas expression on CD34 cells causing apoptosis
- Genetic determined features of immune response convert physiological response to sustained abnormal autoimmune process
    - HLA polymorphism
    - Cytokines genes
    - T cell proliferation and effector genes 

# Clinical features
## history
- abrupt or insidious
- Bleeding most common early symptom
    - easy brising
    - Oozing from gums
    - Epistaxis 
    - Heavy menstrual flow
    - Petechiae rarely
    - Massive hemorrhage unusual but sometimes ICH or intraretinal hemorrhage maybe seen
- Symptomatic Anemia 
    - lassitude, weakness, shortness of breath, pounding sensation in ear
- Infection is unusual first symptom
- Agranulocytosis 
    - pharyngitis anorectal infection or sepsis occurs early
- Patients usually look and feel good despite low counts
- History of drug chemical viral illness
- Family history
- Systemic complaint and weight loss should point to other etiology
## physical examination
- petechiae and ecchymoses typical
- Retinal hemorrhage maybe present
- Pelvic and rectal exam can be deferred
    - perform with gentleness to avoid trauma 
    - May show bleeding from cervical os or blood in stool
- Pallor of skin and mucous
- Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly atypical
# Laboratory studies
## blood 
- large erythrocytes
- Paucity of platelets and granulocyte
- MCV is high
- Reticulocyte absent or few 
- Lympho normal or low
- Immature myeloid cells suggest MDS or leukaemia
- Nucleated RBC suggest marrow fibrosis or tumour invasion
- Abnormal platelet suggest peripheral destruction or MDS
# bone marrow
- readily aspirated but dilute
- fatty specimen maybe pale on withdrawal
- Dry tap suggest fibrosis or myelophthisis 
- Severe aplasia shows only red cells, residual lymphos and stromal cells
- Biopsy is better for cellularity and shows fat under microscope
- hematopoietic cells < 25% 
- Poor correlation between cellularity and severity as hotspot of hematopoiesis maybe seen
- Residual hematopoietic cells should have normal morphology except for mildly megaloblastic erythropoiesis
- Granulomas indicate infections
- Biopsy must be >1 cm in length

## ancillary studies
- chromosome breakage study using diepoxybutane or mitomycin c in children and young to exclude fanconi 
- Telomere length
- Chromosome studies usually negative
- Flow cytometry for PNH
- EBV or HIV maybe positive
## genomics
- Next generation sequencing allows testing of large numbers of genes 
- Germline panels examine 50 or more genes if constitutional syndromes suspected  
- Somatic mutations if MDS is suspected 
- Myeloid neoplasm gene panels test 100 genes 

# Diagnosis 
* Pancytopenia with fatty bone marrow 
* In young always suspected if pancytopenia  
* Difficult if atypical presentation 
	* Acquired vs atypical 
		* Marrow is indistinguishable except megakaryocytic atypia in GATA2 deficiency 
		* AML and MDS in pedigree should workup predisposition like RUNX1 mutation 
	* Aplastic vs MDS 
		* MDS shows morphological abnormalities 
		* Immune aplastic vs low risk MDS is very thin boundary 

# Prognosis 
* Rapid deterioration and death 
* provision of RBC followed by Platelets then antibiotic 
* major prognosis indicator is counts 
* Severe disease (2/3)
	* ANC < 500/uL
	* Platelets  < 20000/uL
	* Corrected reticulocyte count <1% / Absolute < 60000/uL
* Predictors of response 
	* Absolute reticulocyte > 25000/uL
	* Lymphos > 1000/uL
* Other factors 
	* PNH clones
		* indicates immune pathology responding to immunosuppressive 
	* Short telomeres 
		* shows stem cell reserves, regenerative stress and susceptiblity to chromosome instability 
	* Somatic mutation in WBCs
* Mutations like ASXL1 and DNMT3A show worse prognosis and clonal evolution 

# Treatment 
* replacement of the absent hematopoietic cells (and the immune system) by stem cell transplant
* ameliorated by suppression of the immune system to allow recovery of the patientâ€™s residual bone marrow function 
* Glucocorticoids are not of value as primary therapy. 
* Suspect exposures to drugs or chemicals should be discontinued 
* spontaneous recovery of severe blood count depression is rarely 
* waiting period before beginning treatment not  advisable unless the blood counts are only modestly depressed.
## Hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
* first choice for the younger patient with a fully histocompatible sibling donor
* Order HLA as soon as diagnosis made 
* transfusion of blood from family members should be avoided to prevent sensitization 
* Prefer leucocyte depleted blood products 
* Allogenic transplant from sibling has ~90% survival 
* Higher morbidity and mortality in adults due to chronic GVHD and infections 
* full phenotypic match can be found within the family and serve as well 
* high-resolution matching at HLA, outcomes are similar to those with sibling donors, but with more frequent complication 
* Cord blood can be used as stem cells 
* HLA haploidentical family donor is increasingly popular, as a donor is almost always quickly available 
* Posttransplant cyclophosphamide appears effective in preventing GVHD.
* Routine radiation not given to avoid cancer 
## Immunosuppression

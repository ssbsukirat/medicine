* [[Bone Marrow Failure]] 
* Defined as pancytopenia with bone marrow hypocellularity 
* Maybe iatrogenic, acquired or genetic as part of constitutional syndromes 
* ![[aplasticclass.png]]
* Acquired 
	* Stereotypical presentation 
	* Abrupt onset low counts in previously normal adults 
	* Seronegative hepatitis or course of drug may precede
	* Anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia maybe present in any combination 
* Related to PNH and MDS so distinction is very difficult 
# Epidemiology 
* M = F
* Age is biphasic
	* teens and twenties
	* older adults 

# Etiology 
* Relationships are not reliable 
* most are idiopathic 
## Radiation
* Major **acute sequala** of radiation exposure (usually *not chronic*)
* Damages DNA 
* High mitosis tissue most affected
* Seen in
	* POwer plant workers 
	* healthcare workers 
	* Labs
	* Industrial
* Radiation dose can be extracted from rate and degree  of fall in counts 
* Dosimetric reconstruction helps estimate prognosis and protect healthcare workers from exposure to radioactive tissue and excreta 
* **MDS and Leukemia** are ***Chronic*** effects of radiation 
## Chemicals
* Benzene is notorious, usually used as solvent
* History of job exposure is important 
* Incidence of ***leukemia*** is correlated to ***cumulative exposure but susceptiblity*** is important 
* Usually ***not as a late exposure*** 

## Drugs 
* Chemotherapeutic drugs cause as major toxicity 
* Dose dependent usually 
* Idiosyncratic reactions usually occur ***without*** a dose response relationship 
* Association is not causation 
	* Drug may have been used to treat symptoms of [[Bone Marrow Failure]] like fever or viral illness 
	* May provoke 1st symptoms of disease 
* Idiosyncratic reactions are a rare event 
* ![[aplasticdrugs.png]]

## Infections 
* In many viral and bacterial infections 
* Usually ***mild and transient***

## Immunological Diseases 
* Major consequence and cause of death in ***Transfusion associated graft vs Host Disease (GVHD)*** 
* Occurs after infusion of nonirradiated blood products in immunodeficient patients 
* Associated with Eosinophilic Fascitis (collagen vascular disease) with painful subcutaneous induration 
* Thymoma and hypoimmunoglobulinemia 
* SLE 

## Hepatitis 
* 5% cases 
* Young men post recovery 1-2 months later 
* Severe pancytopenia 
* Seronegative hepatitis , presumed to be immune mediated

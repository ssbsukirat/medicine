# Definition 
ARDS is a clinical syndrome of 
* severe dyspnea of rapid onset
* diffuse pulmonary infiltrates
* hypoxemia
* Leading to respiratory failure

# Causes/Etiology of ARDS
![[ARDSetiology.PNG]]
## DIrect lung injury
* pneumonia
* gastric content aspiration
* contusion
* near drowning
* toxic inhalation

## inDirect lung injury
* Sepsis
* severe trauma 
* multiple transfusions
* Drug ODs
* pancreatitis
* post Cardiopulmonary bypass
* if trauma and APACHE II >_ 16 --> 2.5 fold increase risk
# Clinical course and pathophysiology
- 3 phases -- exudative, proliferative, fibrotic 
## Exudative phase 
- 1st 7 days (onset in 12-36h usually but maybe delayed upto 5-7 days)
- Signs symptoms
    - dyspnea
    - Rapid shallow breathing with inability to get enough air 
    - Tachypnea and increased work of breathing -- respiratory fatigue and failure
    - Nonspecific laboratory findings
    - Chest x-ray suggest pulmonary edema involving atleast 3/4 lung field (indistinguishable from cardiogenic pulmonary edema)
    - No cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or pulmonary vascular redistribution as in cardiogenic
    - Do 2D-ECHO to exclude cardiogenic cause if no ARDS risk factors
    - CT chest -- bilateral pulmonary infiltrate with extensive heterogeneity in lung involvement
- Differential
    - cardiogenic pulmonary edema
    - Bilateral pneumonia
    - Alveolar hemorrhage
    - Acute ILD (interstitial pneumonitis)
    - Acute immunological injury (HSP)
    - Toxin injury like radiation pneumonitis
    - Neurogenic pulmonary edema
- alveolar capillary endothelial cell and type 1 pneumocytes injured
- Loss of normally tight alveolar Barrier to fluid and macromolecules
- Protein rich fluid in interstitial and alveolar spaces 
- IL-1, IL8, TNF-ALPHA, leukotriene B4 increased 
- Condensed plasma proteins in air spaces with cellular debris and dysfunctional pulmonary surfactant -- hyaline membrane whorls 
- early pulmonary vascular injury with obliteration by microthrombi and fibrocellular proliferation
- Alveolar edema predominantly in dependant portions with reduced aeration -- collapse of dependent portion -- decreased lung compliance -- intrapulmonary shunting and hypoxemia -- dyspnea -- exacerbated by reduced pulmonary artery flow to ventilated segments (blocked by microthrombi) -- may have hypercapnia due to pulmonary dead space increase in early ARDS 
## Proliferative phase 
- day 7-21 
- Rapid recovery and off mechanical ventilation 
- Dyspnea tachypnea hypoxemia perists 
- Some have progressive lung injury and early pulmonary fibrosis
- Histological evidence of repair -- organisation of alveolar exudate , neutrophilic to lymphocytic infiltrate
- Type 2 pneumocytes proliferate -- differentiate into type 1 and also synthesise surfactant
## Fibrotic phas
- 3-4 weeks later patients usually recover lung function
- Some have fibrotic phase needing ventilation or supplemental oxygen 
- Alveolar edema and exudate -- alveolar duct and interstitial fibrosis
- Acinar architecture disruption -- emphysematous changes with large bullae

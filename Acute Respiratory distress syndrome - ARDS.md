# Definition 
ARDS is a clinical syndrome of 
* severe dyspnea of rapid onset
* diffuse pulmonary infiltrates
* hypoxemia
* Leading to respiratory failure

# Causes/Etiology of ARDS
![[ARDSetiology.PNG]]
## DIrect lung injury
* pneumonia
* gastric content aspiration
* contusion
* near drowning
* toxic inhalation

## inDirect lung injury
* Sepsis
* severe trauma 
* multiple transfusions
* Drug ODs
* pancreatitis
* post Cardiopulmonary bypass
* if trauma and APACHE II >_ 16 --> 2.5 fold increase risk
# Clinical course and pathophysiology
- 3 phases -- exudative, proliferative, fibrotic 
## Exudative phase 
- 1st 7 days ()
- alveolar capillary endothelial cell and type 1 pneumocytes injured
- Loss of normally tight alveolar Barrier to fluid and macromolecules
- Protein rich fluid in interstitial and alveolar spaces 
- IL-1, IL8, TNF-ALPHA, leukotriene B4 increased 
- Condensed plasma proteins in air spaces with cellular debris and dysfunctional pulmonary surfactant -- hyaline membrane whorls 
- early pulmonary vascular injury with obliteration by microthrombi and fibrocellular proliferation
- Alveolar edema predominantly in dependant portions with reduced aeration -- collapse of dependent portion -- decreased lung compliance -- intrapulmonary shunting and hypoxemia -- dyspnea -- exacerbated by reduced pulmonary artery flow to ventilated segments (blocked by microthrombi) -- may have hypercapnia due to pulmonary dead space increase in early ARDS

# Definition 
ARDS is a clinical syndrome of 
* severe dyspnea of rapid onset
* diffuse pulmonary infiltrates
* hypoxemia
* Leading to respiratory failure

# Causes/Etiology of ARDS
![[ARDSetiology.PNG]]
## DIrect lung injury
* pneumonia
* gastric content aspiration
* contusion
* near drowning
* toxic inhalation

## inDirect lung injury
* Sepsis
* severe trauma 
* multiple transfusions
* Drug ODs
* pancreatitis
* post Cardiopulmonary bypass
* if trauma and APACHE II >_ 16 --> 2.5 fold increase risk
# Clinical course and pathophysiology
- 3 phases -- exudative, proliferative, fibrotic 
## Exudative phase 
- 1st 7 days (onset in 12-36h usually but maybe delayed upto 5-7 days)
- Signs symptoms
    - dyspnea
    - Rapid shallow breathing with inability to get enough air 
    - Tachypnea and increased work of breathing -- respiratory fatigue and failure
    - Nonspecific laboratory findings
    - Chest x-ray suggest pulmonary edema involving atleast 3/4 lung field (indistinguishable from cardiogenic pulmonary edema)
    - No cardiomegaly, pleural effusion or pulmonary vascular redistribution as in cardiogenic
    - Do 2D-ECHO to exclude cardiogenic cause if no ARDS risk factors
    - CT chest -- bilateral pulmonary infiltrate with extensive heterogeneity in lung involvement
- Differential
    - cardiogenic pulmonary edema
    - Bilateral pneumonia
    - Alveolar hemorrhage
    - Acute ILD (interstitial pneumonitis)
    - Acute immunological injury (HSP)
    - Toxin injury like radiation pneumonitis
    - Neurogenic pulmonary edema
- alveolar capillary endothelial cell and type 1 pneumocytes injured
- Loss of normally tight alveolar Barrier to fluid and macromolecules
- Protein rich fluid in interstitial and alveolar spaces 
- IL-1, IL8, TNF-ALPHA, leukotriene B4 increased 
- Condensed plasma proteins in air spaces with cellular debris and dysfunctional pulmonary surfactant -- hyaline membrane whorls 
- early pulmonary vascular injury with obliteration by microthrombi and fibrocellular proliferation
- Alveolar edema predominantly in dependant portions with reduced aeration -- collapse of dependent portion -- decreased lung compliance -- intrapulmonary shunting and hypoxemia -- dyspnea -- exacerbated by reduced pulmonary artery flow to ventilated segments (blocked by microthrombi) -- may have hypercapnia due to pulmonary dead space increase in early ARDS 
## Proliferative phase 
- day 7-21 
- Rapid recovery and off mechanical ventilation 
- Dyspnea tachypnea hypoxemia perists 
- Some have progressive lung injury and early pulmonary fibrosis
- Histological evidence of repair -- organisation of alveolar exudate , neutrophilic to lymphocytic infiltrate
- Type 2 pneumocytes proliferate -- differentiate into type 1 and also synthesise surfactant
## Fibrotic phas
- 3-4 weeks later patients usually recover lung function
- Some have fibrotic phase needing ventilation or supplemental oxygen 
- Alveolar edema and exudate -- alveolar duct and interstitial fibrosis
- Acinar architecture disruption -- emphysematous changes with large bullae 
- Intimal fibroproliferation -- progressive vascular occlusion and pulmonary hypertension
- Increased risk of pneumothorax, reduced lung compliance, increased pulmonary dead space 
- Poor prognosis
# Treatment
- general
    - recognise and treat underlying disorder
    - Minimise unnecessary procedures
    - Bundled care approach in ICU 
    - Nosocomial infection prevention
    - Nutrition
## Mechanical ventilation
- Minimise ventilator induced lung injury
    - **Volutrauma** from repeated overdistention of alveoli due to excess tidal volume or **atelectrauma** from recurrent alveolar collapse
    - Injury more in high tidal volume modes 
    - Low tidal volume 6ml/kg of predicted body weight should be used  
    - Low plateau pressure <30 cm H2O 
- Minimise atelectrauma
    - use PEEP to minimise Fio2 and provide adequate Pao2 
    - PEEP-Fio2 charts can be used to find best settings
    - Static pressure volume curve can be generated and set PEEP just above inflection point 
    - Maximise respiratory system compliance
    - Measure esophageal pressure to eliminate transpulmonary pressure
- Prone positioning
    - mortality benefits in severe ARDS 
    - Needs critical care team already experienced in proning 
- Other strategies
    - **Recruitment maneuvers** to recruit atelectatic lung but may increase mortality in higher baseline PEEP
    - Alternate modes of ventilation like **airway pressure release ventilation and HFO ventilation** 
    - ECMO as  rescue therapy in ARDS
- Fluid management
     - maintain low left atrial pressures
         - Minimise pulmonary edema
         - Prevent further decrement in arterial oxygenation and lung compliance
         - Improved pulmonary mechanics
         - Shortens ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation
     - Aggressively reduce left side pressure with fluid restriction and diuretic limited by hypotension and hypoperfusion of organs like kidneys 
 - Neuromuscular blockade
     - sedation alone maybe ineffective for patient-ventilator synchronisation
     - Early neuromuscular blockade has mortality benefit in severe ARDS with asynchrony 
 - Glucocorticoids
     - many studies done 
     - Inconclusive
     - Routine use not recommended
     - Only specific conditions
 - Other therapies
     - surfactant replacement not useful
     - Inhaled NO and inhaled epoprostenol sodium transiently

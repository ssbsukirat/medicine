- Inflammation or fibrosis of renal interstitium & atrophy of tubular compartments -- secondary to glomerular or vascular disease or maybe primary 
- Acute vs CHRONIC 
- Acute -- AKI mostly 
	- aggressive inflammatory infiltrates --> tissue edema, tubular cell injury , compromised tubular flow, frank obstruction of tubules by cast, debris, crystal 
	- flank pain some time d/t capsule distension 
	- active sediment with leucocyte and cellular casts 
- CHRONIC 
	- indolent 
	- polyuria d/t impaired concentrating ability (nephrogenic DI) 
	- Defective PCT -- Fanconi syndrome -- glycosuria , aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, type 2 RTA d/t HCO3 losses 
	- NAGMA and Hyperkalemia -- type 4 RTA 
	- progressive azotemia 
	- modest proteinuria <2g/day 
	- FSGS - Nephrotic range proteinuria 
	- pathology in chronic TIN is interstitial fibrosis with patchy mononuclear cell infiltration and widespread tubular atrophy, luminal dilation, and thickening of tubular basement membranes. 
# Acute Interstitial Nephritis 
- Councilman - **an acute inflammation of the kidney characterized by cellular and fluid exudation in the interstitial tissue, accompanied by, but not dependent on, degeneration of the epithelium; the exudation is not purulent in character, and the lesions may be both diffuse and focal.** 
- today mostly allergic reaction to drug 
- immune mediated in autoimmune disease 
## Allergic Interstitial Nephritis 
- Clinical 
	- Fever, Rash, peripheral Eosinophilia, oliguric AKI 7-10 days after methicillin or beta-lactams is classic but rarely seen 
	- mostly incidentally rising creatinine or symptoms of AKI 
	- Atypical - **NSAID-induced AIN** - fever, rash, eosinophilia rare but **AKI + heavy proteinuria**
	- severe and **rapid-onset AIN may occur upon reintroduction of rifampin** after a drug-free period
	- PPI, sulfonamide , 5-ASA (mesalazine, sulfasalazine), antiretroviral 
- Diagnosis 
	- unexplained AKI + exposure to potentially offending drug 
	- eosinophilia adds to evidence but only in minority 
	- Urinalysis reveals **pyuria with white blood cell casts and hematuria.** 
	- **Urinary eosinophils are neither sensitive nor specific for AIN; therefore, testing is not recommended** 
	- biopsy not needed for diagnosis -- extensive interstitial and tubular infiltration of leucocytes and eosinophil 
- TREATMENT 
	- discontinue drug 
	- ![[AINtreatment.png]]
	- Glucocorticoid -- accelerate recovery but no impact on long-term kidney survival 
		- cases with severe kidney injury in which dialysis is imminent or if kidney function continues to deteriorate despite stopping the offending drug 
		- ![[AINsteroids.png]]
## Sjogrens 
- systemic autoimmune disorder 
- exocrine glands, especially the lacrimal and salivary glands, and thus results in symptoms, such as dry eyes and mouth, that constitute the “sicca syndrome” 
- TIN with lymphocytic infiltration m/c 
- maybe a/w impaired renal function , distal RTA, nephrogenic DI 
- anti-Ro, anti-La + support diagnosis 
- polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia 
- Glucocorticoid + maintainence with azathioprine / MMF to prevent relapse 
## TINU - Tubulointerstitial Nephritis with Uveitis 
- systemic autoimmune disorder of unknown ETIOLOGY 
- F:M 3:1 
- age ~ 15years 
- lymphocytic predominant interstitial nephritis + painful anterior uveitis (bilateral mostly ) + blurred vision/ photophobia 
- ocular before renal in only 1/3 
- extrarenal 
	- fever 
	- anorexia 
	- weight loss 
	- abdominal pain 
	- arthralgia 
- renal - 
	- elevated creatinine 
	- sterile pyuria 
	- mild proteinuria 
	- Fanconis 
	- hihg ESR 
- diagnosis of exclusion 
	- Sjogrens 
	- SLE 
	- sarcoidosis 
- oral glucocorticoid 
- maintainence with methotrexate , azathioprine , MMF 
## SLE 
- Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory 
- a/w glomerular lesion in class III or IV lupus nephritis 
- Occasionally, however, the tubulointerstitial inflammation predominates and may manifest with azotemia and type IV RTA rather than features of glomerulonephritis.
## Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis 
- AIN with protracted and relapsing course 
- Biopsy - CHRONIC inflammatory infiltrate with granulomas and multinucleated giant cells 
- most have no cause 
- some of these cases may have or subsequently develop the pulmonary, cutaneous, or other systemic manifestations of **sarcoidosis** such as hypercalcemia
- early glucocorticoid give some improvement 
- immunosuppression if relapse while tapering steroids 
- r/o TB 
## IgG4 related systemic disease 
- dense inflammatory infiltrate containing IgG4-expressing plasma cells can occur as a part of a syndrome known as **IgG4-related systemic disease** 
- Autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and a chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (mimicking Sjögren’s syndrome) may variably be present as well 
- inflammatory infiltrates --> fibrotic pseudotumours 
- glucocorticoid DOC 
## AIN d/t Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors 
- increase incidence of autoimmune phenomena 
- mostly dermatologic, GI, endocrine , renal in 2% 
- acute rise in serum creatinine is typically noted within 15 weeks after starting therapy, although it can occur later during therapy or up to 2 months following the final dose 
- biopsy - acute interstitial inflammation, although glomerular pathologies may also be found
- severe AKI -- corticosteroid , discontinue drug & avoid till renal function improves 
## Idiopathic AIN 
- no evidence of drug exposure or clinical or serology of autoimmune disease 
- responsive to glucocorticoid therapy but may follow a relapsing course requiring maintenance treatment with another immunosuppressive agent 
- Antibody to target antigen of CD or PCT brush border 
## Infection Associated AIN 
- differentiate from pyelonephritis 
- pyelonephritis doesnt cause AKI unless bilateral or septic shock 
- seen in immunocompromised especially renal transplant recipient with polyomavirus BK reactivation 
## Crystal Deposition 
- AKI + flank pain (d/t tubular obstruction) -- 
	- sulfadiazine for toxoplasmosis -- **"sheaf of wheat" crystal** 
	- indinavir and atazanavir for HIV - **individual or parallel clusters of needle-shaped crystal** 
	- IV acyclovir for herpes -- **red-green birefringent needle-shaped crystals**
- precipitated by hypovolemia and is reversible with saline volume repletion and drug withdrawal 
- **Acute Urate nephropathy** 
	- tubular obstruction 
	- severe hyperuricemia in tumour lysis syndrome (lympho or myeloproliferative disorder -- post chemo)
	- dense **precipitate of birefringent uric acid crystals** is found in the urine, usually in association with microscopic or gross hematuria 
	- Prophylactic **allopurinol** reduces the risk of uric acid nephropathy but is of no benefit once tumor lysis has occurred 
	- increase tubular flow and solubility of uric acid with **alkaline diuresis** may be of some benefit; 
	- emergent treatment with **hemodialysis or rasburicase,** a recombinant urate oxidase, is usually required to rapidly lower uric acid levels and restore kidney function.
- calcium oxalate deposit in tubular cells and interstitium
	- Ethyleneglycol ingestion 
	- Enteric hyperoxaluria from ileal resection or small-bowel bypass 
	- hereditary hyperoxaluria 
- Acute Phosphate Nephropathy 
	- uncommon 
	- serious 
	- oral phosphosoda in laxative or bowel preparation 
## Light Chain Cast Nephropathy 
- multiple myeloma --> AKI --> setting 
	- hypovolemia,
	- infection, or
	- hypercalcemia or 
	- after exposure to NSAIDs or 
	- radiographic contrast media.
- aka Myeloma Kidney 
- filtered monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (Bence-Jones proteins) form intratubular aggregates with secreted Tamm-Horsfall protein in the distal tubule 
- Casts --> obstruct tubular flow, giant-cell or foreign body reaction --> tubular rupture --> interstitial fibrosis 
- Diagnosis 
	- anemia, bone pain, hypercalcemia , abnormal narrow anion gap (d/t hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia ) 
	- laboratory detection of increased amounts of protein in a spot urine specimen and a negative dipstick result are highly suggestive that the urine contains Bence-Jones protein. 
	- Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and for immunofixation for the detection and identification of a potential monoclonal band.
- TREATMENT 
	- correct precipitating FACTORS like hypovolemia , hypercalcemia 
	- discontinue potential nephrotoxic agents 
	- treat underlying plasma cell dyscrasia 
	- plamsmapheresis +/- 
## Lymphpomatous Infiltration of Kidney 
- by malignant B lymphos 
- usually an incidental finding. 
- may cause massive enlargement of the kidneys and oliguric acute kidney injury 
- high-dose glucocorticoid + chemotherapy 
- poor prognosis 
# Chronic Tubulointerstitial Disease 
- most often the result of renal ischemia or secondary to a primary glomerular disease 
- developmental anomalies or inherited diseases such as reflux nephropathy or sickle cell nephropathy and may not be recognized until adolescence or adulthood 
- deterioration prevented or slowed by treating glomerular hypertension
## VUR & Reflux Nephropathy 
- Reflux nephropathy is the consequence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or other urologic anomalies in early childhood. 
- previously called chronic pyelonephritis because it was believed to result from recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in childhood
- VUR 
	- abnormal retrograde urine flow from bladder into ureter or kidney 
	- sterile reflux -> impaired growth of kidney 
	- if + recurrent UTI --> patchy interstitial scarring + tubular atrophy 
	- loss of nephrons --> hypertrophy of remnant glomeruli --> secondary FSGS 
	- adults are frequently asymptomatic but may give a history of prolonged bed-wetting or recurrent UTIs during childhood and may exhibit variable degrees of kidney injury as well as **hypertension, mild to moderate proteinuria, and an unremarkable urine sediment**  
	- If both involving -- ESRD 
	- if single kidney -- hypertension 
	- TREATMENT 
		- maintain sterile urine 
		- surgical reimplantation of ureter 
		- ACE/ARB for aggressive BP control and proteinuria control 
## Sickle Cell Nephropathy 
- polyuria 
- type 4 RTA 
- secondary FSGS 
- treat with los-dose ACE inhibitors 
- may cause papillary necrosis 
## Glomerulonephritis associated 
- sometimes d/t same process affecting glomerular and  tubulointerstitial 
- d/t secondary consequence of prolonged glomerular dysfunction 
	- proteinuria mediated tubular damage 
	- cytokine and complement mediated tubular cell activation 
	- reduced peritubular blood flow --> downstream tubulointerstitial ischemia 
## Analgesic Nephropathy 
- d/t phenacetin, aspirin caffeine 
- Impaired kidney function , papillary necrosis , small scarred kidneys with papillary calcification on CT 
- Polyuria & NAGMA 
- sloughed necrotic papillary --> ureteral obstruction -->  gross hematuria and ureteric colic 
- increased risk of urothelial malignancy 
- volume-depleted individuals and those with chronic kidney disease are at higher risk of NSAID-related renal toxicity 
## Aristolochic Acid Nephropathy 
- Chinese herbal medicine and Balkan endemic nephropathy 
- aristolochic acid is known carcinogenic 
- renal interstitial fibrosis with a relative paucity of cellular infiltrates 
- bland urinary sediment -- rare leucocyte and mild proteinuria 
- Anemia may be disproportionately severe relative to the level of kidney dysfunction 
- Definitive diagnosis 2/3
	- histology on biopsy 
	- confirmed aristolochic acid ingestion 
	- detection of aristolactam-DNA adducts 
- AAN is associated with a very high incidence of upper urinary tract urothelial cancers, with risk related to cumulative dose 
- surveillance with CT, ureteroscopy, urine cytology 
- if esrd - bilateral nephroureterectomy 
## Karyomegalic 
- slowly progressive CKS 
- mild proteinuria , interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy 
- oddly enlarged nuclei of proximal tubular epithelial cells 
- FAN1 mutation 
## Lithium 
- most common of which is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus manifesting as polyuria and polydipsia 
- accumulation in principal cells of CD by entering via ENaC channel 
- chronic TIN develops after prolonged (>10–20 years) lithium use 
- more in patients who have experienced repeated episodes of toxic lithium levels 
- biopsy 
	- interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy that are out of proportion to the degree of glomerulosclerosis or vascular disease,
	- a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate, and 
	- small cysts or dilation of the distal tubule and collecting duct that are highly characteristic of this disorder
- duration and dose proportional to degree of interstitial Fibrosis  
- asymptomatic 
- minimal proteinuria 
- normal BP 
- few leucocyte on urine 
- TREATMENT 
	- regular KFT 
	- cautious use in CKD 
	- amiloride to inhibit lithium entry via ENaC 
	- discontinue if nephropathy detected -- but problematic as good alternate to lithium not available 
	- CKD maybe irreversible and slow progress to ESRD 
	- monitor lithium levels and avoid toxic levels <1meq/l 
## Calcineurin Inhibitors Nephrotoxicity 
- Cyclosporine , Tacrolimus may cause AKI , CKD 
- AKI 
	- vasoconstriction 
	- development of thrombotic microangiopathy 
	- toxic tubulopathy 
- CKD 
	- solid organ transplant recipient 
	- slow, irreversible reduction of GFR 
	- mild proteinuria 
	- arterial hypertension 
- Hyperkalemia common d/t tubular resistance to aldosterone ]
- histology -- **striped** pattern

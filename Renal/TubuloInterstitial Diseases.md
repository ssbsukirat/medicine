- Inflammation or fibrosis of renal interstitium & atrophy of tubular compartments -- secondary to glomerular or vascular disease or maybe primary 
- Acute vs CHRONIC 
- Acute -- AKI mostly 
	- aggressive inflammatory infiltrates --> tissue edema, tubular cell injury , compromised tubular flow, frank obstruction of tubules by cast, debris, crystal 
	- flank pain some time d/t capsule distension 
	- active sediment with leucocyte and cellular casts 
- CHRONIC 
	- indolent 
	- polyuria d/t impaired concentrating ability (nephrogenic DI) 
	- Defective PCT -- Fanconi syndrome -- glycosuria , aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, type 2 RTA d/t HCO3 losses 
	- NAGMA and Hyperkalemia -- type 4 RTA 
	- progressive azotemia 
	- modest proteinuria <2g/day 
	- FSGS - Nephrotic range proteinuria 
	- pathology in chronic TIN is interstitial fibrosis with patchy mononuclear cell infiltration and widespread tubular atrophy, luminal dilation, and thickening of tubular basement membranes. 
# Acute Interstitial Nephritis 
- Councilman - **an acute inflammation of the kidney characterized by cellular and fluid exudation in the interstitial tissue, accompanied by, but not dependent on, degeneration of the epithelium; the exudation is not purulent in character, and the lesions may be both diffuse and focal.** 
- today mostly allergic reaction to drug 
- immune mediated in autoimmune disease 
## Allergic Interstitial Nephritis 
- Clinical 
	- Fever, Rash, peripheral Eosinophilia, oliguric AKI 7-10 days after methicillin or beta-lactams is classic but rarely seen 
	- mostly incidentally rising creatinine or symptoms of AKI 
	- Atypical - **NSAID-induced AIN** - fever, rash, eosinophilia rare but **AKI + heavy proteinuria**
	- severe and **rapid-onset AIN may occur upon reintroduction of rifampin** after a drug-free period
	- PPI, sulfonamide , 5-ASA (mesalazine, sulfasalazine), antiretroviral 
- Diagnosis 
	- unexplained AKI + exposure to potentially offending drug 
	- eosinophilia adds to evidence but only in minority 
	- Urinalysis reveals **pyuria with white blood cell casts and hematuria.** 
	- **Urinary eosinophils are neither sensitive nor specific for AIN; therefore, testing is not recommended** 
	- biopsy not needed for diagnosis -- extensive interstitial and tubular infiltration of leucocytes and eosinophil 
- TREATMENT 
	- discontinue drug 
	- ![[AINtreatment.png]]
	- Glucocorticoid -- accelerate recovery but no impact on long-term kidney survival 
		- cases with severe kidney injury in which dialysis is imminent or if kidney function continues to deteriorate despite stopping the offending drug 
		- ![[AINsteroids.png]]
## Sjogrens 
- systemic autoimmune disorder 
- exocrine glands, especially the lacrimal and salivary glands, and thus results in symptoms, such as dry eyes and mouth, that constitute the “sicca syndrome” 
- TIN with lymphocytic infiltration m/c 
- maybe a/w impaired renal function , distal RTA, nephrogenic DI 
- anti-Ro, anti-La + support diagnosis 
- polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia 
- Glucocorticoid + maintainence with azathioprine / MMF to prevent relapse 
## TINU - Tubulointerstitial Nephritis with Uveitis 
- systemic autoimmune disorder of unknown ETIOLOGY 
- F:M 3:1 
- age ~ 15years 
- lymphocytic predominant interstitial nephritis + painful anterior uveitis (bilateral mostly ) + blurred vision/ photophobia 
- ocular before renal in only 1/3 
- extrarenal 
	- fever 
	- anorexia 
	- weight loss 
	- abdominal pain 
	- arthralgia 
- renal - 
	- elevated creatinine 
	- sterile pyuria 
	- mild proteinuria 
	- Fanconis 
	- hihg ESR 
- diagnosis of exclusion 
	- Sjogrens 
	- SLE 
	- sarcoidosis 
- oral glucocorticoid 
- maintainence with methotrexate , azathioprine , MMF 
## SLE 
- Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory 
- a/w glomerular lesion in class III or IV lupus nephritis 
- Occasionally, however, the tubulointerstitial inflammation predominates and may manifest with azotemia and type IV RTA rather than features of glomerulonephritis.
## Granulomatous Interstitial Nephritis 
- AIN with protracted and relapsing course 
- Biopsy - CHRONIC inflammatory infiltrate with granulomas and multinucleated giant cells 
- most have no cause 
- some of these cases may have or subsequently develop the pulmonary, cutaneous, or other systemic manifestations of **sarcoidosis** such as hypercalcemia
- early glucocorticoid give some improvement 
- immunosuppression if relapse while tapering steroids 
- r/o TB 
## IgG4 related systemic disease 
- dense inflammatory infiltrate containing IgG4-expressing plasma cells can occur as a part of a syndrome known as **IgG4-related systemic disease** 
- Autoimmune pancreatitis, sclerosing cholangitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and a chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (mimicking Sjögren’s syndrome) may variably be present as well 
- inflammatory infiltrates --> fibrotic pseudotumours 
- glucocorticoid DOC 
## AIN d/t Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors 
- increase incidence of autoimmune phenomena 
- mostly dermatologic, GI, endocrine , renal in 2% 
- acute rise in serum creatinine is typically noted within 15 weeks after starting therapy, although it can occur later during therapy or up to 2 months following the final dose 
- biopsy - acute interstitial inflammation, although glomerular pathologies may also be found
- severe AKI -- corticosteroid , discontinue drug & avoid till renal function improves 
## Idiopathic AIN 
- no evidence of drug exposure or clinical or serology of autoimmune disease 
- responsive to glucocorticoid therapy but may follow a relapsing course requiring maintenance treatment with another immunosuppressive agent 
- Antibody to target antigen of CD or PCT brush border 
## Infection Associated AIN 
- differentiate from pyelonephritis 
- pyelonephritis doesnt cause AKI unless bilateral or septic shock 
- seen in immunocompromised especially renal transplant recipient with polyomavirus BK reactivation 
## Crystal Deposition 
- AKI + flank pain (d/t tubular obstruction) -- 
	- sulfadiazine for toxoplasmosis -- **"sheaf of wheat" crystal** 
	- indinavir and atazanavir for HIV - **individual or parallel clusters of needle-shaped crystal** 
	- IV acyclovir for herpes -- **red-green birefringent needle-shaped crystals**
- precipitated by hypovolemia and is reversible with saline volume repletion and drug withdrawal 
- **Acute Urate nephropathy** 
	- tubular obstruction 
	- severe hyperuricemia in tumour lysis syndrome (lympho or myelopro)

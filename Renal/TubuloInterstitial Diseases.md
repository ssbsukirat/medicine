- Inflammation or fibrosis of renal interstitium & atrophy of tubular compartments -- secondary to glomerular or vascular disease or maybe primary 
- Acute vs CHRONIC 
- Acute -- AKI mostly 
	- aggressive inflammatory infiltrates --> tissue edema, tubular cell injury , compromised tubular flow, frank obstruction of tubules by cast, debris, crystal 
	- flank pain some time d/t capsule distension 
	- active sediment with leucocyte and cellular casts 
- CHRONIC 
	- indolent 
	- polyuria d/t impaired concentrating ability (nephrogenic DI) 
	- Defective PCT -- Fanconi syndrome -- glycosuria , aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, type 2 RTA d/t HCO3 losses 
	- NAGMA and Hyperkalemia -- type 4 RTA 
	- progressive azotemia 
	- modest proteinuria <2g/day 
	- FSGS - Nephrotic range proteinuria 
	- pathology in chronic TIN is interstitial fibrosis with patchy mononuclear cell infiltration and widespread tubular atrophy, luminal dilation, and thickening of tubular basement membranes.

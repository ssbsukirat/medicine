- Inflammation or fibrosis of renal interstitium & atrophy of tubular compartments -- secondary to glomerular or vascular disease or maybe primary 
- Acute vs CHRONIC 
- Acute -- AKI mostly 
	- aggressive inflammatory infiltrates --> tissue edema, tubular cell injury , compromised tubular flow, frank obstruction of tubules by cast, debris, crystal 
	- flank pain some time d/t capsule distension 
	- active sediment with leucocyte and cellular casts 
- CHRONIC 
	- indolent 
	- polyuria d/t impaired concentrating ability (nephrogenic DI) 
	- Defective PCT -- Fanconi syndrome -- glycosuria , aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, type 2 RTA d/t HCO3 losses 
	- NAGMA and Hyperkalemia -- type 4 RTA 
	- progressive azotemia 
	- modest proteinuria <2g/day 
	- FSGS - Nephrotic range proteinuria 
	- pathology in chronic TIN is interstitial fibrosis with patchy mononuclear cell infiltration and widespread tubular atrophy, luminal dilation, and thickening of tubular basement membranes. 
# Acute Interstitial Nephritis 
- Councilman - **an acute inflammation of the kidney characterized by cellular and fluid exudation in the interstitial tissue, accompanied by, but not dependent on, degeneration of the epithelium; the exudation is not purulent in character, and the lesions may be both diffuse and focal.** 
- today mostly allergic reaction to drug 
- immune mediated in autoimmune disease 
## Allergic Interstitial Nephritis 
- Clinical 
	- Fever, Rash, peripheral Eosinophilia, oliguric AKI 7-10 days after methicillin or beta-lactams is classic but rarely seen 
	- mostly incidentally rising creatinine or symptoms of AKI 
	- Atypical - **NSAID-induced AIN** - fever, rash, eosinophilia rare but **AKI + heavy proteinuria**
	- severe and **rapid-onset AIN may occur upon reintroduction of rifampin** after a drug-free period
	- PPI, sulfonamide , 5-ASA (mesalazine)

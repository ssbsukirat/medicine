# Thrombotic Microangiopathy 
- endothelial cell injury in the terminal arterioles and capillaries. 
- Platelet and hyaline thrombi causing partial or complete occlusion 
- a/w Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia MAHA --> thrombocytopenia , schistocytes 
- swollen endocapillary cells, fibrin thrombi, platelet plugs, arterial intimal fibrosis , membranoproliferative pattern of glomerular 
- sometime --> glomerular collapse , cortical necrosis 
- on recovery --> secondary FSGS in some 
- a/w 
	- TTP,
	- HUS, 
	- malignant hypertension 
	- scleroderma renal crisis 
	- APLA 
	- preeclampsia / HELLP 
	- HIV 
	- radiation nephropathy 
	- Myeloproliferative neoplasm associated nephropathy 
	- POEMS -- polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin 
## HUS / TTP 
- prototypes for MAHA 
- TTP - adults, neurological complication 
- HUS - children, a/w hemorrhagic diarrhea 
- HUS 
	- MAHA + renal impairment 
	- variant 
		- STEC - HUS (shiga toxin producing E coli) -- aka D+HUS (diarrhea associated HUS) aka EHEC HUS 
			- children <5y , sometime adult 
			- diarrhea , hemorrhagic , before MAHA by 1 week 
			- Neurologic symptoms (dysphasia, hyperreflexia, blurred vision, memory deficits, encephalopathy, perseveration, and agraphia) often develop, especially in adults
			- [[Seizure]] , cerebral infarct in adult 
			- Stx1, Stx2 toxins aka verotoxins 
			- O157:H7 mc strain 
		- aHUS (atypical HUS) aka Complement Mediated HUS 
			- complement dysregulation 
			- congenital / acquired 
			- low C3, normal C4 
			- factor H deficiency in familial cases 
		- DEAP (deficiency of CFHR plasma proteins and CFH autoantibody positive) HUS 
			- autoimmune variant of aHUS 
			- antibody to factor H 
- TTP 
	- MAHA + Thrombocytopenia + neurological + fever + renal failure 
	- accumulation of ultra-large multimers of von Willebrand factor as a result of the absence or markedly decreased activity of the plasma protease ADAMTS13
	- additional inflammatory trigger (such as infection, surgery, pancreatitis, or pregnancy) is required to initiate clinical TTP 
	- maybe cTTP (congenital ), iTTP (acquired ) 
	- cTTP - Upshaw-Schulman syndrome 
		- congenital deficiency of ADAMTS13 
		- may present in 1st few weeks or in adults, especially pregnancy 
		- Plasma Transfusion 
- Drug Induced TMA 
	- chemotherapy , immunosuppresants , quinine  
	- dose dependent if toxic damage to endothelial cells -- proteasome inhibitors , mitomycin C, gemcitabine 
	- dose independent if drug-induced antibody - quinine 
- TREATMENT 
	- iTTP and DEAP HUS 
		- respond to the combination of plasma exchange and prednisone 
		- Twice- daily plasma exchanges with administration of rituximab may be effective in refractory cases 
		- Caplacizumab binds to the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor, blocking its interaction with platelets
	- cTTP - plasma infusion 
	- aHUS - plasma infusion / exchange 
		- Eculizumab - anti C5 antibody 
		- ravulizumab anti-C5
	- Neuraminidase associated HUS 
		- antibiotic 
		- washed RBCs 
		- plasmapheresis 
	- Drug-Induced TMA 
		- discontinue agent 
		- C5 inhibitors if refractory
	- STEC HUS 
		- supportive 
		- antimotility and antibiotic increase risk 
		- azithromycin reduces duration of shedding in adult 
## HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATIONâ€“ ASSOCIATED THROMBOTIC MICROANGIOPATHY 
- after allogenic HSCT ~8% 
- FACTORS 
	- conditioning regime 
	- immunosuppression 
	- infection 
	- GVHD 
	- females 
	- HLA mismatch donor 
- in first 100 days 
- high mortality 
- Plasma exchange beneficial in <25% 
- Discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors and treatment of infections or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (if present) are recommended 
- eculizumab maybe useful 
- ![[HSCTtma.png]]
## HIV related Microangiopathy 
- before HAART, nowadays less 
- advanced AIDS, low CD4 counts 
- MAHA + thrombocytopenia + renal failure 
- renal biopsy needed for diagnosis 
- ADAMTS13 is normal 
- a/w CMV coinfection 
- HAART 
- plasma exchange in TTP 
## Radiation Nephropathy 
- local or total body 
- 4-5Gy exposure sufficient as kidney is radiosensitive 
- renal insufficiency + proteinuria + hypertension 
- >_ 6m of radiation 
- TMA + glomerular/tubular/vascular cell damage on biopsy 
- MAHA uncommon 
- Bone marrow transplant nephropathy as its a/w allogenic HSCT 
- RAAS blockage +/- therapy 
## Scleroderma 
- renal involvement in 52% with widespread scleroderma -- 20% have renal crisis 
- others 
	- AKI -
		- transient prerenal 
		- medication related -- D penicillamine , NSAID, cyclosporine 
- Scleroderma Renal Crisis 
	- 12% with diffuse SS, only 2% with limited systemic sclerosis 
	- most severe form of renal involvement 
	- accelerated hypertension + rapid decline in renal function + nephrotic range proteinuria + hematuria 
	- retinopathy , encephalopathy a/w hypertension 
	- pulmonary edema d/t salt and water retention 
	- cardiac -- myocarditis , pericarditis , arrhythmia -- poor prognosis 
	- MAHA in 50%, coagulopathy rare 
	- Lesion 
		- arcuate artery intimal and medial proliferation with luminal narrowing
		- **Onion skinning** 
		- +/- glomerular collapse 
		- similar to malignant hypertension 
	- RAAS blockage has improved mortality 
	- 2/3 need dialysis support 
	- anti-U3RNP a/w renal crisis 
	- anticentromere ab --> negative predictor 
	- renal biopsy needed, especially if hypertensive 
	- TREATMENT 
		- ACE inhibitors unless contraindicated 
		- **reduce SBP by 20mmhg, DBP by 10mmhg every 24h till normal** 
		- additional therapy if max dose of ACE inhibitors reaches 
		- ACE inhibitors are continued even after starting dialysis 
		- IV Iloprost for BP control 
		- Bosentan , eculizumab +/- 
## APLA 
- primary or secondary to SLE 
- predisposes to systemic thrombosis both arterial and venous 
- antibodies 
	- anti-cardiolipin IgG, IgM, IgA 
	- lupus anticoagulant 
	- anti-B2-glycoprotein 
- cardiolipin anti-B2-glycoprotein have highest risks of thrombosis 
- Vascular compartment is main site of involvement 
	- arteriolosclerosis in arcuate , intralobular arteries 
	- fibrous intimal hyperplasia + onion skinning in intralobular 
- TMA + but MAHA, platelet consumption rare 
- TMA m/c in catastrophic APLA 
- Large vessel involvement , renal vein thrombosis maybe seen (nephrotic range proteinuria ) 
- Hypertension + 
- TREATMENT is lifelong anticoagulant 
- glucocorticoid in accelerated hypertension 
- Immunosuppresants + plasma exchange in catastrophic APLA 
- rituximab 
- eculizumab 
## HELLP 
- Hemolysis + elevated liver enzyme + low platelet 
- 3rd trimester 
- a/w preeclampsia but may occur without 
- risk FACTORS 
	- abnormal placentation 
	- family history 
	- elevated fetal mRNA for FLT1 
- high inflammatory markers

# Thrombotic Microangiopathy 
- endothelial cell injury in the terminal arterioles and capillaries. 
- Platelet and hyaline thrombi causing partial or complete occlusion 
- a/w Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia MAHA --> thrombocytopenia , schistocytes 
- swollen endocapillary cells, fibrin thrombi, platelet plugs, arterial intimal fibrosis , membranoproliferative pattern of glomerular 
- sometime --> glomerular collapse , cortical necrosis 
- on recovery --> secondary FSGS in some 
- a/w 
	- TTP,
	- HUS, 
	- malignant hypertension 
	- scleroderma renal crisis 
	- APLA 
	- preeclampsia / HELLP 
	- HIV 
	- radiation nephropathy 
	- Myeloproliferative neoplasm associated nephropathy 
	- POEMS -- polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, skin 
## HUS / TTP 
- prototypes for MAHA 
- TTP - adults, neurological complication 
- HUS - children, a/w hemorrhagic diarrhea 
- HUS 
	- MAHA + renal impairment 
	- variant 
		- STEC - HUS (shiga toxin producing E coli) -- aka D+HUS (diarrhea associated HUS) aka EHEC HUS 
			- children <5y , sometime adult 
			- diarrhea , hemorrhagic , before MAHA by 1 week 
			- Neurologic symptoms (dysphasia, hyperreflexia, blurred vision, memory deficits, encephalopathy, perseveration, and agraphia) often develop, especially in adults
			- [[Seizure]] , cerebral infarct in adult 
			- Stx1, Stx2 toxins aka verotoxins 
			- O157:H7 mc strain 
		- aHUS (atypical HUS) aka Complement Mediated HUS 
			- complement dysregulation 
			- congenital / acquired 
			- low C3, normal C4 
			- factor H deficiency in familial cases 
		- DEAP (deficiency of CFHR plasma proteins and CFH autoantibody positive) HUS 
			- autoimmune variant of aHUS 
			- antibody to factor H 
- TTP 
	- MAHA + Thrombocytopenia + neurological + fever + renal failure 
	- accumulation of ultra-large multimers of von Willebrand factor as a result of the absence or markedly decreased activity of the plasma protease ADAMTS13
	- additional inflammatory trigger (such as infection, surgery, pancreatitis, or pregnancy) is required to initiate clinical TTP 
	- maybe cTTP (congenital ), iTTP (acquired ) 
	- cTTP - Upshaw-Schulman syndrome 
		- congenital deficiency of ADAMTS13 
		- may present in 1st few weeks or in adults, especially pregnancy 
		- Plasma Transfusion 
- Drug Induced TMA 
	- chemotherapy , immunosuppresants , quinine  
	- dose dependent if toxic damage to endothelial cells -- proteasome inhibitors , mitomycin C, gemcitabine 
	- dose independent if drug-induced antibody - quinine

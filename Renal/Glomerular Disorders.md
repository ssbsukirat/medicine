- glomerular capillary tuft, fed and drained by arterioles, represents an arteriolar portal system 
- glomerular capillaries filter 120-180L/day of plasma 
- large proteins and all cells are excluded from filtration by a physicochemical barrier governed by **pore size and negative electrostatic charge**
- normal nephrons excrete on average **8– 10 mg of albumin in daily voided urine**, ∼20–60% of total excreted protein. 
# PATHOGENESIS 
- GENETIC 
	- congenital nephrotic -- NPHS1(nephrin) , NPHS2 (podocin) 
	- FSGS -- TRPC6 
	- FSGS, ESRD -- APOL1 in African American 
	- complement pathway mutations -- MPGN, dense deposit disease , apthous 
	- Alports -- a3, a4, a5 chains of type IV collagen 
- Systemic hypertension , atherosclerosis 
	- pressure stress, ischemia, lipid oxidants --> **chronic glomerulosclerosis** 
	- malignant hypertension --> fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles, glomeruli 
- Diabetic Nephropathy --> acquired sclerotic injury associated with thickening of the GBM secondary to the long-standing effects of hyperglycemia

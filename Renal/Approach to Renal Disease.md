- Upper urinary tract --> kidney , vasculature , renal parenchyma , collecting system 
- Lower Urinary tract --> ureters, bladder, urethra 
- diseases primarily with glomerular dysfunction --> albuminuria 
- diseases that begin in the tubular structures--> electrolyte disorders or disorders of dilution and concentration of the urine
- glomerular diseases eventually affect the tubular interstitium and tubular diseases progress to glomerular dysfunction and scarring

- Cystinosis --> lysosomal storage disorder, childhood Fanconi syndrome 
	- 1st year of life --> dehydrated, salt wasting, poor feeding & growth 
		- polyuria, hypotension, and muscle weakness 
		- features of proximal tubular dysfunction 
		- Hypokalemic RTA. glycosuria, phosphaturia
		- lysosomal cystine accumulation --> PCT and interstitium destruction 
		- glomerular filtration near normal , minimal albumin in urine 
	- over a decade --> progressive scarring of capillaries 
		- albuminuria 
		- progressive decline in GFR 
		- K, HPO4 retention 
		- Metabolic acidosis

- Upper urinary tract --> kidney , vasculature , renal parenchyma , collecting system 
- Lower Urinary tract --> ureters, bladder, urethra 
- diseases primarily with glomerular dysfunction --> albuminuria 
- diseases that begin in the tubular structures--> electrolyte disorders or disorders of dilution and concentration of the urine
- glomerular diseases eventually affect the tubular interstitium and tubular diseases progress to glomerular dysfunction and scarring 
- ![[AKIapproach.png]]
- Cystinosis --> lysosomal storage disorder, childhood Fanconi syndrome 
	- photosensitivity related to highly refractile cystine crystals deposited in the cornea is very specific for cystinosis
	- 1st year of life --> dehydrated, salt wasting, poor feeding & growth 
		- polyuria, hypotension, and muscle weakness 
		- features of proximal tubular dysfunction 
		- Hypokalemic RTA. glycosuria, phosphaturia
		- lysosomal cystine accumulation --> PCT and interstitium destruction 
		- glomerular filtration near normal , minimal albumin in urine 
	- over a decade --> progressive scarring of capillaries 
		- albuminuria 
		- progressive decline in GFR 
		- K, HPO4 retention 
		- Metabolic acidosis --> from inability to form NH4 
		- Hypertension and edema from salt and water retention
		- Anemia as in CKD
		- Hepatomegaly at birth 
# Nephritic
- Inflammatory condition 
- a/w infection , allergy to medication , systemic autoimmune , toxic 
- inflammation + enlarged kidney --> point tender over flank and costovertebral-angle tenderness 
## Glomerulonephritis 
- hypertension, volume expansion, and an abnormal urinalysis 
- Volume expansion --> edema, hypertension 
	- ascites in children 
	- elderly --> restlessness and anxiety may be the first signs of incipient acute pulmonary edema 
	- orthopnea , Dyspnea on exertion +/- peripheral edema 
- acute --> 
	- oliguria 
	- low urinary sodium 
	- concentrated urine 
	- salt, water retention 
- Acute / subacute 
	- days or weeks 
	- postinfectious GN 
	- RPGN  
		- ![[RPGNcauses.png]]
	- biopsy -- inflammatory, proliferative, or necrotizing lesions in renal tissue
- CHRONIC 
	- month to years 
	- sclerotic and atrophic findings on renal biopsy 
- Urine analysis 
	- hematuria 
		- microscopic --> invisible to naked eye 
		- Macroscopic --> cola or tea coloured urine 
	- proteinuria 
	- cells, clumps of cells 
		- RBCs 
			- through breaks in glomerular BM 
			- Misshaped, Dysmorphic 
		- PMNs 
		- inflammatory cells 
	- cellular casts 
### Postinfectious GN
- complement mediatwd immune complex response to bacterial infection 10days to 3 weeks after infection 
	- specific nephritogenic strain of gp A streptococcal pharyngitis or impetigo 
- Antibiotic treatment not needed 
- Subacute bacterial endocarditis may cause 
- low C3 levels 
- infection associated GN 
	- during ongoing infection 
	- MRSA or Empyema 
	- antibiotic and drain abcess 
	- IgA and complement deposit 
- vs synpharyngitic hematuria 
	- gross hematuria 
	- as little as 10–20 mL of blood will turn a liter of urine red 
	- related to IgA nephropathy 
	- Normal C3 levels 
	- chronic microhematuria 
	- a/w celiac, RA, ANKYLOSING spondyltis 
### RPGN 
- ![[RPGNcauses.png]]
- proliferation of glomerular parietal epithelial cells and inflammatory cells called cellular crescents surrounding the capillary that, over time, becomes fibrotic and atrophic with global loss of the glomerular tuft 
- if >50% glomureli --> glomerular sclerosis 
- typical signs of the nephritic syndrome, + in pulmonary-renal syndromes, may present with hemoptysis, interstitial lung disease, epistaxis, or upper airway symptoms of sinusitis or nasal congestion.
- antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test, particularly those made up of antimyeloperoxidase (pANCA) or antiproteinase-3 antibodies (cANCA), is diagnostic for the pauci-immune disorders of systemic vasculitis 
- Granulomatous vasculitis (formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis associated with pulmonary and upper respiratory disease
- positive test for antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies -->
	- either renal-limited anti-GBM disease or, 
	- when associated with pulmonary hemorrhage, with Goodpasture disease (young males, heavy smokers, h/o hydrocarbon inhalation )
- Immune complex disease -->
	- **low C3** d/t high clearance of circulating complement with deposits in glomerular subendothelial space 
	- SLE, cryoglobulinemia may have pulmonary hemorrhage 
	- cryoglobulinemia - low C4 complement and a high rheumatoid factor, and the syndrome may be caused by paraproteinemias or hepatitis C 
	- crescentic RPGN but with normal C3 complement is a form of IgA vasculitis **(Henoch-Schonlein purpura),**
		- skin vasculitis characterized by palpable purpura, gastrointestinal bleeding, and arthralgias, and in the vasculitic form, pulmonary hemorrhage

### Tubulointerstitial Nephritis 
- Inflammatory disorder of renal tubules and interstitium --> infection , autoimmune , allergic immunologic response to drugs 
- ACUTE ALLERGIC AND IMMUNE INTERSTITIAL NEPHRITIS 
	- 1-2 weeks following exposure to offending drug 
	- rapid and potentially reversible loss of kidney function - follows change of dose or restarting previously used medication 
	- if NSAID / ampicillin --> glomerular proteinuria 
	- fever, rash, eosinophilia (eosinophilia in penicillin , FQs, Checkpoint inhibitors ) but eosinophilia atypical in NSAIDs 
	- Urinalysis -- Pyuria, eosinophiluria 
		- activated T lymphos, plasma

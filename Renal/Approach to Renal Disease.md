- Upper urinary tract --> kidney , vasculature , renal parenchyma , collecting system 
- Lower Urinary tract --> ureters, bladder, urethra 
- diseases primarily with glomerular dysfunction --> albuminuria 
- diseases that begin in the tubular structures--> electrolyte disorders or disorders of dilution and concentration of the urine
- glomerular diseases eventually affect the tubular interstitium and tubular diseases progress to glomerular dysfunction and scarring 
- ![[AKIapproach.png]]
- Cystinosis --> lysosomal storage disorder, childhood Fanconi syndrome 
	- photosensitivity related to highly refractile cystine crystals deposited in the cornea is very specific for cystinosis
	- 1st year of life --> dehydrated, salt wasting, poor feeding & growth 
		- polyuria, hypotension, and muscle weakness 
		- features of proximal tubular dysfunction 
		- Hypokalemic RTA. glycosuria, phosphaturia
		- lysosomal cystine accumulation --> PCT and interstitium destruction 
		- glomerular filtration near normal , minimal albumin in urine 
	- over a decade --> progressive scarring of capillaries 
		- albuminuria 
		- progressive decline in GFR 
		- K, HPO4 retention 
		- Metabolic acidosis --> from inability to form NH4 
		- Hypertension and edema from salt and water retention
		- Anemia as in CKD
		- Hepatomegaly at birth 
# Nephritic
- Inflammatory condition 
- a/w infection , allergy to medication , systemic autoimmune , toxic 
- inflammation + enlarged kidney --> point tender over flank and costovertebral-angle tenderness 
## Glomerulonephritis 
- hypertension, volume expansion, and an abnormal urinalysis 
- Volume expansion --> edema, hypertension 
	- ascites in children 
	- elderly --> restlessness and anxiety may be the first signs of incipient acute pulmonary edema 
	- orthopnea , Dyspnea on exertion +/- peripheral edema 
- acute --> 
	- oliguria 
	- low urinary sodium 
	- concentrated urine 
	- salt, water retention 
- Acute / subacute 
	- days or weeks 
	- postinfectious GN 
	- RPGN  
		- ![[RPGNcauses.png]]
	- biopsy -- inflammatory, proliferative, or necrotizing lesions in renal tissue
- CHRONIC 
	- month to years 
	- sclerotic and atrophic findings on renal biopsy 
- Urine analysis 
	- hematuria 
		- microscopic --> invisible to naked eye 
		- Macroscopic --> cola or tea coloured urine 
	- proteinuria 
	- cells, clumps of cells 
		- RBCs 
			- through breaks in glomerular BM 
			- Misshaped, Dysmorphic 
		- PMNs 
		- inflammatory cells 
	- cellular casts 
### Postinfectious GN
- complement mediatwd immune complex response to bacterial infection 10days to 3 weeks after infection 
	- specific nephritogenic strain of gp A streptococcal pharyngitis or impetigo 
- Antibiotic treatment not needed 
- Subacute bacterial endocarditis may cause 
- low C3 levels 
- infection associated GN 
	- during ongoing infection 
	- MRSA or Empyema 
	- antibiotic and drain abcess 
	- IgA and complement deposit 
- vs synpharyngitic hematuria 
	- gross hematuria 
	- as little as 10â€“20 mL of blood will turn a liter of urine red 
	- related to IgA nephropathy 
	- Normal C3 levels 
	- chronic microhematuria 
	- a/w celiac, RA, ANKYLOSING spondyltis

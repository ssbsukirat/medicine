- diagnosed clinically on the basis of the characteristic motor syndrome of bradykinesia accompanied by **resting tremor (predominant in 80% of patients)** , **rigidity and postural reflex impairment (20% of patients)**, all largely the result of dopaminergic dysfunction in the nigrostriatal system
- incidence rises with age, M:F 2:1 --> incidence rates range from 47 to 77 cases per 100,000 persons 45 years of age or older and from 108 to 212 cases per 100,000 persons 65 years of age or older.
- Multisystem neurologic disorder 
	- Motor Symptom 
	- Nonmotor symptoms
		- include sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, altered mood and affect, autonomic dysfunction (constipation, urogenital disorders, and orthostatic hypotension), and sensory symptoms (hyposmia and pain) 
		- hyposmia and rapid- eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, which is characterized by loss of normal atony during REM sleep and limb movements that simulate running or flailing — often predate the onset of motor symptoms by many years, which suggests that such **symptoms may be prodromal**
- Diagnostic Criteria -- UK brain Bank Criteria 
	- ![[The-United-Kingdom-Parkinsons-Disease-Society-Brain-Bank-clinical-diagnostic-criteria.png]]
	- visualization of the striatal dopamine system (mainly with the use of 123I-ioflupane single-photon-emission computed tomography [SPECT] or 18F-labeled fluorodopa positron-emission tomography) can differentiate between Parkinson’s disease and disorders such as essential tremor
	- Autopsy --> Intraneuronal accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein protein (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, collectively termed “Lewy pathology”) is present in up to 90% of clinically defined cases of Parkinson’s disease, selectively affecting brain-stem nuclei **(dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, locus coeruleus, and substantia nigra), the peripheral autonomic region (myenteric plexus, sympathetic ganglia, and skin autonomic nervous system), and the limbic and neo- cortical regions** 
- Etiology 
	- Genetic 
		- AD 
			- LRRK2 40% of genetic - PARK1
			- GBA1 5-15%, especially Ashkenazi Jewish 
			- VPS35 (PARK17) , SNCA(PARK4)
		- AR -- fewer nonmotor features and more prominent dystonia than the typical disorder
			- PARK2 - Parkin mutation 
			- PINK1 - PARK6 
			- DJ1- PARK7

	- Pesticide exposure - paraquat, rotenone, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, several organochlorines and OPs , chlorinated solvents 
	- higher dairy consumption and hepatochlor concentration (OP pesticide) 
	- repeated head injury 
	- metals, diabetes , inflammatory disorders, infection 
	- decreased risk with --> caffeine , cigarette and physical exercise 
- Natural History and Clinical Course 
	- Assymetric onset of slowness and tremor 
	- eventually bilateral rigidity , bradykinesia , tremor, gait and balance disorder 
	- Non motor features precede onset of motor symptom in most 
	- autonomic abnormalities, 
		- orthostatic hypotension, 
		- impaired gastro- intestinal motility, 
		- urinary dysfunction, 
		- erectile dysfunction, and 
		- impaired thermoregulation
	- Cognitive Decline 
		- visuospatial and executive dysfunction 
		- subjective 
		- 10% annually 
		- DLB -> hallucinations and parkinsonism with dementia 
- TREATMENT 
	- Regular exercise, a healthy diet, high-quality sleep, and avoidance of adverse exposures have been associated with reduced mortality 
	- No therapy definitely slows the progression of Parkinson’s disease 
	- Pharmacotherapy 
		- Levodopa 
			- oral 
			- mainstay 
			- converted to dopamine in CNS 
			- DOPA deoxycarboxylase and COMT metabolizes 
			- added with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa, benzeraside 
			- dose-related side effects include dyskinesia (hyperkinetic involuntary movements), development or worsening of hallucinations or behavioral problems, orthostatic hypotension, and nausea.
		- COMT inhibitor 
			- Entacapone / opicapone 
			- oral
			- wearing off episodes and motor fluctuation 
		- MAO-B 
			- block synaptic dopamine metabolism 
			- Selegiline , Rasagiline 
			- Safinamide - new drug for patients with motor fluctuation 
		- Dopamine Agonist 
			- Non ergot used 
			- Pramipexole , ropinirole 
			- rotigotine - transdermal skin patches 
			- Apomorphine - rapidly acting , IV, sc, nasal, transdermal preparation -- may use for acute motor fluctuation 
		- NMDA antagonist 
			- Amantadine - improves LD induced dyskinesia 
		- Adenosine A2A antagonist - Istradefylline for motor fluctuation 
		- Anticholinergic 
			- trihexyphenidyl , benztropine --> for drug induced parkinsonism 
	- Motor fluctuation 
		- Wearing Off - mc type 
		- On/Off 
		- Delayed on 
		- Dose failure 
	- Non Motor Symptom 
		- Dementia 
			- Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
			- Memantine 
		- Depression/ anxiety 
			- SSRIs - citalopram, escitalopram, parox- etine, fluoxetine, or sertraline
			- SNRIs - venlafaxine 
		- Hallucinations , Delusions 
			- Pimavenserin - 5-HT 2A/C inverse agonist and antagonist 
			- atypical antipsychotic - clozapine , quetiapine 
		- Orthostatic Hypotension 
			- salt and fluid 
			- fludrocortisone 
			- Midodrine 
			- Droxydopa 
		- Drooling can be managed with sub- lingual atropine drops or salivary-gland botuli- num toxin injections
		- Constipation - increased dietary fiber, stool softeners, or laxatives. 
- SURGICAL MANAGEMENT 
	- intracranial placement of thin leads (on one side or both sides of the brain), typically into the sub- thalamic nucleus or globus pallidus, which are connected through extension leads to a neuro- stimulator placed subcutaneously in the subclavicular region
	- improves the quality of life and alleviates motor fluctuations (average increase in “on” time, 3 to 4 hours a day 
	- subthalamic nucleus is most commonly targeted 
	- benefits persist upto 15 years 
	- Most nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (cognitive impairment, mood changes, apathy, and autonomic symptoms) and some motor symptoms (impaired balance and freezing of gait) typically do not improve with the use of DBS
	- Complications 
		- dyskinesia 
		- worsening of speech, gait, balance 
	- Older techniques involving direct lesioning with a heated probe (unilateral thalamotomy or pallidotomy) are now used only in rare cases. 
	- MRI- guided, high-frequency, focused ultrasonography targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus on one side is increasingly being used to treat tremor in patients with Parkinson’s disease, but this approach may have a limited benefit over time and does not treat other symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

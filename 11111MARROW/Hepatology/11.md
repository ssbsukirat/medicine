# HEPATITIS C

## Introduction

### Basics:
* Size: 50 nm.
* Family: Flaviviridae family.
* Genus: Hepacivirus genus.
* Genotypes: 7 in total.
* Genotype 3 is a/w bad prognosis, m/c type in India.
* Genotype la5077/64855b8b24bf3f1
* Envelope: Enveloped virus (E1 and E2 tetramers on lipid bilayer).
* Genetic structure: +ssRNA.
* Quasi-species: D/t errors in replication, escape immune response.

### Forms:
* Virions that are bound to VLDL, LDL: Lipoviral particle (Infective form).
* Virions bound to immunoglobulins.
* Free virions.

### Structure:
#### Envelope :
* E1 and E2 glycoproteins + host derived lipid membrane.
* E2 protein shields the E1.
* Embedded in the host derived lipid membranes (Cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin).

#### Capsid:
* made with core protein.
* Binds to RNA.

#### RNA genome:
* Genetic structure: +ssRNA.
* Nucleotide bases: 9,600 base pairs.
* Single open reading frame flanked by 5' and 3' UTR.
* 5': 4 domains out of which 2nd, 3rd & 4th part has internal ribosomal entry.

## Hybrid lipoviral particle
* Triglycerides, ApoB, ApoE + viral particle (makes it infective).
* Similar to LDL and VLDL (Steatosis is a hallmark of hepatitis C infection).

## Structural and non structural protein:

## Life cycle
### Stages:
1. **Binding:**
    * Low affinity binding to : LDL & heparan sulphate proteoglycans receptor.
    * E1, E2 binds to : SRBI & CD81.
    * HCV particle binds to tight junction.
2. **Endocytosis:**
    * CD8 + CLDNI.
    * Inward folding of viral particle in clathrin pit.
3. **Fusion and uncoating:**
    * Acidic pH in endosome → Fusion between membranes.
    * Endosomal fusion.
    * RNA release.
4. **Translation:**
    * HCV RNA + Ribosomes → Translation.
    * Polyprotein → 3000 AA.
5. **Proteolytic processing:**
    * Within rough endoplasmic reticulum.
    * Cellular protease cleaves structural proteins.
    * NS3 + NS4A protease complex cleaves non structural proteins.

## 3': Polyadenylated tail, switch between translation and transcription.

## Pathogenesis and diagnosis
### Pathogenesis theory:
1. Evasion of immune response.
2. Inadequate induction of the innate immune response.
3. Insufficient induction or maintenance of an adaptive immune response.
4. Production of viral quasispecies.
5. Induction of immunologic tolerance or exhaustion.

### Liver damage :
* Immune mediated (Except fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis).
* HCV: Binds to CD81 → Decreases NK cells (Effector cells of innate immune response).
* NS3/4 protease: Blocks interferon (IFN) pathway & thereby synthesis.
* Core protein: Inhibits transcription of IFN response genes.
* NSSA and E2: Blocks IFN response gene translation.

## Acute hepatitis C:
* HCV RNA: Seen within 1-3 weeks.
* ALT rise: 4 to 12 weeks.
* Symptoms: Non specific.
* Chronicity: 50-90%.
* Age and gender: Younger age and female gender has better prognosis.

## Chronic hepatitis C:
* 1st symptom: Decompensation.

## Others:
* Arthralgias.
* Paresthesias.
* Myalgias.
* Sicca syndrome.
* Nausea & anorexia.

## Diagnosis:
### Indirect assays:
* Enzyme immunoassay: 3rd generation.
* Antibodies for: HCV core, NS3, NS4 & NSS.
* Sensitivity and specificity at 7-8 weeks: 99%

### Direct assays:
* HCV RNA at 1-3 weeks (Gold standard).
* HCV core antigen assay (Cheaper).
* Only to confirm viremia.
* Genotyping: Direct sequencing of the NSSB or E1 (PCR), specific probes for reverse transcription of the 5' portion.

## Natural history:
* HCV infection → Continuous infection → Cirrhosis → HCC.
* Age and gender: Longer duration of infection → High chances of liver fibrosis (>40 years has a faster progression, 65yrs old → Cirrhosis).
* Females better prognosis.
* Genotype 3: Faster progression → Steatosis.
* Genotype 2: Acute flares.
* Viral load: No relation with fibrosis.
* Alcohol: Faster progression and coffee: Halts steatosis.

## Drugs used in Hepatitis C:
| Drug | Uses |
|---|---|
| Ribavirin (RBV). | • Oral guanosine analogue. <br> • Tha→ Thi immune response. <br> • Inhibits IMP dehydrogenase → Depletes GTP. <br> • Inhibits RNA dependent RNA polymerase. <br> • Inducts lethal mutagenesis in replication. |
| Pegylated interferon. | • PEG IFN-α2a : 180 µg. <br> • PEG IFN-α2b : 1.5 µg/kg. <br> • Genotype 1 duration : 48 weeks. <br> • Genotype 2 and 3 duration : 24 weeks. <br> • If SVR absent: No halting of the disease/HCC. |
| DAAs (Directly Acting Antivirals). | • HCV NS3/NS4A protease (previrs). <br> • HCV NSSA protein (asvirs). <br> • HCV NSSB polymerase (buvirs). <br> • For NS3/4A. <br> • used in geno 1 in combo with IFN and RBV. <br> • Genotype: Ib > Ia. <br> • In less advanced fibrosis stage. |

## Reduced responsiveness to DAA combination therapy:
* Genotype la less responsive than genotype Ib.
* Treatment experience.
* Advanced fibrosis.
* Reduced adherence.

## Treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis:
* No cirrhosis, no prior therapy, HCV+.
* Glecaprevir (300 mg)/Pibrentasvir (120 mg): 8 weeks.
* Sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg): 12 weeks.
* Issues: Hypoglycemia and warfarin interactions.
* SVR after 12 weeks of therapy.

## Treatment-Naive adults with compensated cirrhosis:
* Child A: Compensated cirrhosis CTP <7
* Cirrhosis: FB-4 >3.25/TE >12.5 kPa.
* Clinical and imaging features of cirrhosis
* Prior biopsy showing cirrhosis.
* Prior hepatitis C treatment.
* End stage renal disease.
* HIV or HBsAg positive.
* Current pregnancy.
* Hepatocellular carcinoma.
* Prior liver transplantation.
* Glecaprevir (300 mg)/Pibrentasvir (120 mg): 8 weeks.
* Sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg): 12 weeks.
* Genotype 3: Test RAS if Y93H + add RBV.

## Decompensated cirrhosis:
* Contraindicated: Protease inhibitor, IFN.
* RBV eligible: Sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg) x 12 weeks.
* RBV ineligible: Sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg) x 24 weeks.

# AUTO IMMUNE HEPATITIS

## Pathophysiology & clinical presentation

### Pathophysiology:
* T cell mediated autoimmunity d/t molecular mimicry by foreign antigens.
* CD 4 helper cells: Principal cells, activate CD 8 cells, plasma cells and Th 17 lymphocytes.
* CD 8 cytotoxic cells: Effector cells.
* Hepatocyte loss: D/t apoptosis.
* Apoptotic bodies act as neoantigens → Formation of reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species.
* Activation of Kupffer cells → Stellate cells lead to fibrosis.
* Counter regulatory molecules damaged: miRNA, CD163, PD-1 (Programme death-1).
* Epitope spreading: Epitope recognised by antigen presenting cells spreads to other cells → Damage to normal cells.

## Genetic predisposition:
* HLA haplotype: A1-B 8-DR 3
* DRAI*0301: most specific, young patients, severe disease.
* DRB1*0401 and DRB1*0405: Elderly patients, milder disease.
* Variants of CD 152 molecule: Costimulatory molecule.
* CARD-10 single nucleotide polymorphism.

## Associated autoimmune diseases:
* Hashimoto's disease.
* Grave's disease.
* Rheumatoid arthritis.
* Vitiligo.
* Alopecia areata.
* Inflammatory bowel disease: Atypical P-ANCA positive.
* Celiac disease: 2-8% patients of autoimmune hepatitis.
* Diabetes mellitus type 1.
* Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

## Clinical Features:
* Bimodal presentation: Puberty, 4th-6th decade.
* Female preponderance (F: m is 3.5: 1).
* 1/3rd of adults and 1/2 of pediatric cases have cirrhosis at presentation.

### Presentation:
* Asymptomatic.
* Non specific symptoms: Fatigue, malaise, weight loss, arthralgia.
* Acute/fulminant hepatitis.
* m/c symptom: Fatigue (86%).
* m/c sign: Hepatomegaly.
* Association with other autoimmune diseases: 20-40% cases

## Diagnosis
### Liver function tests:
* AST (Aspartate transaminase), ALT (Alanine transaminase): 3-50 times the upper limit of normal.
* Alkaline phosphatase (ALP):
    * upto ax the upper normal limit (UNL).
    * > 4x ULN: Consider other causes.

## Total protein increased
Albumin decreased, globulin increased (IgG >>> Igm).

### Prognostic markers
* IgG levels.
* γ Glutamyl transferase (GGT) ↑: Predictor of steroid responsiveness.
* Ferritin ↑: Poor prognosis.
* Vitamin D ↓: Poor prognosis.

### USG abdomen:
Increased echogenicity of liver.

### Differential diagnosis:
* Wilson's disease.
* Non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): Dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus.
* Drug induced liver injury.

### Serology:
* ANA: Antinuclear antibody.
* Anti LKM: Anti liver kidney microsomal antibody. First line antibodies.
* SMA: Smooth muscle autoantibody.
* LC-1, P-ANCA, anti SLA, anti actin antibodies:
    * Second line antibodies.
    * Probable AIH if first line antibodies are absent.
* Antibody panel: Indirect immunofluorescence method.
    * ANA + SMA: Specificity 90%, sensitivity 40%.
    * Anti Lkm I antibody: In absence of ANA, anti SMA.

### Antinuclear antibody (ANA):
* Immunofluorescence testing: Fine speckled > homogenous pattern.
* Even low titre of 1: 40 in children is significant.
* Titre of 1: 40 in adults is not significant.
* Higher the titre, more the specificity.

### Subtypes of ANA:
* Anti dsDNA: Specific for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) + SLE (Systemic lupus erythematosus).
* Anti Ro antibody: If pregnant, increased risk of congenital heart blocks.

## Smooth muscle autoantibody (SMA):
* Against F-actin.
* Distinct staining patterns at areas of smooth muscles: Arteries.
* Slightly higher titres can be normal in adults.
* Higher the titre, more is the specificity.

## Anti liver kidney microsomal autoantibodies (Anti LKM):
* Against CYP2D6.
* LKM 1: Hepatitis C virus, autoimmune hepatitis.
* LKM 3: Hepatitis D virus, autoimmune hepatitis.
* Lkm 2: Drug induced liver injury.

## SLA:
* Target: SEPSECS.
* SEPSECS: Transfer ribonucleoprotein for selenocysteine.
* Associated with HLA DRB1*03: Young age, severe disease.
* Severe relapse on drug withdrawal.
* Estimation can be done with ELISA.
* Indirect immunofluorescence is not required.
* most specific antibody.

## Autoantibodies

| Autoantibodies | Antigen target | Features |
|---|---|---|
| ANA | multiple nuclear antigens |  |
| SMA | Actin F and G, Non actin components | Autoimmune hepatitis type I |
| Anti LKMI | CYP2D6 | Autoimmune hepatitis type II, Type I autoimmune hepatitis, most specific (99%), rare, A/w anti Ro/SSA: Congenital heart block, A/w severe disease/relapse, may be a sole marker of AIH |
| Anti SLA | SEPSECS |  |
| Atypical P-ANCA | β Tubulin isotype 5 | A/w ulcerative colitis, Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), minocycline induced liver injury, Result of gut derived reactivity |
| Anti actin | Actin F and G | If a/w anti actinin antibody: Severe disease |
| Anti LCI | Formiminotransferase | Associated with anti LKMI, Young patients, severe disease, very bad prognosis if drug withdrawal |

## Histopathology (Liver biopsy):
* Definitive diagnosis of AIH
* Chronicity/flares
* Degree of cirrhosis: 15-40% cases have cirrhosis.

### Characteristic features of AIH
1. Interface hepatitis.
2. Emperipolesis.
3. Rosetting of hepatocytes.

## Scoring systems:
* Comprehensive scoring system: used in clinical trials.
* Simplified scoring system (used clinically):
    * Autoantibody expression: Indirect immunofluorescence.
    * IgG concentration.
    * Histological features.
    * Viral markers.

## Treatment algorithm for AIH

![Treatment algorithm](image_3.png)

## Azathioprine:
Grade D drug.
Placenta: Acts as a partial barrier to azathioprine, can be continued in pregnancy.
S/E (Seen in mice students):
* Cleft palate.
* Skeletal anomalies.
* Hydrops fetalis.
* Reduced thymic size.
* ssbsukirat@gmail.com anemia and bone marrow suppression.
* Can cause hepatotoxicity.
Dose: 1-2 mg/kg, initially 50 mg/day.

## AASLD first line treatment regimen:
Combination regimen:
* Induction phase (4 weeks): Prednisolone 30 mg/day (Slowly tapered) + azathioprine 50 mg/day.
* maintenance phase: Prednisolone 10 mg/day + azathioprine 50 mg/day.

## Indications for treatment:
### Absolute:
* S. AST ≥ 10X ULN
* S. AST ≥ 5x ULN and IgG ≥ 2x ULN.
* Biopsy showing bridging/multiacinar necrosis.
* Incapacitating symptoms.

### Relative:
* Few symptoms.
* S. AST, IgG levels less than absolute criteria.
* Interface hepatitis on HPE.

## Autoimmune hepatitis scoring based on HPE findings:
### Grading based on:
a. Periportal/bridging necrosis.
b. Intralobular degeneration and focal necrosis.
c. Portal inflammation.

### Staging:
Based on fibrosis (Cirrhosis: Score 4).
Grading is reversible, staging may not be reversible.

## Second line treatment:
1. High dose glucocorticoids (30 mg/day) + Azathioprine (150 mg/day).
Continue the same dose till biochemical improvement.
Later, dose is tapered down.
Azathioprine mediated hepatotoxicity: Only AST/ALT levels increase, IgG levels remain same.
2. mycophenolate mofetil:
Purine antagonist, teratogenic.
C/I in pregnancy.
S/e: Severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain.
3. 6-mp:
In Azathioprine intolerance.
Not used in case of azathioprine related liver injury/pancreatitis.
4. Calcineurin inhibitors: Tacrolimus.
5. Cyclosporine.
6. Anti TNF mab: Infliximab.
7. Rituximab (Less role).

## Follow up the patients with remission:
* Taper steroids, adapt Azathioprine dose as required to retain remission.
* Lifelong monitoring: 3 monthly for 1 year, then 6 monthly.

## AIH and pregnancy:
* Pregnancy is an immunotolerant state.
* Disease activity is usually milder during pregnancy.
* During pregnancy, continue azathioprine, tapered down prednisolone (20 mg/day) and withdrawn.
* Anti Ro/SSA antibodies: Risk of congenital heart block.
* After delivery, flares can occur (D/t immune reconstitution).
* After pregnancy, steroid dose can be increased

## Liver transplantation:
### Indications:
* No response to I/v steroids.
* Acute liver failure.
* MELD > 16.
* 5 year survival rate: 73-79%.
* Recurrence: 10% at 1 year and 50% in 5 years.

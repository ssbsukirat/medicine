# PORTAL HYPERTENSION

## Normal portal circulation

### Portal vein:

#### Formation:
* Foregut: Splenic vein.
* midgut: SMV.
* Hind Gut: IMV (Joins splenic vein).
* Formation of portal vein: SMV + Splenic vein.

#### Tributaries:
* Left gastric vein (Coronary vein): Left sided.
* Short gastric and posterior gastric vein (Drain into splenic vein).
* Left umbilical vein (Fibrosed, open in portal HTN): Left sided.
* Cystic vein: Right sided.

#### Anatomy:
* Branches: Right and left Pv.
* 7.5 to 8 cm width.
* Portal vein → Divides into sinusoids → Terminal vein → Central vein → Hepatic veins (3) → IVC.
* Caudate lobe drains into IVC seperately.

## Salient features of portal venous system:

* High compliance, low resistance system.
* Dual blood supply: 70 % of blood carried by PV, 30 % by hepatic artery, both contribute 30 % of CO.
* Hepatic arterial buffer response: Compensatory mechanism to maintain perfusion of the liver by hepatic arterial vasodilation on reduction of portal venous perfusion.
* Circadian variation in blood flow present (Night: High flow).
* Sinusoids: Fenestrated, diffusion of macromolecules into space of disse.
* Hepatic stellate cells (Principle cells):
    * a. Present in space of Disse and stores vit A.
    * b. Portal HTN → Activation → Releases pro-inflammatory and procollagenous cytokines → Collagen deposition in space of disse and hepatocytes.
* Kupffer cells: macrophages present within sinusoids.
* myofibroblasts:
    * a. Contract and relax.
    * b. Activation of stellate cells → Epithelial mesenchymal transactivation → malignant transformation.

## Vascular Disorders & Portal Hypertension

### Vasoactive mediators:

* NO: Produced with shear stress → Sensed by sinusoidal endothelial cells → Produce eNOS (Not activated in chronic liver disease).
* ET I produced by endothelial cells,
* ET AR (Constriction) and ET BR(vasodilation).
* Carbon monoxide.
* Norepinephrine.
* Angiotensin.
* Prostaglandins.
* Thromboxane.
* Leukotrienes
* Hydrogen sulfide.

**In CLD:**

| Liver circulation | Splanchnic circulation |
|---|---|
| ↓ NO. | ↑ NO. |
| ↑ ET I (ET α). | ↓ ET I (ET b). |
| Vasoconstriction. | Vasodilation. |

### Portal hypertension

#### Portal venous pressure:
Normal: 5 to 10 mm Hg.

#### Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG):
* used in measurement of Portal venous pressure.
* Normal: ≤ 5 mmHg.
* mild portal HTN: 6 to 10 mmHg.
* Clinically significant portal HTN: > 10 mmHg.
* Variceal bleed: > 12 mmHg.

$$Portal \ HTN = intrahepatic \ resistance \ and \ flow$$

$$5b77f64d55f0f498b2abar1 \ P = Q \times R$$

$$Poiseuille's \ law: \ R = \frac{8nL}{\pi r^4}, \ radius \ is \ the \ most \ important \ factor.$$

#### Intrahepatic resistance:
major driver of portal hypertension.
* Static (Structural resistance): Fibrotic regenerative nodules and fibrotic bands.
* Dynamic (Non structural resistance):
    * Lack Of NO→ Activate HSCs to constrict the sinusoids.
    * High ET I→ HSCS and endothelial cells → more ET I released
    * α1 adrenergic receptor blockade.

## Vasodilators and vasoconstrictors:

**Vasodilators**
* Adenosine
* Carbon monoxide
* Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor
* Hydrogen sulfide
* Nitric oxide
* Prostacyclin
* Serotonin

**Vasoconstrictors**
* Angiotensin
* Endothelin-1
* Leukotrienes
* Norepinephrine
* Serotonin
* Thromboxane

### Hyperdynamic circulation:
Splanchnic vasodilatation due to:
* NO.
* Excessive eNOS expression – ET I /VEGF /TNF α.
* Anandamide.
* Heme oxygenase.
* Lipopolysaccharide.

### Collateral circulation:
Connects portal to systemic circulation.
Develops and expands in response to increased portal pressure.
Reversal of normal flow occurs: Hepatofugal flow.
Formed by: NO and VEGF.

**Sites:**
* Distal esophagus and proximal stomach.
* Umbilicus.
* Retroperitoneum.
* Rectum.

### Zone of esophageal varices:
* Gastric zone. Decompression of pressure occurs due to presence of perforating vessles.
* Perforating zone.
* Truncal zone.
* Palisade zone: Absence of perforating vessels → varices formation (Bleeder zone).
* Hallmark of portal HTN: increased flow in azygous vein.
* Coronary veins → Carry blood from left part of portal vein → Lower esophagus /cardia.
* Intrahepatic resistance → ↑ flow by coronary veins → Esophageal varices/ gastro-esophageal varices.

---

## Surgical Management

### Short gastric veins
Fundus of the stomach → Splenic vein.
Splenic vein thrombus → IGV, splenorenal shunt can spontaneously develop.
Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) > 6 mm Hg: Portal HTN; >10 mm Hg clinically significant Portal HTN (CSPH).

### Variceal rupture/bleed (HVPG >12 mm Hg):
$$Laplace \ law \rightarrow T = Pr/w$$
* T: Tension.
* P: Pressure gradient b/t varices and esophageal lumen.
* r: Radius of varices.
* w: Thickness.

### Measurements

**Factors measured:**
1. Hepatic vein pressure gradient.
2. Splenic pulp pressure.
3. Portal vein pressure.
4. Endoscopic variceal pressure.

**Hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG):**

|---|---|---|---|
| Prehepatic | Normal | Normal | Normal |
| Presinusoidal | Normal | Normal | Normal |
| Sinusoidal | Increased | Normal | Increased |
| Postsinusoidal | Increased | Normal | Increased |

* Presinusoidal portal hypertension diagnosed.
* Risk of bleeding present.

### Portal vein pressure:
* Percutaneous transhepatic route.
* Transvenous approach.

## Primary & Secondary Prophylaxis

Note: Alcohol is the etiological agent for all three intrahepatic causes.

Common causes:
* Cirrhosis: Alcohol, hereditary hemochromatosis, primary biliary cirhosis and autoimmune hepatitis.
* Schistosomiasis.
* Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis: Umbilical vein thrombosis, better lifespan, later with parenchymal extinction → Becomes cirrhotic.
* Idiopathic portal hypertension: Banti's syndrome, NCPF (Non cirrhotic portal HTN).
* Cardiac fibrosis.
* Fontan associated liver disease: Associated in children undergoing fontan procedure.

Less common causes:
* Nodular regenerative hyperplasia: Hypertrophy of zone 1 and atrophy of zone 3.
* Partial nodular transformation of the liver.
* Fibropolycystic liver disease: Caroli's disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis.
* Sarcoidosis.
* malignancy: Hepatocellular carcinoma.
* Splanchnic arteriovenous fistula: venous bruit in the left upper quadrant.
* Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).

## Management

### Medical Management

**Vasopressin analogs:**
Splanchnic vasoconstriction → Reduces portal venous inflow→↓ Portal pressure.
S/E:
* Bowel necrosis.
* MI: -ve ionotropic and -ve chronotropic action on heart → ↑ after load
* Hyponatremia.
Terlipressin used now: Less adverse reaction and half life (4 hours).

**Somatostatin and its analogs:**
* Inhibits glucagon release→↓ portal blood flow.
* Direct action on ET I→↓ Production.
* Receptors: SRTR I to SRTR 5

## Beta Blockers & Endoscopic Therapy

β adrenergic blocking agents:
MOA:
* β1 blockage: ↓CO.
* β3 Blockage: Causes unopposed α1 action.
* Portal pressure: Decreased
* Responders: IV propranolol → HVPG checked after 20 mins→↓ by 10 % or < 12 mmHg.

Drugs:
* Nadolol: Better, less lipid soluble, excreted by kidney.
* Propranolol: used in India, causes night terrors and depression.

Combined α and β adrenergic blocking agents:
Carvedilol: Non selectibe β blocker + weak α1 block.
α1 block: ↓ intrahepatic resistance, antioxidant and antiproliferative action.

Dose ↑ gradually till tolerated:
* SBP : > 90 mmHg.
* HR: 55 to 60 bpm or < 25 % of baseline.

**Endoscopic therapy:**
Causes:
* Prevention of bleed.
* Control of bleed
* Prevention of rebleed.

Types:
1. Sclerotherapy.
2. Endoscopic band ligation (EBL).
3. Endoscopic USG (EUS).
4. Hemostatic sprays.

**Endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVL):**
Preferred method.
method: Endoscope is loaded with a multiband ligator → Reintubated into esophagus → Suction at the varix → Band placed around it → Thrombosis via strangulation of varix

## Complications & Balloon Tamponade

**Sclerotherapy:**
Sclerosants: Sodium tetradecyl sulfate (m/c), sodium morrhuate, ethanolamine and absolute alcohol
Site of injection: Intra and paravariceal.
Complications: ulcer, strictures and perforation.
Completely replaced with EVL.

**Complications of endoscopic variceal therapy:**

| Timing of complication | Complication |
|---|---|
| During procedure | Aspiration pneumonia |
| | Retrosternal chest pain |
| | Bleeding |
| | Esophageal dysmotility |
| | Esophageal stricture |
| | Esophageal ulcers |
| | Mediastinitis |
| | Perforation |
| Systemic (usually with Sclerotherapy) | Mesenteric venous thrombosis |

**Balloon tamponade:**
Control of bleeding upto 24 Hrs.
Types:
* Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (3 port).
* Minnesota tube (4 port).

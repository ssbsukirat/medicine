# PHYSIOLOGY AND LFT

## Bilirubin

### Bilirubin synthesis:
*   Source of heme: RBCs, cytochromes, myoglobin.
*   Total production: 4 mg/kg/day.
*   80% derived from hemoglobin degradation.
*   Sites of bilirubin production:
    *   Reticuloendothelial system (Spleen).
    *   Hepatocytes.
*   MRP2: ATP dependent, rate limiting step.
*   Bile:
    *   Only direct/conjugated bilirubin.
    *   80% diglucuronide.
*   Only direct bilirubin is excreted in urine.
*   Bilirubinuria: Only direct bilirubin.
*   Urobilinogen in urine in small amounts: Normal.

## Delta bilirubin:
*   Conjugated bilirubin covalently bonded to albumin → Cannot pass through glomerular membrane.
*   Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia but no bilirubinuria.
*   In multi organ dysfunction:
    *   D/t lack of ATP, MRP2 does not function, direct bilirubin is pushed via MRP3 into bloodstream.
*   Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia without obstruction.

## Measurement of bilirubin:

### Van den bergh reaction:
*   Diazo reaction.
*   Blood + diazotized sulfanilic acid (30-60 sec) → Colour change = Direct bilirubin.
*   Add accelerator (Alcohol/caffeine) → (After 1 hour) = Total bilirubin.
*   Total bilirubin – indirect bilirubin = indirect bilirubin.

High performance liquid chromatography: Commonly used.

$$T_{1/2}$$ of bilirubin: 4 hours.
$$T_{1/2}$$ of delta bilirubin: 14-21 days.

## Hyperbilirubinemia

### Isolated hyperbilirubinemia:
*   Increased production: Hemolysis.
*   Decreased uptake: OATP1B1/B3.
*   Decreased conjugation.
*   Decreased excretion.

### Conjugation defects:
D/t deficiency of UDP glucuronyl transferase enzyme: UGT1A1 gene, chr 2.

### Types:
*   Crigler Najjar syndrome type I.
*   Crigler Najjar syndrome type II.
*   Gilbert syndrome (m/c).
*   Crigler Najjar syndrome type II:
    *   Complete enzyme deficiency.
    *   Complete absence of UGT1A1: Exons 2, 3, 4, 5.
    *   Autosomal recessive.
    *   All races are affected.

## Basics of Hepatology

### C/F:
*   Not compatible with life.
*   Severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of hemolysis.
*   Presents in the first few days of life.
*   Kernicterus.
*   All races are affected.

### Investigations:
*   Bilirubin levels: 18 mg/dL to 30 mg/dL (indirect bilirubin).
*   Biopsy: Bile plugs in canaliculi and bile ducts.

### Treatment:
*   Phototherapy:
    *   Converts into bilirubin isomers (water soluble), excreted in bile.
    *   Temporary change only.
    *   Calcium supplements increase the effectiveness of phototherapy.
*   Plasmapheresis.
*   Orthotopic liver transplantation: Treatment of choice.
*   Crigler Najjar syndrome type II:
    *   Some deficiency of UDP glucuronyl transferase enzyme.
    *   Exons of UGT1A1: Single amino acid substitution >> deletions.

### Presentation:
*   Late, before 10 year of age.
*   Kernicterus is uncommon.

### Serum bilirubin:
*   Baseline bilirubin levels: 10 mg/dL (8-18 mg/dL).
*   During periods of stress: Levels increase.
*   <50% of normal bilirubin in bile.
*   Proportion of monoglucuronides: Increases (30%).
*   Treatment: Phenobarbital (enzyme inducer).

### Gilbert syndrome:
*   10-12% of normal population.
*   Incidental diagnosis.
*   Presents in adulthood.
*   Bilirubin levels:
    *   ↑ unconjugated bilirubin: <3mg/dL.
    *   Fluctuations: ↑ during infections, fasting, alcohol consumption (<7 mg/dL).

## UGT1A1 mutation:
*   UDP glucuronyl transferase levels reduced to 30%.
*   mutation in promotor region: TATAA element.

### Clinical implications:
*   Prolonged neonatal jaundice.
*   Irinotecan: Anticancer agent, also metabolised by UGT1A1, → Severe refractory diarrhea in patients with Gilbert syndrome.
*   ↓ risk of cardiac diseases: D/t antioxidant effect of indirect hyperbilirubinemia.

## Isolated conjugated/mixed hyperbilirubinemias:

### Dubin Johnson syndrome:
*   mutations of ABCC2 gene: MRP2 transporter defect.
*   upregulation of MRP3 → Conjugated bilirubin goes into plasma.
*   Autosomal recessive.

### C/F:
*   Non hemolytic jaundice.
*   mild icterus.
*   usually diagnosed at puberty.

### Bilirubin levels:
*   Direct bilirubin ↑.
*   Can go upto 20-40 mg/dL during intercurrent illness, pregnancy, oral contraceptives intake.
*   urine coproporphyrin I > III (Normal: Coproporphyrin III > I).

### Biopsy:
Black liver d/t deposition of melanin related pigment and epinephrine metabolites in lysosomes.

### Rotor syndrome:
*   Similar to Dubin Johnson syndrome.
*   Autosomal recessive.
*   Defective reuptake of bilirubin via OATP1B1, OATP1B3.
*   SLCO1B1, SLCO1B3: Gene mutations.
*   Increased urine coproporphyrin (> I).
*   Biopsy: No liver pigmentation.
*   ↑ risk of methotrexate and statin toxicity.

## Quantitative liver function tests

### Indocyanine green clearance:
*   Indocyanine green dye: 97% biliary excretion of an injected dose.
*   measures hepatic blood flow.
*   marker of hepatic dysfunction.
*   Cirrhotic liver does not take up indocyanine green dye.

### galactose elimination capacity:
*   measure of functional hepatic mass.
*   Give bolus dose and do serial blood sampling.
*   Chronic liver disease: decreased clearance.

### Caffeine clearance:
*   measures functional hepatic capacity.
*   Assesses CYP 450, xanthine oxidase, NAT enzymes.
*   Oral dose given and serial monitoring done: blood, urine, saliva, breath, hair can be used.

### Lignocaine metabolite formation:
*   Lignocaine is metabolised into monoethylglycinexylide (MEGX) via CYP450 cytochromes.
*   Lignocaine is injected and MEGX levels are measured at 15, 30, 60 minutes.

### Aminopyrine breath test:
*   measures mixed function oxidase level.
*   Oral dose of radiolabelled aminopyrine f/b breath analysis.

### Non-classical liver function tests

### Bile acids:
*   Has multiple transporters in the liver.
*   Tight recirculation.
*   High hepatic flow.
*   Not a sensitive test.
*   Has no correlation with HFE.
*   Has role in cholestasis of pregnancy: Bile acid levels are increased.

### Prothrombin time/INR:
*   Assesses extrinsic pathway of coagulation: Factor II, V, VII.
*   All clotting factors are synthesised by liver except factor VIII from endothelial cells.

### Half life of factor VII: 6 hours.
*   Sensitive, marker of acute fulminant liver failure.
*   INR is increased in:
    *   Acute fulminant liver failure.
    *   DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation).
    *   Vitamin K deficiency.
*   It is not a measure of bleeding in liver disease:
    *   Because liver secretes both procoagulant and anticoagulant factors (Protein C, S, antithrombin III).
    *   In acute liver failure with high INR there is more risk of thrombosis than bleeding.
    *   In chronic liver disease the chances of bleeding and thrombosis is equal.

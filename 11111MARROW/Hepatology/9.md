# VIRAL HEPATITIS

Also known as acute viral hepatitis.
MCC of hepatitis in India.

## Hepatitis A

### Features:
*   Most common cause of viral hepatitis.
*   Only 1 known serotype.
*   Picornaviridae family: Enterovirus.
*   Icosahedral shape: 28 nm in diameter.
*   Non-enveloped, single stranded RNA.
*   Mode of transmission: Fecal-oral route.
*   Survives in acidic environments.
*   Withstands gastric acid.
*   Killed at 85°C for 1 minute.
*   Entry to cell receptor: unknown.
*   Require calcium for entry.
*   Inhibited by trypsin, phospholipases and β-galactosidase.
*   Enters cell → RNA is uncoated → Ribosomes bind to viral RNA → Form polysomes → Polyprotein 2227 AA.
*   Polyprotein has 3 parts:
    *   P1: Structural genes.
    *   P2 and P3: Non-structural genes.
*   P1 further divided into VP1, VP3, VP3, and VP4 which codes for structural proteins.
*   Human HAV: 4 genotypes (I, II, III, and VII).
*   Only 0.01% of HAV patients develop acute liver failure.
*   Severity depends on: Variations in the HAV genome at 5' untranslated region.

### Epidemiologic patterns:
*   Differs from developed, developing to closed communities.
*   In developing countries, due to poor sanitary conditions, infection seen at an early age in pre school children.

## Infectious Hepatitis

### Anicteric hepatitis seen.
*   Constant infection present in the population.
*   In industrialized countries, infection is low among children and young adults.
*   Icteric hepatitis seen.
*   In closed or semiclosed communities, cycles of infection seen.
*   Mode of transmission:
    *   Fecal-oral
    *   Parenteral route.
*   Clinical sequelae is severe in older age group.
*   No chronicity.
*   Acute, self-limiting.
*   Rarely, prolonged or a relapsing course and cholestasis may be seen.

### Clinical presentation:
*   IP: 2-4 weeks up to 6 weeks.

### C/F:
*   Fever, malaise and jaundice.

1.  **Asymptomatic**: Anicteric hepatitis.
2.  **Symptomatic**:
    *   Self-limited.
    *   Lasts for 8 weeks.
3.  **Cholestatic hepatitis**:
    *   Rare.
    *   Lasts for 73-6 months.
    *   Virus is cleared from body and is a immunological response.
    *   Treatment: Corticosteroids can be given if virus has shed off.
4.  **Relapsing**:
    *   10% to 15% cases develop recurrent jaundice after full recovery within 6 months of index episode.
5.  **Acute liver failure (ALF)**:
    *   Very rare.
    *   Case fatality rate: 0.02/100,000.
    *   Risk of development of ALF highest within 1 week and then within 4 weeks.
    *   After 1 month no incidence of liver failure.
    *   Age >75 and s. creatinine >2 at presentation, liver transplantation maybe needed.

## HAV and pregnancy:
*   No increase in mortality.
*   Gestational complications present:
    *   Premature contractions.
    *   PROM.
    *   Placental separation.
    *   Vaginal bleeding.

## Extrahepatic manifestations:
*   Evanescent rash.
*   Arthralgias > Arthritis (Lower limb).
*   Leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
*   Glomerulonephritis.
*   Arthritis (IC).
*   Cryoglobulinemia.
*   Trigger the onset of autoimmune hepatitis type 1.

## Diagnosis:
*   Skin biopsy:
    *   Igm anti-HAV and complement in vessel wall.
    *   From the onset to 4 months.
    *   Igm anti-HAV in serum.
    *   RNA: For research settings. Present upto 1 month.

## Treatment:
*   Symptomatic treatment.
*   Attention to sanitation.
*   Immunoglobulins.
*   Vaccines.
    *   Highly endemic countries: No need for large scale.
    *   Intermediate: Vaccination on a large scale.
    *   Low or very low endemicity: Targeted vaccination.

## Groups at high risk of HAV infection:
*   Healthy persons who:
    *   Travel to endemic areas.
    *   Have infected family members.
    *   Adopt infants or children from an endemic area.
    *   Men who have sex with men.
    *   Persons who have tested positive for HIV.
    *   Persons with chronic liver disease.
    *   Persons with a clotting factor disorder.
    *   People who inject drugs or users of noninjection illicit drugs.

## Vaccine:
*   Formalin inactivated HAV vaccine:
    *   Grown in cell culture.
    *   Adjuvant: Alum.
*   2 types:
    *   HAVRIX: Strain is HM175.
    *   VAQTA: Strain is CR326.
*   Duration of documented immunity: 40 years.
*   Approved for people >1 year.
*   At least a weeks before travel: Single dose either vaccine or Ig.
*   TWINRIX:
    *   Contains HAV & HBV strains.
    *   Given to individuals >18 years.
    *   Given to inmates at correctional facilities.

*   Viremia: 2 weeks after onset.
*   Fecal shedding: 4 weeks after onset.
*   AST and ALT is high.
*   Non cytopathic.
*   Cholestasis can occur.
*   Gland-like transformation of parenchymal cells.
*   Severe liver damage during pregnancy.
*   Genotypes 3 and 4 has milder disease.
*   Genotype 1 or a during pregnancy causes severe disease.

# HEMOCHROMATOSIS

## Introduction

### Iron metabolism:
* Iron is responsible for the formation of haemoglobin which carries oxygen to all parts of the body.
* It is not tightly regulated.
* Iron requirement primarily depends on requirements for hematopoiesis.
* Iron in blood is derived from a sources: Intestinal absorption and extravascular hemolysis (Hemolysis of senescent RBCs).
* Iron stores in the body: 49g.
* RDA: 1 to 1.5 mg/day.

### Iron absorption:
* Two forms: Heme and non-heme iron ($Fe^{2+}$).
* Site of absorption: Duodenum
* Required pH: Acidic.
* Enterocyte: Absorbs ionic/non-heme iron.
* DMT1: Absorbs ferrous iron.
* Ferroportin: Sole iron exporter in mammals (Transports iron into the blood).
* Ferrioxidase/hephaestin: Converts $Fe^{2+}$ to $Fe^{3+}$ in the plasma.
* Enterocyte iron's a outcomes: Lost by shedding of epithelial cells/gets into the plasma.

## Hepcidin:

* It is a defensin like anti-microbial peptide.
* AKA: Hemochromatosis hormone, LEAP-I.
* Gene: *HAMP*.
* Function:
    * Degrades ferroportin (*SLC40A1* gene) & blocks the release of iron from enterocytes.
    * Inhibits the release of iron from macrophages.
    * Antibacterial and antifungal.

### Regulators:
* Inflammation (IL-6, 1, 22) → ↑ Hepcidin → Anemia of chronic disease.
* Inflammation and stress → ↑ Hepcidin via CRESH pathway.
* Iron induced regulation via BMP 6 & SMAD pathway.
* Hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ALD/HCV) → ↓ Hepcidin.
* EPO (BMP, TGF-B).

## The iron sensing machinery:

* Two types: Transferrin and BMP6
* Transferrin → Senses iron stores.
* BMP6:
    * BMP6 is from hepatic sinusoidal cells and non parenchymal hepatocytes.
    * BMP → BMP receptors, co receptors & ancillary proteins → SMAD related phosphorylation → Hepcidin transcription → Takes up ferroportin → Regulation of iron.
* BMP receptor: Not Known.
* Co receptor: Hemojuvelin & HJV.
* Ancillary proteins: HFE & TFR2.

## HFE protein:

* Gene: HLA region on the short arm of chromosome 6.
* Encodes: 343 amino acid protein.
* Structure: Large extracellular domain, single transmembrane domain & a short cytoplasmic tail
* The extracellular domain: Has 3 loops (α1, α2 α3).
* Intramolecular disulphide bonds: Between α1 and α3.

## Associated with: α1-microglobulin.

* Substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at amino acid position 282 in the α3 chain (C282Y): HFE loses the disulphide bond.
* Change of a histidine to an aspartate at amino acid position 63 in the α1 chain (H63D).
* Homozygous for C282Y/C282Y.
* Compound heterozygotes for C282Y/H63D.

## Iron overload

### Two types:
* Primary (Hereditary).
* Secondary (Acquired).

### Primary iron over load:
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH):
* Type 1: HFE related HH:
    * C282Y/C282Y homozygosity.
    * C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity.
* Type 2: Non-HFE related HH:
    * Type 2A: Hemojuvelin (HJV) mutations.
    * Type 2B: Hepcidin (HAMP) mutations.
* Type 3: Transferrin receptor a (TFR2) mutations.
* Type 4: Ferroportin (*SLC40A1*) mutations.
* Type 1, 2 and 3 are autosomal recessive while type 4 is autosomal dominant.

### Secondary iron over load:
Due to ineffective hemopoiesis which includes:
* Thalassemia.
* Sideroblastic anaemia.
* Hemolytic anaemia.

## Clinical features

### Features of HFE related HH:
* Inheritance: Autosomal recessive.
* Mutation: Equal between genders but penetrance is much lesser in women.
* Symptoms: Weakness & lethargy (most common), arthralgias, abdominal pain and loss of libido in men.

| System | Features |
|---|---|
| GI (Liver) | Gross: Hepatomegaly (CLD will be present & PHTN features will be less). Histology: micronodular cirrhosis. AST/ALT: mild elevation. Cause of death: HCC (Presents after cirrhosis). Reversible: If there is no cirrhosis (Cirrhosis can lead to diabetes). Diabetes (mc). |
| Endocrine | Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Primary testicular failure is present). Hypothyroidism. Adrenal function is normal. |
| CVS | Cardiomyopathy. Atrial & ventricular dysrhythmias. Heart failure. Seen in Type 2 HH (Juvenile hemochromatosis). |
| MSK (Joints) | MCP and 3rd. Joint space narrowing, chondrocalcinosis, subchondral cyst formation & osteopenia. Joint symptoms does not decrease with phlebotomy. |
| MSK (Skin) | Bronze discoloration d/t melanin. Grey pigmentation d/t iron in the basal layers. Arthritis and hypogonadism does not improve. |
| Infections | Common in iron loaded states. Vibrio vulnificus. Listeria monocytogenes. Yersinia enterocolitica. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. |

## Juvenile HH:

* Severe iron overload.
* manifests in childhood.
* HJV & HAMP mutation.
* HJV mutation more common (Chromosome 1q).
* Heart & endocrine manifestations.

## Type 4 ferroportin mutation:

| Classical ferroportin disease | Non classical ferroportin disease |
|---|---|
| Loss of function mutation. Ferroportin downregulation. Iron loading in macrophages. No iron loading in parenchymal cells. Not pathogenic. | Gain of function mutation. No ferroportin downregulation. No iron loading in macrophages. Iron loading in parenchymal cells. Pathogenic. |

* Iron deposition in Kupffer cells:
    * Classical ferroportin disease.
    * African HH (Bantu disease).
* Genetic susceptibility & excessive dietary iron intake (Iron pots).
* Transfusion related

## Diagnosis

### Investigations:
* Transferrin saturation = Iron + TIBC × 100% (most sensitive and specific test).
* Ferritin levels (Increased ferritin level + normal TS value: Inflammatory disorder).
* Biopsy:
    * Site: Liver biopsy.
    * Stain: Peri's prussian blue.

### Peri's stain grading:
* Grade 1 to 2: Normal livers.
* Grade 3: ALD, CLD and HCV.
* Grade 4: HFE-HH

## Findings:

* HFE: Hepatocytes & no kupffer cell involvement.
* Ferroportin disease: Kupffer cell involvement.

## Hepatic iron concentration and HH:

* Normal HIC: <1500 mcg/g.
* Symptomatic pts: >10000 mcg/g.
* Fibrosis and cirrhosis: >20000 mcg/g.
* Hepatic iron index (HII): micromoles of iron per gram dry weight of liver/ patient's age.
* HII greater than 1.9 = HH.

## Treatment

### Phlebotomy:
* Normal life span if treatment is begun early.
* 1 unit blood contains 200-250 mg iron.
* Weekly phlebotomy is done till HCT becomes <37%.
* TS & ferritin levels done are to be done 3 monthly.
* maintenance: 1 unit a monthly.
* Aim: TS <50% & Ferritin levels <100 ng/ml.

### Chelation:
* used in patients who can't do phlebotomy or with a coexisting disorder.
* Deferoxamine (s/c infusion).
* Deferasirox and deferiprone (Oral).

### HCC:
* Present only in cirrhosis.
* Cirrhosis not reversible due to phlebotomy but improvement is possible.

### Screening:
* HFE genotype & phenotype (Serum ferritin & TS) for 1st degree relatives.
* Liver biopsy if ferritin is >1000ng/ml + mutation.
* measure ferritin yearly for C282Y homozygotes/compound heterozygotes.
* Phlebotomy if ferritin is elevated.

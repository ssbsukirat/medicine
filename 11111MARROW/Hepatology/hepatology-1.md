# EMBRYOLOGY OF LIVER AND BILIARY TRACT


## Development of liver
Development begins at 3-4 weeks of gestation.

**Hepatic diverticulum**
*   Ventral diverticulum
*   Dorsal diverticulum

Cranial → Caudal
Liver: Superior part: Inferior duct:
Cystic duct & Ventral
CBD Pancreas

**Endodermal bud has bipotential hepatoblasts forms:**
*   Hepatocytes.
*   Cholangiocytes.

**Septum transversum forms:**
*   Connective tissue.
*   Stellate cells.
*   Capsule.

Yolk sac having resident macrophages forms: Kupffer cells.
Vitelline and umbilical veins: Forms sinusoids.

## Growth signalling:
Signals from:
*   Cardiogenic mesoderm : Fibroblast growth factors. (FGF) 1, 2, 8.
*   Septum transversum : Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP).

FGF & BMP activates transcription factors Prox-1 & Hhex (Biliary development).
Loss of E-Cadherin → Cells delaminate from the bud and invade.

**Hepatoblasts:**
They are bipotentiate cells.
Early markers: AFP & SOX-9.
Can differentiate into hepatocytes & cholangiocytes.

## Basics of Hepatology

**Hepatocytes:**
*   Formed by hepatoblasts having early markers AFP.
*   Contain HNF-4α.
*   Gives characteristic sinusoidal appearance.
*   They contain: Albumin, CK-8, CK-18

**Cholangiocytes:**
*   Formed by hepatoblasts having early markers SOX-9.
*   It is the marker for biliary development.
*   marker is lost as they invade septum transversum but reappars again.
*   They contain: CK-8, CK-18, CK-19.

## Vascular development
Development of venous system:
Starts at 4th gestational week.
*   Vitelline veins: Drains blood from yolk sac to heart. Goes through primitive liver
*   Umbilical veins: Drains blood from placenta to the heart.
*   Both Cardinal veins: Drain blood from everywhere else to heart.
*   Sinus venosus: Future heart
Only left umbilical vein & major part of right vitelline vein persists.

## Intra-viteline anastomoses
Total 4 in number (Subhepatic 3, subdiaphragmatic D.

**Subhepatic**
*   Inferior ventral.
*   Superior ventral.
*   middle: Dorsal

Sub diaphragmatic: Just below sinus venosus.
vessels grow along with liver → Future sinusoids.

**Umbilical circulation:**
Each side has 2 branches:
1.  Branch to liver.
2.  Branch to sinus venosus.
Right uv → Becomes completely fibrosed
Left uv → Forms ductus venosus.

**Development of arterial system:**
more straight forward.
Hepatic artery → Formed from celiac trunk.
Sometimes, hepatic artery forms from:
*   Superior mesenteric artery.
*   Left gastric artery.

## Intrahepatic duct (IBHD) development
Development starts from 6th week.
Develops from hilum → To the periphery of the liver (Following the portal vein).
At birth, intrahepatic biliary epithelium is still immature.
maturation is completed during first year of life.

**Stages of development:**
Begins with hepatocytes near PV.
Normal adult liver parenchymal cells have : CK 8 and 18.
Intrahepatic bile ducts have: CK 8,18 along with CK 7 and 19.
*   Hepatoblasts near the largest portal vein → Develop CK 8, 18, 19 by 8th week.
*   They form a new layer of cells by acquiring CK 7 & CK 19.
*   Inner layer surrounds the portal vein branches like a sleeve. (Called ductal plate).
This is called transient asymmetry (Occurs at 8th week).
Cells closest to the portal mesenchyme maintaining a biliary phenotype.
Cells closest to the parenchyma resemble hepatoblasts.

---

## Formation of double layer:
1.  Portal layer: Layer close to portal vein.
2.  Lobular layer: Layer close to parenchyma.
3.  Slit-like lumen forms in between.

If not involved in formation of bile duct → Ductal plate regresses by apoptosis.

**Cause of development:**
Mesenchyme secretes:
*   TGF-β
*   Jagged 1: Induces Notch 2 based signalling (Defective in Alagille syndrome).
TGF-B + NOTCH-2 → Stimulates differentiation of BD type cells.

**Extrahepatic duct (EBHD) development**
CBD, gall bladder, cystic duct: From caudal bud
Occurs by:
*   Progenitor cells expressing Pdx-1.
*   TX factor: SOX-17.
Primitive EHBD continues with IHBD and becomes whole.
Occurs before IHBD.

## Summary:
*   Liver development : 4 weeks.
*   Biliary development : 8 weeks.
*   Pouch (Hepatic diverticulum) : Develops from foregut.
*   FGF and BMP from outside the liver.
*   Prox-1 and Hhex from inside the liver.
*   Hepatoblasts to hepatocytes → HNF 4 alpha (Sinusoidal appearance).
*   AFP : marker of hepatoblasts and not of any other cells.
*   Earliest specific marker of Biliary development : SOX-19.
*   Hepatocytes : CK-8 and 18.
*   Cholangiocytes : CK8, 18, 19 and CK 7 (Last formed is CK).
*   IHBD : TGF β and Jagged-1 (NOTCH-2 signalling).
*   EHBD : Pdx-1 and SOX-17.
*   Ligamentum teres : Remnant of umbilical vein outside the liver.
*   Ligamentum venosum: Remnant of ductal venosus formed from left umbilical vein.

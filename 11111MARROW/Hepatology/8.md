# LIVER TUMORS

## Hepatocellular carcinoma
most common 1° malignant tumor in adults (75-85%).
6th m/c cancer in the world, 3rd in cancer mortality.
males > Females (3.7:1).

## Etiology
*   Cirrhosis: 2% annual chances.
*   HBV:
    *   Hbxag has activating genes.
    *   Earlier the chances of HBV infection, higher chances of HCC.
    *   HCC without cirrhosis.
*   HCV.
*   NAFLD: 1/5th can cause HCC without cirrhosis.

## Risk factors
### major
*   Chronic HBV infection.
*   Chronic HCV infection.
*   Cirrhosis.
*   NAFLD.

### Other liver conditions
*   α 1 antitrypsin deficiency.
*   Hemochromatosis: If untreated, 45% can progress to HCC.
*   Membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava.
*   Type I and type α glycogen storage disease: HCC without cirrhosis.
*   Type I hereditary tyrosinemia.
*   Wilson disease.

## Inherited conditions
*   Ataxia telangiectasia.
*   Hypercitrullinemia.

## Other factors
*   Cigarette smoking.
*   Diabetes mellitus.
*   Dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1.
*   Oral contraceptive steroid use.

## Symptom
*   Abdominal pain (59-95%).
*   Weight loss (34-71%).
*   Weakness (22-53%).
*   Abdominal swelling (28-43%).
*   Nonspecific GI symptoms (25-28%).
*   Jaundice (5-26%).

## Sign
*   Hepatomegaly (54-98%).
*   Ascites (35-61%).
*   Fever (11-54%).
*   Splenomegaly (27-42%).
*   Wasting (25-41%).
*   Jaundice (4-35%).
*   Hepatic bruit (6-25%).

## Paraneoplastic manifestations
### Hypoglycemia
#### Type A
*   Occurs in later stages of HCC.
*   Due to malignant infiltration of liver inability to store glycogen in liver
    *   → Glycopenia (milder and common).
*   Common with other tumors as well.

#### Type B
*   Seen in <5%.
*   Seen in early stages.
*   Defective processing of pre-insulin like GF-α by malignant hepatocytes
    *   → ↑ insulin-like activity → Severe hypoglycemia.

### Polycythemia
*   Occurs in <10%.
*   Due to production of EPO/EPO like substance.

### Others
*   Hypercalcemia: PTHrP.
*   Pityriasis rotunda: Hyperpigmented, scaly lesions.
*   Carcinoid syndrome.
*   Hypertension.
*   Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
*   Neuropathy.

## Diagnosis
i. Serum tumor markers.
ii. Imaging.
iii. HPE: Risk of tumor seeding, hence avoided.

## Serum tumor markers
*   Not diagnostic for HCC alone.
*   Complementary with other findings.
*   monitoring:
    *   AFP: Supplemented with imaging.
    *   Fucosylated AFP/AFP L3.
    *   Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin: Prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II (PIVKA II).
    *   Others: GALAD (Gender, age, L3 AFP, DES-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) and liquid biopsy (Circulating tumor DNA or methylated DNA) are important ones.

### AFP
*   Alpha 1-globulin: High amounts in fetal serum.
*   Diagnosis:
    *   >10,0000 ng/ml diagnostic.
    *   >400 ng/mL in association with a liver mass.
    *   Surveillance: 6th monthly USG and AFP (Sensitivity of >10.9 ng/ml) monitoring.
    *   AFP >1000ng/ml: Poor prognosis.
    *   >500 ng/ml: Post transplant recurrence.
    *   False positive: Hepatoblastoma, endodermal tumors, NSGCT, pregnancy, acute liver failure, gastric tumors, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

## Imaging
*   Diagnostic dynamic contrast imaging of the liver.
*   Diagnostic imaging criteria:
    *   Arterial phase hyperenhancement.
    *   In venous phase (VP), delayed phase (DP) washout.
    *   +/- capsular enhancement.
    *   >1 cm is diagnostic.
*   LIRADS: LRI (Benign) to LRS (malignant).
*   monitor in 6 months: No progress then it means it is stable.

### USG
*   most effective for screening but is operator dependent.
*   Hypoechoic with capsule.
*   Smaller can be hyperechoic: Focal fat or hemangioma.
*   Right hemidiaphragm needs careful imaging.

### CT
*   Dynamic CT shows hyperenhancement in the arterial phase loss of enhancement and capsular enhancement in venous and delayed phase.
*   >2 cm: Diagnostic.
*   <1 cm: <30% chances.
*   Biopsy:
    *   Only if uncharacteristic imaging and > 1 cm.
    *   Seeding can occur.

### MRI
*   Similar: Dynamic CT.
*   Ta images: Hyperintense.
*   Hyperintensity on diffusion weighted images.
*   Gadolinium contrast agents: Gadoxetic acid.

## Summary of imaging
*   USG: For screening.
*   Contrast CT/MRI: For diagnosis.
*   Lesion >2cm: CT chest to rule out lung metastasis.
*   Vascular invasion/elevated AFP/> 2cm lesion: Pelvic CT, bone scans work for metastasis.
*   No role for PET CT in HCC.

## Pathology
### Gross
*   Nodular: m/c is cirrhotic.
*   massive: mass with satellite lesion in non cirrhotic young, can rupture.
*   Infiltrating: Looks like regenerating nodules, minute nodules.

        *   Bile production is the hallmark of HCC.
    *   Acinar:
        *   Gland like structure.
        *   malignant cells surrounding the bile duct.
        *   Bile production present.

## moderately differentiated

## Introduction

### Bile acid secretion:

### Anatomy of biliary apparatus

![Anatomy of Biliary Apparatus Diagram](image2.png)

*   Bile secretion starts from 4th month of gestation and continues.
*   Bile acid (BA) is synonymous to bile.
*   Bile acids constitutes >70% of bile.
*   Substrate of bile acid: Cholesterol (>50%).
*   Site of bile acid synthesis: Pericentral hepatocytes.
*   Absorption, reconjugation, secretion: Periportal hepatocytes.
*   Pericentral hepatocytes → Synthesise bile acids → Flows into the biliary canaliculus → Into the bile duct → Into the gall bladder.
*   Bile is a complex lipid-rich micellar solution, isosmotic with plasma.
*   Composition: Water, inorganic electrolytes, organic solutes (Bile acids >70%, phospholipids, cholesterol, bile pigments), xenobiotics.
*   Bile acid is responsible to the bile flow.
*   Vectorial movement of bile acid is responsible for the osmotic gradient that causes a solvent drag.
*   Bile is a dark green to yellowish brown fluid.
*   Stored in the gall bladder.
*   Secreted into the duodenum.

## Physical properties:

*   volume of hepatic bile secreted: 500-600 mL/day
*   Hepatic bile: PH 7.4, colour is golden yellow.
*   Bladder bile: PH 6.8 colour is green dark to yellow (Darker).

## Functions of bile acids:

*   Induce bile flow and hepatic secretion of biliary lipids (Phospholipid, cholesterol, xenobiotics).
*   Digestion of dietary fats.
*   Intestinal absorption of cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins.
*   Protein digestion by accelerating protein hydrolysis by pancreatic proteases.
*   maintain cholesterol homeostasis:
    *   Promote cholesterol intake.
    *   Promote cholesterol elimination.
    *   major route for elimination of cholesterol
*   Promote hepatic secretion of cholesterol into bile by inducing bile flow and soluble biliary cholesterol.
*   Antimicrobial defence mechanisms: Bile is bacteriostatic.
*   Prevent formation of calcium gallstones and enteric hyperoxaluria associated kidney stones.
*   Acts as hormones to regulate the enterohepatic circulation: Important role in lipids, proteins and glucose metabolism.
*   Note: Bile acids → ↓ Bile flow.

## Types of bile acids:

![Bile Acid Types Diagram](image3.png)

*   Primary bile acids: Cholic acid.
*   Chenodeoxycholic acid.
*   Primary bile acids: Produced from pericentral hepatocytes.

---

## Secondary bile acids:

*   In ileum and colon, bacteria acts upon the primary bile acids and converts it into secondary bile acids.
*   Lithocholic acid
    *   Hepatotoxic if unconjugated
    *   Gets converted to sulfa-lithocholic acid which either gets excreted in feces or if absorbed, gets excreted via urine.

## Bile acid synthesis

Pathways of production of bile acids : Synthesized from cholesterol in pericentral hepatocytes. mainly by a pathways:

*   **Classical/neutral pathway**
    *   Responsible for 90% bile acid synthesis.
    *   Enzyme: Cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase or CYP7A1.
    *   CYP7A: Rate limiting step for the classical pathway.
    *   Predominant in adults.
    *   Favours cholic acid (CA) synthesis.
*   **Alternative/acidic pathway**
    *   Responsible for 10% bile acid synthesis.
    *   Enzyme: Oxysterol 7-α-hydroxylase or CYP7B1.
    *   Predominant in neonates.
    *   Favours chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) synthesis.
    *   Not regulated by bile acids.
    *   Controlled by cholesterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

![Bile Acid Synthesis Pathways Diagram](image4.png)

## Feedback mechanism:

FXR in ileum detects the amount of bile acid coming into the ileum → Gets bound to bile acid → Releases FGF-19 → Goes into portal vein → Into the liver → Acts on hepatocyte → Translational and post translational feedback for decreasing CYP7A1 → Inhibit bile acid synthesis.

## Conjugation:

Before secretion into the bile canaliculus:

*   Conjugation with glycine or taurine.
*   Causes hydrophilicity.
*   No passive diffusion of bile acids.
*   Specific membrane carrier required.
*   maintain high intraluminal concentrations of bile acids: Facilitate lipid digestion and absorption.

## Bile acid secretion:

![Bile Acid Secretion Diagram](image5.png)

## Regulation of synthesis:

Promoters (Increase expression of CYP7A1):

*   FXR: Farnesoid & receptor on ileal enterocyte.
*   HNF4: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4.
*   FGF-19: Fibroblast growth factor.
*   LRH: Liver receptor homologue.

Inhibitors (Negative feedback OF CYP7A1):

*   FXR: Indirectly suppress CYP7A1.
*   SHP: Small heterodromer partner.
*   FGFR4: Fibroblast growth factor receptor.
*   β-Klotho: Co-receptor of FGFR4.

## Enterohepatic circulation

Anatomic components:

*   Liver: Reuptake of primary and secondary bile acids.
*   Biliary tract: Conduit for transport.
*   Gallbladder: Storage of bile acid.
*   Small intestine: Action of bile acid/absorption.
*   Portal venous circulation: Transport.
*   To a lesser extent, colon, systemic circulation and kidneys are involved.

Fundamental levels:

*   Storage chambers: Gall bladder, small bowel (Bile stored in proximal small bowel post cholecystectomy).
*   Valves: Sphincter of Oddi, ileocaecal valve.
*   mechanical pumps: Bile canaliculus tract, small bowel.
*   Chemical pumps:
    *   Hepatocyte.
    *   Cholangiocyte.
    *   Ileocyte.

The enterohepatic circulation recycles bile salts between the small intestine and the liver.

Efficient intestinal reabsorption and hepatic extraction of bile acids permit effective recycling and conservation.

Bile salts in the intestine lumen are absorbed via four pathways:

a. Passive diffusion (very little).
b. An active carrier-mediated process: ASBT.

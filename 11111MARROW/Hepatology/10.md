# HEPATITIS B

## Structure and life cycle
**Discovery of hepatitis B virus (HBV)** in 1960 by Dr. Bumborg as Australia antigen.

**Structure of hepatitis B virus:**
dsDNA virus.
Family: Type I hepadnaviridae.
Size: 42 nm, 3.2 kb virus.

**4 open reading frames with overlapping genes:**
1. Core gene: Nucleocapsid (c, e antigen).
2. S gene: Envelope (S, M, L proteins).
3. X gene: X protein (Transactivating property → Can lead to HCC).
4. P gene: Encodes for DNA Polymerase (Replication), largest gene.

**Note:**
It uses reverse transcriptase to transform from RNA to dsDNA.

**Principal HBV proteins and Envelope proteins of HBV**

| Principal HBV proteins | |
|---|---|
| S | Small surface protein |
| M | Middle surface protein |
| L | Large surface protein |
| HBc | Core protein |
| HBeAg | Secreted e antigen |
| pol | Polymerase |
| HBx | X protein (nonsecreted) |

## Chronic Hepatitis

**Dane particles/viral particles:**
Genome:
* Partially ds relaxed circular DNA.
* "-" strand is complete.
* 5' end of "-" strand: Polymerase.
* "+" strand: Incomplete, has a primer.
* Size: 42 nm
* Pre C region: "e" antigen (Immunotolerising property, soluble, present in blood, marker of replication).
* C region: Core antigen (Not soluble, not present in blood).

Inner shell: Nucleocapsid
Envelope: 3 types of proteins (S, M, L).
Less in number compared to subviral particles.

Subviral particles:
* Spheres/filaments.
* Surface/envelope proteins, germ free virion.
* No dsDNA.

**Note:**
X protein: Has transactivating properties → Causes HCC.
S gene has 3 components: Pre S1 (Large), pre S2 (medium) & S (Small).
e antigen: Has immunotolerising property.

## Life cycle:
1. Hepatitis B virus entry.
2. HBV capsid transport:
    * Excapsidation → Nucleocapsid is transported into nucleus.
    * Release of rsDNA (Relaxed circular DNA): Can either form dsDNA or CCC DNA.
    * dsDNA: Integrates into human genome.
3. CCC DNA formation:
    * Exclusively produced from rcDNA.
    * Gives rise to mRNA (Pregenomic, subgenomic, X mRNA).
    * Pregenomic mRNA: 3.5 Kb, forms polymerase and core proteins.
    * Subgenomic mRNA: 2.4/2.1 kb, forms envelope/surface proteins.
    * X mRNA: 0.7 kb, comes back into CCC DNA.
    * RNAase H in cytoplasm: Causes lysis of RNA.

## Mutations
**S gene mutation:**
* mutation in 'a' subtype: Positions 124, 147.
* Failure of neutralization by hepatitis B immunoglobulin/vaccination.

* 2-3%: Escape mutants.

**Core gene mutation:**
* 189% mutation:
    * Absent HBeAg (Precore mutant).
    * 'e' antigen has immunotolerising property.
    * Absence of 'e' antigen: Severe hepatitis.

**1762 and 1764 mutation:**
* Decrease HBeAg by 70%.
* Genotype 'c': Hepatocellular carcinoma.
* Block recognition of HBV by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Immune escape).

**HBV DNA polymerase mutation:**
* No proof reading capacity.
* Decreased binding of drugs: Decreased efficacy.

## Serology of hepatitis B
**00:27:05**

**Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg):**
* Serological hallmark.
* 1-10 weeks after exposure.
* 1st antigen detected in blood.
* Becomes negative within 3 months.
* Recovery: Life long anti HBs antibody.
* Persists >6 months: Chronicity.
* HBsAg and anti HBs antibody present: multiple subtypes (Rare).

**Note:**
Best test for epidemiological surveillance of hepatitis B is IgG core antibody.

## Hepatitis B core antigen (Anti HBc) and (Anti HBC) antibody:
* HBcAg not detected but antibody is present.
* Acute infection: Anti-HBc IgM antibody.
* Window period: 1 month of HBsAg.
* >1 month: IgM decreases and IgG increases.
* Exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B : High IgM.
* IgG anti-HBc + Anti HbS: Recovered.
* IgG anti-HBC + HBSAg: Chronic disease.
* IgG anti-HBc alone: Occult infection.

## Hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg) and (Anti-HBe) antibody:
* HBeAg:
    * Precore protein from pre-genomic RNA.
    * Indicates replication and infectivity.
    * Appears just after HBsAg.
    * HBeAg → Anti HBe antibody: Remission of liver disease.
    * Precore mutants: No HBeAg but anti HBe antibody is present.
    * Bad prognosis.

## Clinical presentation
**00:35:50**
Incubation period: 60-90 days.

**Clinical features:**
* Prodromal symptoms → Hepatitis.
* Prodromal symptoms: malaise, nausea, vomiting, fever, arthritis, rash.
* Jaundice (30%).
* 70%: Anicteric hepatitis.
* Recovery: 1-3 months.

**Extrahepatic manifestations:**
* Due'to immune complex deposition (Type III hypersensitivity reaction).
* Arthritis.
* Dermatitis.
* Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) : 30% cases with PAN are HBV positive.
* Glomerulonephritis: membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) → Nephrotic syndrome.
* Cryoglobulinemia.

**Serology:**
* HBsAg: Disappear within 12 weeks.
    * Persists >3 months → Chronicity.
* IgM Hbc antibody: Increases in acute cases as well as flares.
* HBV DNA levels: High in chronic hepatitis, low in acute.
* Quantitative HBsAg: very high in chronic, low in acute.

**Histopathology:**

* Deposition of core antigens, HBsAg particle in endoplasmic reticulum.
* No steatosis.

## Natural history
**00:43:47**

The variation in the natural history of the disease is due to 'e' antigen.
* Wild virus: 'e' antigen positive → On chronic condition they become anti 'e' positive and anti 'e' negative.
* Precore mutant: They are denovo 'e' antigen negative but anti 'e' positive.

**Types of natural history:**
* There are a types of natural history:
    1. Acquired infection in childhood.
    2. Acquired infection in adult.

**Phases of natural history:**
Child gets infected with hepatitis infection → But the immune system is naive → So no immune response (Immune tolerant phase) → DNA high, AST and ALT normal → Later in life as the immune response develops → Hepatocytes are affected and DNA levels come down → AST and ALT levels go up (Immune reactive phase) → Body controls the hepatocytes and the levels of DNA and AST, ALT comes down (Immune inactive carrier phase) → Later due to any infection or cancer chemotherapy, the virus gets reactivated (Immune reactive phase).

**Classification based on HbeAg:**
* HbeAg positive:
    * HbeAg positive with infection: ↑ DNA, ↑ALT.
    * HbeAg positive with hepatitis: ↑ DNA, ↑ ALT.
* HbeAg negative:
    * HbeAg negative with infection: ↑ DNA, ↓ALT.
    * HbeAg negative with hepatitis: ↑ DNA, ↑ ALT.

**General classification:**
* HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection (Immune tolerance).
* HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (Immune clearance).
* HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection (Inactive carrier state).
* HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (Reactivation).
* HBsAg-negative phase.

    * Highest risk: Intrapartum.

    * HBV DNA >200,000 IU/mL → Antivirals: 28 to 32 weeks.
    * Can stop soon after delivery or can be given till 1 month.
    * Zero % chance if immunoprophylaxis is combined with nucleotide analogue.
* Postpartum flares: 20% of women, and monitoring enzyme and DNA levels in the first 3 to 6 months.

# MARROW 
- 1st endocrine gland to be formed - at 3-4weeks -- hormone at 11weeks (Tg at 29days)
- endodermal derivative 
- floor of primitive pharynx 
- migrates along the **thyroglossal duct** (remnant is foramen caecum) , explaining rare **ectopic lingual thyroid** or **thyroglossal duct cysts**. (mc site is subhyoid) 
- structural and function unit is **follicles**  
- parafollicular cells (from ultimobranchial body -- partly neuroendocrine cells and partly 5th pharyngeal pouch)- CALCITONIN 
- TTF-1 , TTF-2 , PAX-8 --> defect --> congenital hypothyroid 
	- TTF-1 --> choreoathetosis + hypothyroid 
	- TTF-2 --> hypothyroid + choanal atresia and spiky hair 
	- PAX-8 --> thyroid dysgenesis , unilateral renal agenesis 
- HORMONE SYNTHESIS 
	- 1 -> iodide transport **across Basolateral membrane** (1st needs TSH and TSH-R binding)
		- TSH competes with Dopamine , steroid and somatostatin for binding 
		- GPCR via cAMP-PKA pathway 
		- needs Na-I symporter (NIS) (also seen in breast, salivary gland, placenta) NIS needed for thyroid scanning 
		- I123 for scan, I131 for treatment 
	- 2 -> Iodine transport across apical membrane -- Iodide-chloride antiporter **(pendrin)** --> pendrid syndrome (goitre + SNHL)
	- 3 -> organification (I to I2) --> needs TPO and DUOX2 (provides H2O2) 
	- 4 -> Iodination -> Thyroglobulin (with tyrosine residues) --> adding Iodine to residues --> enzyme independent steps --> MIT and DIT made
	- 5-> coupling --> MIT+DIT --> T3, DIT+DIT --> T4 (needs TPO)
	- 6-> Tg back into follicular epithelial  cells 
	- 7-> Proteolysis and release (inhibited by Iodides) by crossing basolateral membrane 
	- 8 -> Peripheral T4->T3 (by Deiodinase or selenoiodinase ) -->induced by hypothyroid 
		- type 2 deiodinase is mc 
			- also in thyroid, CNS, heart, skeletal 
		- inhibited by -- amiodarone , PTU, Propanalol, steroids 
		- type 1 deiodinase --> liver, kidney , thyroid  
			- for rT3 degradation --> important in Thyrotoxicosis 
		- type 3 deiodinase --> T4-> rT3 
			- normally in placenta, small in liver and muscle 
- Iodine intake -- adults 150ug, pregnant -220 
- in iodine replete - urinary iodide --> 200ug/day or 100ug/L 
- never TFT in 
	- sick or critical illness 
	- fasting 
	- chronic systemic illness 
	- Iodide consumption 
	- as DI-2 inhibited --> DI-3 raised --> T4->rT3 --> **T4 normal, T3 low rT3 high, normal TSH** --> sick euthyroid syndrome 
- T4 vs T3 
	- 80% T3 is formed in periphery only 20% in gland 
	- 15:1 -->T4:T3 in Tg
	- 10:1 --> T4:T3 in colloid or secreted ratio 
	- 4:1 T3:T4 potency 
	- fT3 is 0.3-0.4% fT4 is 0.02-0.03% 
	- T3 t1/2 1 day 
	- T4 t1/2 1 week
- mechanism  intranuclear receptor --> heterodimer - co-repressor dissociate and co-activator binding 
- TFT interpretation 
	- bound to TBG 70%, 20% albumin , 10% transthyretin 
	- MCT8 deficit --> Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome - severe neurologic deficit as thyroid cannot enter nerve cells + may have thyrotoxicosis 
	- if T3 and T4 raised --> **Hyperthyroxinemia** --> maybe **Euthyroid** (if normal Ft3 Ft4 levels) or **thyrotoxicosis** ( raised T3, T4 only)
		- Euthyroid Hyperthyroxinemia 
			- excess TBG - hereditary - X-linked 
				- acquire -- OCPs, pregnancy , tamoxifen , chronic active hepatitis 
			- Drugs 
				- T4->T3 blockers (steroid, propanalol, amiodarone, PTU )
			- Resistant to thyroid hormone 
				- raised level but not toxic as action is euthyroidism 
				- TR alpha(heart) and beta(in liver and pituitary )
				- resistant in mostly Beta --> but alpha acting so cardiac toxicity maybe seen 
	- Thyrotoxicosis 
		- overworking thyroid --> hyperthyroidism 
		- normal gland -- euthyroidism 
	- TSH 
		- by chemi-illuminesence assay 4th gen 
		- 0.5-5 mIU/L is normal 
		- dont do TSH alone -- do with fT3, fT4 
		- 
	- fT3 5pmol/l, ft4 20pmol/l normal 
- the thyroid hormone 
	- receptor - 
		- TRA1 - in heart 
		- TRA2- everywhere 
		- TRB1 - Liver 
		- TRB2 - pituitary 
	- most important function - maintains BMR 
	- **both increased and decreased T3,T4 --> raise BP**
		- in hypothyroid -- raised peripheral resistant --> diastolic hypertension 
		- hyperthyroidism -- high cardiac output --> increase SBP 
	- Glucose 
		- increase glucose production - gluconeogenesis 
		- increased glucose uptake in tissues 
		- insulin resistance in hypothyroid -- as impaired glucose uptake 
	- cholesterol clearance , lipolysis 
			- reduced in hypothyroid --> hypercholesterolemia 
	- proteolysis 
	- bone growth 
	- responsive to catecholamine indirectly 
	- myelination of CNS 
	- uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation -- thermiogenesis 
	- beta caroten -> vitamin A 
	- stimulates erythropoiesis 

# thyroiditis
- inflammation of thyroid gland 
- acute, subacute , chronic 
- acute/ chronic - normal TFT 
- acute - child 
	- mc infections -- staphylococcus > streptococci  of pyriform  
	- painful swelling 
	- radiation or trauma maybe causes 
- chronic - elderly 
- subacute 
	- aka De quervain or viral or granulomatous 
	- women 30-50 
	- no viral implicated 
	- HLA B35 
	- thyrotoxicosis --> hypothyroid --> recovery 
	- raised t3 t4 (ratio <15) (if more than 20--> graves) 
	- sometimes permanent hypothyroid (15% cases) 
	- fever + painful thyroid 
	- sore throat, neck pain

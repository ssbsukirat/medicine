# Human Immunodeficiency Virus Disease

## Overview of HIV/AIDS

- **First Recognition**:
    - Summer 1981 in the United States.
    - Reported by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    - Unexplained occurrence of _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ pneumonia (PCP) in five previously healthy homosexual men in Los Angeles.
    - Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) with or without PCP and other opportunistic infections in 26 previously healthy homosexual men in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.
    - Soon recognized in injection drug users (male and female), hemophiliacs, blood transfusion recipients, female sexual partners of men with AIDS, and infants born to mothers with AIDS.
- **Causative Agent**:
    - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolated in 1983 from a patient with lymphadenopathy.
    - Demonstrated as the causative agent of AIDS by 1984.
- **Epidemic Scope**:
    - Sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed in 1985, aiding in understanding the epidemic's scope.
    - Explosion of information in HIV virology, pathogenesis, treatment, opportunistic disease treatment/prophylaxis, and prevention.
    - Purpose of the chapter: present current information on pandemic scope, pathogenesis, treatment, prevention, and vaccine development.
    - Aim: provide solid scientific basis and practical clinical guidelines for HIV care.

## Classification of HIV Infection and AIDS

- **CDC Classification System**:
    - Categorizes patients based on clinical conditions and CD4+ T lymphocyte count.
    - Confirmed HIV case classified into five stages: 0, 1, 2, 3, or unknown (U).
    - **Stage 0**: Negative HIV test within 6 months of first HIV diagnosis; remains 0 until 6 months after diagnosis.
    - **Stage 3 (Advanced HIV disease/AIDS)**:
        - Diagnosed if one or more specific opportunistic illness has occurred.
        - Otherwise determined by CD4+ T lymphocyte test results and immunologic criteria.
    - **Stage U**: If criteria do not apply (e.g., missing CD4+ T lymphocyte results).
- **Purpose of Definition**:
    - Complex and comprehensive criteria established for surveillance, not practical patient care.
    - Clinician should view HIV disease as a spectrum from primary infection (with/without acute syndrome) to asymptomatic stage to advanced opportunistic disease stages.

|AIDS|(defined by opportunistic illness regardless of CD4 count)||

## Etiologic Agent

- **Family and Subfamily**:
    - HIV belongs to the family _Retroviridae_ and subfamily _lentiviruses_.
    - Nononcogenic lentiviruses cause disease in other animal species (sheep, horses, goats, cattle, cats, monkeys).
- **Human Retroviruses**:
    - Four known to cause human disease:
        - Human T lymphotropic viruses (HTLV)-1 and HTLV-2: transforming retroviruses.
        - Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV)-1 and HIV-2: cause cytopathic effects (directly or indirectly).
- **HIV-1 vs. HIV-2**:
    - **HIV-1**: Most common cause of HIV disease worldwide, especially in the United States.
        - Comprises several subtypes with different geographic distributions.
        - Groups: M, N, O, P.
        - Primarily derived from chimpanzees and/or gorillas.
        - Group M viruses primarily cause the AIDS pandemic.
        - Groups O and P, and N, are less widespread and rarer, primarily found in Cameroon or travelers from there.
    - **HIV-2**: First identified in 1986 in West African patients.
        - Originally confined to West Africa, but cases traced globally.
        - Groups: A through H.
        - Derived from sooty mangabeys.
        - Causes much more localized epidemics.
- **Virion Morphology**:
    - Icosahedral structure with numerous external spikes formed by two major envelope proteins: external gp120 and transmembrane gp41.
    - HIV envelope exists as a trimeric heterodimer.
    - Buds from infected cell surface, incorporating host cellular proteins into its lipid bilayer.
    - HIV-1 structure includes gp120 envelope, gp41 transmembrane components, genomic RNA, reverse transcriptase enzyme, p18(17) inner membrane (matrix), and p24 core protein (capsid).

## Replication Cycle of HIV

- **RNA Virus**:
    - Hallmark: reverse transcription of genomic RNA to DNA by reverse transcriptase enzyme.
- **Entry into Host Cell**:
    - Begins with high-affinity binding of gp120 protein to CD4 molecule on host cell surface.
    - CD4 molecule: 55-kDa protein on helper T lymphocytes.
    - Gp120 undergoes conformational change after CD4 binding, facilitating binding to one of two major co-receptors: CCR5 or CXCR4.
    - Co-receptors are G protein–coupled receptors; their usage determines viral cellular tropism.
    - Cell-to-cell spread facilitated by accessory molecules like DC-SIGN (C-type lectin receptor on dendritic cells) that bind to gp120, spreading virus to CD4+ T cells.
    - Fusion with host cell membrane occurs via newly exposed gp41 molecule penetrating plasma membrane.
- **Post-Fusion Events**:
    - Uncoating of capsid protein shell initiated.
    - Formation of preintegration complex: viral RNA, enzymes, accessory proteins, surrounded by capsid and matrix proteins.
    - This complex constitutes the HIV replication complex, with outer capsid shell supporting reverse transcription.
    - Preintegration complex traverses cytoplasm to nucleus.
    - Viral reverse transcriptase enzyme catalyzes reverse transcription of genomic RNA into double-stranded HIV proviral DNA.
- **Host Restriction Factors**:
    - Cytoplasmic tripartite motif-containing protein 5-α (TRIM5-α): interacts with retroviral capsids, causing premature disassembly and innate immune response induction.
    - Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme (APOBEC3) family: inhibits virus infection after entry, prior to nucleus.
        - Incorporated into virions, released into cytoplasm of newly infected cell.
        - Bind to single minus-strand DNA intermediate and deaminate viral cytidine, causing hypermutation.
        - HIV protects itself: viral protein Vif targets APOBEC3 for proteasomal degradation.
    - SAMHD1: post-entry host factor preventing reverse transcription by depleting dNTP pools.
    - Myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2) (Type I interferon (IFN)-induced): inhibits HIV-1 nuclear entry.
- **Integration and Transcription**:
    - Viral DNA accesses nuclear pore and integrates into host cell chromosomes via integrase enzyme upon cell activation.
    - Integration preferentially occurs in active transcription regions and regional hotspots.
    - Provirus may remain latent or express varying levels of gene expression up to active transcription and virus production, depending on infected cell's metabolic state.
    - Cellular activation is critical for HIV replication and pathogenesis.
        - Incomplete reverse-transcribed DNA intermediates are labile in quiescent cells and do not integrate efficiently unless activation occurs.
        - Activation required for initiation of integrated proviral DNA transcription into genomic or mRNA.
        - Activation of HIV expression from latency depends on cellular and viral factors.
- **Protein Translation and Virion Assembly**:
    - HIV mRNA translated into proteins, undergoing modification (glycosylation, myristoylation, phosphorylation, cleavage).
    - Viral particle formed by assembly of HIV proteins, enzymes, genomic RNA at plasma membrane.
    - Budding of progeny virion through host cell membrane acquires external envelope.
    - Host restriction factor tetherin can inhibit release of budding particles.
        - HIV accessory protein Vpu counteracts tetherin effect.
    - During or after budding, virally encoded protease catalyzes cleavage of gag-pol precursor to yield mature virion.
- **Therapeutic Targets**:
    - Each point in replication cycle is a target for therapeutic intervention.
    - Reverse transcriptase, protease, integrase enzymes, and virus-target cell binding/fusion susceptible to pharmacologic disruption.

## HIV Genome

- **Organization**:
    - Like other retroviruses, HIV-1 has genes encoding structural proteins:
        - **gag**: encodes proteins forming the virion core (including p24 antigen).
        - **pol**: encodes enzymes for protease processing, reverse transcription, and integration.
        - **env**: encodes envelope glycoproteins.
    - More complex than nonprimate retroviruses, contains at least six other regulatory genes:
        - **tat, rev, nef, vif, vpr, vpu**.
        - Code for proteins modifying host cell to enhance virus growth and regulate viral gene expression.
        - Several play a role in HIV disease pathogenesis.
    - Flanking genes are **long terminal repeats (LTRs)**, containing regulatory elements for gene expression.
- **HIV-1 vs. HIV-2 Genomic Difference**:
    - HIV-2 lacks the **vpu** gene.
    - HIV-2 has a **vpx** gene not found in HIV-1.

## Molecular Heterogeneity of HIV-1

- **Sequence Diversity**:
    - Varying levels of sequence diversity across all regions of viral genome.
    - Envelope protein coding sequences differ from a few percent (within individual) to >50% (between groups M, N, O, P).
    - Changes cluster in hypervariable regions.
- **Evolution Mechanisms**:
    - Simple base substitution.
    - Insertions and deletions.
    - Recombination.
    - Gain and loss of glycosylation sites.
- **Source of Diversity**:
    - Limited fidelity of reverse transcriptase (copying errors).
    - Immune pressure and functional constraints influence regional variation.
        - Envelope: highly variable due to immune selective pressure (antibodies, cytolytic T lymphocytes).
        - Reverse transcriptase: relatively conserved, especially active site.
- **Contrast with HTLV-1/2**:
    - Extraordinary variability of HIV-1 contrasts with relative stability of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.
- **HIV-1 Groups and Subtypes**:
    - Four groups (M, N, O, P) from separate chimpanzee-to-human (or gorilla-to-human for O and P) transfers.
    - **Group M (major)**: Responsible for most global infections.
        - Diversified into subtypes (clades) and intersubtype recombinant forms (CRFs).
        - Most closely related to viruses from _Pan troglodytes troglodytes_ (chimpanzee subspecies).
        - Group O and P viruses are closest to Cameroonian gorillas.
        - Comprises ten subtypes (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L) and >100 known CRFs.
        - CRFs generated by individual infection with two subtypes that recombine for selective advantage.
            - Highly prevalent: CRF01_AE (Southeast Asia), CRF02_AG (West/Central Africa).
    - **Subtype C**: Dominates global pandemic (~50% of prevalent infections).
        - Most infections in sub-Saharan Africa (where 2/3 of global HIV population resides).
        - 98% of HIV-1 isolates in South Africa are subtype C.
        - > 95% of infections in India are subtype C.
            
        - Speculation about higher transmissibility lacks solid data.
    - **Subtype B**: Overwhelmingly predominant in the United States, Canada, parts of South America, Western Europe, and Australia.
        - Thought to be due to a founder effect in the late 1970s.
- **Implications of Diversity**:
    - Differential rates of transmission.
    - Rates of disease progression.
    - Development of antiretroviral drug resistance.
    - Formidable obstacle to HIV vaccine development (need broad protective responses).

### Global Geographic Distribution of HIV-1 Subtypes and Recombinant Forms

(Note: Figure 202-6 is mentioned, but the full content of the map cannot be transcribed into text. The text provides a summary.)

- Nine strains account for the vast majority of global HIV infections:
    - HIV-1 subtypes: A, B, C, D, F, G.
    - CRFs: CRF01_AE, CRF02_AG, CRF07_BC.
- **Subtype C**: ~50% of prevalent infections worldwide.
    - Sub-Saharan Africa: most infections (smaller proportions of A, D, CRF02_AG).
    - South Africa: 98% of isolates.
    - India: >95% of infections.
- **CRF01_AE**: Most infections in South and Southeast Asia.
- **Subtype B**: Predominant in United States, Canada, parts of South America, Western Europe, Australia.
- Co-circulating viral subtypes lead to new CRFs, especially in areas of overlap or injection drug use epidemics.

## Transmission

- **Primary Modes**:
    - Sexual contact (heterosexual and male-to-male).
    - Blood and blood products.
    - Infected mothers to infants (intrapartum, perinatally, or via breast milk).
- **No Other Documented Modality**:
    - After four decades, no evidence of transmission by other means.

### Estimated Per-Act Probability of Acquiring HIV from an Infected Source, By Exposure Act

(Note: Table 202-3 is mentioned and its data is referenced throughout the text for various transmission modes.)

|Exposure Act|Estimated Per-Act Risk of Acquiring HIV (%)|
|:--|:--|
|Unprotected receptive anal intercourse|~1.4|
|Injection drug use (contaminated needle)|~0.6|
|Male-to-female vaginal intercourse|0.08|
|Female-to-male vaginal intercourse|0.04|
|Transfusion of contaminated blood products|>90|
|Percutaneous injury (healthcare worker)|~0.23|
|Mucous membrane exposure (healthcare worker)|~0.09|
|Nonintact skin exposure (healthcare worker)|<0.09|
|Oral sex|Extremely low (but documented cases exist)|

### Sexual Transmission

- **Predominant Mode**:
    - Most common mode worldwide.
    - Heterosexual transmission dominates in developing countries.
    - Male-to-male sexual transmission dominates in many Western countries.
- **Efficiency**:
    - Generally inefficient.
    - Low per-act risk without antiretrovirals or condoms.
- **Viral Presence**:
    - Demonstrated in seminal fluid (infected mononuclear cells and cell-free).
    - Concentrates in seminal fluid with increased lymphocytes/monocytes (e.g., genital inflammatory states like urethritis, epididymitis, associated with other STIs).
    - Demonstrated in cervical smears and vaginal fluid.
- **Anal Intercourse**:
    - Higher risk for unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) compared to unprotected receptive vaginal intercourse.
    - Per-act risk estimated ~1.4% for URAI.
    - Reasons for higher risk: thin, fragile rectal mucosal membrane; micro-trauma.
    - Anal douching and traumatizing practices increase risk.
    - Modalities of infection: direct inoculation into blood (trauma), infection of susceptible cells (e.g., Langerhans cells) in mucosa.
    - Insertive anal intercourse also increases risk for receptive partner compared to insertive vaginal intercourse.
- **Vaginal Intercourse**:
    - Male-to-female transmission more efficient than female-to-male.
    - Differences possibly due to prolonged exposure of vaginal/cervical mucosa to infected seminal fluid; endometrium exposure.
    - Male partner's penis/urethral orifice exposed relatively briefly.
- **Cofactors**:
    - **Other STIs**: Strongly associated with HIV transmission.
        - Genital ulcerations (e.g., _Treponema pallidum_, _Haemophilus ducreyi_, herpes simplex virus (HSV)): increase susceptibility and infectivity.
        - Non-ulcerative inflammatory STIs (e.g., _Chlamydia trachomatis_, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, _Trichomonas vaginalis_): increased transmission risk.
        - Bacterial vaginosis: linked to increased transmission risk.
        - Treating STIs and genital tract syndromes may prevent HIV transmission, particularly in low HIV prevalence populations.
        - HSV treatment: not shown to reduce HIV acquisition despite ulcer healing, likely due to persisting HIV receptor-positive inflammatory cells.
- **Viral Load**:
    - Primary determinant of transmission risk.
    - Higher viral load in plasma leads to higher transmission risk.
    - Transmission rare when infected partner plasma level <1700 copies HIV RNA/mL, even with genital ulcer disease.
    - Highest per-coital act transmission rate during early HIV infection (high plasma HIV RNA) and advanced disease (high viral set points).
- **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**:
    - Dramatically reduces plasma viremia and transmission risk (treatment as prevention, TasP).
    - "Undetectable equals untransmittable" (U=U): if viral load is below detectable levels by conventional assays, essentially no chance of sexual transmission.
    - Applies to heterosexuals and men who have sex with men.
- **Male Circumcision**:
    - Associated with lower risk of HIV acquisition for heterosexual men.
    - Protective for men who have sex with men reporting mainly or only insertive sex.
    - Benefit reasons:
        - Increased susceptibility of uncircumcised men to ulcerative STIs.
        - Microtrauma to foreskin and glans penis.
        - Highly vascularized inner foreskin with high density of Langerhans cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages.
        - Moist environment under foreskin may promote microbial flora leading to higher target cell concentrations.
    - Also reduces HSV-2, HPV, genital ulcer disease in men, and HPV, genital ulcer disease, bacterial vaginosis, _Trichomonas vaginalis_ in female partners.
- **Oral Contraceptives**:
    - Some studies suggest association with increased HIV incidence, possibly due to drug-induced cervical mucosa changes.
    - Adolescent girls may be more susceptible due to immature genital tract with increased cervical ectopy.
- **Oral Sex**:
    - Much less efficient mode of transmission than anal or vaginal intercourse.
    - Extremely low incidence of transmission among discordant couples.
    - Well-documented reports of transmission from fellatio or cunnilingus.
    - "Completely safe" assumption not warranted.
- **Substance Use**:
    - Alcohol and illicit drug use associated with unsafe sexual behavior, increasing transmission risk.
    - Methamphetamine and "club drugs" (MDMA, ketamine, GHB, inhaled nitrites) sometimes with PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) associated with risky sexual practices, especially among men who have sex with men.

### Transmission Through Injection Drug Use

- **Method**:
    - Sharing injection paraphernalia (needles, syringes, water, cotton).
    - Parenteral transmission does not require IV puncture; subcutaneous ("skin popping") or intramuscular ("muscling") injections can transmit.
- **Risk Factors**:
    - Duration of injection drug use.
    - Frequency of needle sharing.
    - Number of partners with whom paraphernalia are shared.
    - Comorbid psychiatric conditions (e.g., antisocial personality disorder).
    - Use of injectable cocaine or smoked "crack".
    - Injection drug use in high HIV prevalence geographic areas.
- **Per-Act Risk**: ~0.6% with contaminated needle.

### Transmission by Transfused Blood and Blood Products

- **Risk prior to 1985**:
    - Vast majority of infections via contaminated blood/tissue in resource-rich countries occurred before spring 1985 (mandatory HIV-1 testing initiated).
    - > 90% of individuals exposed to contaminated blood products become infected.
        
    - Whole blood, packed red blood cells, platelets, leukocytes, plasma can transmit.
    - Hyperimmune gamma globulin, hepatitis B immune globulin, plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine, Rho immune globulin _not_ associated with transmission (processing inactivates/removes virus).
- **Current Risk in Developed Countries**:
    - Extremely small due to:
        - Screening blood donations for HIV-1/2 antibodies and HIV nucleic acid (NAT).
        - Careful donor selection (health history, risk behavior exclusion, self-deferral).
        - Screening for infections with shared risk factors (Hepatitis B/C, syphilis).
    - Hemophiliac infection risk virtually eliminated by screening and heat treatment of concentrates.
    - Estimated risk in US: ~1 in 2 million units.
    - Complete elimination unlikely given ~21 million components transfused annually in US.
- **Ongoing Threat in Developing Countries**:
    - Still a threat where routine screening is not universal.
    - Sporadic breakdowns in screening procedures reported.

### Occupational Transmission of HIV: Health Care Workers, Laboratory Workers, and the Health Care Setting

- **Risk**:
    - Small but definite occupational risk, especially with sharp objects.
    - > 300,000 healthcare workers stuck by sharps annually in US.
        
    - Global estimate: 1000 occupational HIV infections per year.
- **Documented US Cases**:
    - 58 documented cases of occupational HIV transmission to healthcare workers by CDC.
    - 150 possible transmissions.
    - Only one confirmed case since 1999 (laboratory technician, needle puncture, live HIV culture, 2008).
- **Exposure Types and Risks**:
    - Percutaneous injuries (needle stick/sharp object): ~0.23% risk from documented HIV-infected blood.
    - Mucous membrane contact: ~0.09% risk.
    - Nonintact skin contact: rare documented transmission, average risk not precisely determined but < mucous membrane exposure.
    - Intact skin transmission: not documented.
    - These risks apply if not treated with antiretroviral drugs within 24 hours.
    - Compare to HBV (6-30% in nonimmune, PEP >90% effective) and HCV (~1.8%).
- **Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**:
    - All healthcare workers with puncture wound or mucous membrane exposures to documented HIV-infected blood should receive combination ART.
    - Dramatically reduced puncture-related transmissions.
- **Potentially Infectious Body Fluids**:
    - Blood and visibly bloody body fluids.
    - Semen and vaginal secretions (not implicated in occupational transmission from patients to HCWs).
    - Cerebrospinal, synovial, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, and amniotic fluids.
    - Risk from these fluids/tissues unquantified, but probably considerably lower than blood.
    - Not considered infectious unless visibly bloody: feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, vomitus.
    - Rare cases of HIV transmission via human bites reported (not occupational).
- **Increased Risk Factors for Percutaneous Exposure**:
    - Large quantity of blood (e.g., visibly contaminated device, hollow-bore needle in vein/artery).
    - Deep injury.
    - Exposure to blood from untreated patients with high HIV levels.
- **HCW-to-Patient Transmission**:
    - Extremely low risk in developed countries, too low to measure accurately.
    - Retrospective studies of thousands of patients of HIV-infected providers (dentists, physicians, surgeons, obstetricians, gynecologists) found no linked transmissions other than already documented cases.
- **Patient-to-Patient Transmission**:
    - Rarely resulted from breaches in infection control, reuse of contaminated syringes, failure to sterilize instruments, hemodialysis equipment in hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient settings.
- **Importance**:
    - Underscores importance of universal precautions for all patients.

### Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV

- **Modalities**:
    - During pregnancy (fetus).
    - During delivery (perinatal).
    - Via breast-feeding.
- **Prevalence**:
    - Persistent form of transmission in certain developing countries.
    - Virologic analyses: HIV can be transmitted in 1st/2nd trimesters.
    - Most common in perinatal period.
    - Rwanda/DRC studies: 23-30% before birth, 50-65% during birth, 12-20% via breast-feeding.
- **Transmission Probability (Without ART)**:
    - 15-25% in industrialized countries.
    - 25-35% in developing countries (may relate to prenatal care, maternal disease stage/health).
- **Risk Factors**:
    - **High maternal plasma viremia**: best documented, risk increases linearly.
        - Very unlikely if mother's plasma viremia <1000 copies/mL.
        - Extremely unlikely if <50 copies/mL.
    - Closer human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match between mother and child.
    - Prolonged interval between membrane rupture and delivery.
    - Potential (but not consistently demonstrated): chorioamnionitis, STIs during pregnancy, illicit drug use, cigarette smoking, preterm delivery, obstetrical procedures (amniocentesis, amnioscopy, fetal scalp electrodes, episiotomy).
- **Impact of ART**:
    - Rate fallen to <1% in pregnant women receiving ART.
    - ART combined with cesarean section makes transmission extremely unusual in developed nations.
    - US Public Health Service and WHO recommend all HIV-infected pregnant women receive lifelong ART (for mother's health and perinatal prevention).
- **Breast-feeding**:
    - Important transmission modality in developing countries (prolonged breast-feeding).
    - Risk factors: detectable HIV in breast milk, mastitis, low maternal CD4+ T-cell counts, maternal vitamin A deficiency.
    - Risk highest in early months.
    - Exclusive breast-feeding reported lower risk than mixed feeding.
    - Developed countries: contraindicated (formulas available).
    - Developing countries: ART continuation during breast-feeding markedly diminishes risk.
    - ART for pregnant women should continue beyond pregnancy for life.

### Transmission by Other Body Fluids

- **Saliva**:
    - HIV isolated in low titers from small proportion of infected individuals.
    - No convincing evidence saliva transmits HIV (kissing or occupational).
    - Contains endogenous antiviral factors: HIV-specific immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM), large glycoproteins (mucins, thrombospondin 1) sequester HIV for clearance.
    - Soluble salivary factors (e.g., secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor - SLPI) inhibit HIV _in vitro_ (likely by targeting host cell receptors).
    - Higher salivary SLPI levels in breast-fed infants associated with decreased transmission.
    - Submandibular saliva may reduce infectivity by stripping gp120 from virions.
    - Saliva-mediated disruption/lysis of HIV-infected cells due to hypotonicity.
- **Human Bite**: Rare event, but can occur.
- **Tears, Sweat, Urine**: No evidence of transmission.
- **Other Body Fluids (potentially blood-contaminated)**:
    - Isolated cases of transmission reported.
    - Mostly in close relatives providing intensive nursing care without universal precautions.
    - Underscores importance of adhering to universal precautions when handling body fluids/wastes from HIV-infected individuals.

## Epidemiology

- **Global Pandemic Status**:
    - Cases reported from virtually every country.
    - Estimated 37.7 million individuals living with HIV in late 2020 (UNAIDS).
    - 95% in low- and middle-income countries.
    - ~50% female, 1.7 million children <15 years.
    - Global prevalence (age 15-49) in 2020: 0.7%.
    - Global prevalence increased nearly fivefold since 1990 due to continued new infections and life-prolonging ART.
- **New Infections (2020)**:
    - Estimated 1.5 million worldwide, including 150,000 children <15 years.
    - ~1/3 of new infections among 15-24 year olds.
    - 65% of new infections among certain high-risk populations: sex workers, injection drug users, transgender people, prisoners, gay men and other men who have sex with men, clients of sex workers, and their sexual partners.
- **Trends in New Infections**:
    - Fallen by 52% since peak in 1997.
    - Reflects progress in prevention and increased ART provision (reduces transmission).
    - Adult new infections declined ~50% from 1997-2020.
    - Children <15 years: ~70% reduction, largely due to ART for preventing mother-to-infant transmission.
    - Estimated 27.5 million people globally on ART as of December 2020.
- **AIDS Deaths (2020)**:
    - Totaled 680,000 (including 99,000 children <15 years).
    - 64% decrease since peak in 2004, coinciding with ART expansion.
    - Estimated 36.3 million persons globally died of AIDS-related illness since pandemic start.
- **Regional Epidemic Characteristics**:
    - Occurred in "waves," with different characteristics based on demographics and timing of HIV introduction.
    - Sub-Saharan Africa likely where it began, particularly devastated.

    - Estimated 1.2 million individuals living with HIV.
    - ~13% unaware of their infection.
- **Care Continuum (2019)**:
    - Only ~57% of HIV-infected people in US navigated continuum from diagnosis to viral suppression.
    - Receipt of medical care: ≥1 test (CD4 or viral load).
    - Retained in care: ≥2 tests (CD4 or VL) ≥3 months apart in 2019.

    - Stalled in recent years: ~34,000-38,000 new infections annually.
- **Geographic and Racial/Ethnic Distribution**:
    - Not evenly distributed across states/regions.
    - Concentrated in urban areas in most of country.
    - Southern US: larger percentages of diagnoses in smaller metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.
    - Disproportionately affected minority populations (urban and rural).
    - 2019 diagnoses: 42% Black/African Americans (13% of US population); 29% Hispanics/Latinos (18% of US population).
- **Perinatal Transmission**:
    - Declined significantly due to universal counseling, voluntary HIV testing of pregnant women, and ART for pregnant women/newborns.
    - 2019: 61 children newly diagnosed, down from ~1750 in 1991.
- **HIV-Related Deaths**:
    - Rate rose steadily through 1980s, peaked in 1995.
    - Fallen fourfold since 1995.
    - Reasons: improved prophylaxis/treatment of opportunistic infections, increased healthcare experience, improved access to care, decreased new infections.
    - Most influential factor: increased use of combination ART.

## Pathophysiology and Pathogenesis

- **Hallmark of HIV Disease**:
    - Profound immunodeficiency from progressive quantitative and qualitative deficiency of helper CD4+ T lymphocytes.
    - Occurs in a setting of aberrant immune activation.
    - CD4 molecule: primary cellular receptor for HIV.
    - Co-receptors (CCR5, CXCR4) needed for efficient binding, fusion, entry.
- **Mechanisms of CD4+ T cell Depletion/Dysfunction**:
    - Direct infection and destruction by HIV.
    - Indirect effects: immune clearance of infected cells.
    - Cell death from aberrant immune activation and inflammation, including caspase 1–mediated pyroptosis of abortively infected tissue CD4+ T cells.
    - Immune exhaustion due to persistent cellular activation leading to dysfunction.
- **Opportunistic Diseases**:
    - Patients with CD4+ T-cell levels below certain thresholds are at high risk.
    - Some AIDS features (KS, neurologic abnormalities) can occur before severe immunologic impairment.
- **Complex Pathogenic Events**:
    - Multifactorial and multiphasic, differ at various disease stages.
    - Understanding typical clinical course of untreated individual is essential.

### Early Events in HIV Infection: Primary Infection and Initial Dissemination of Virus

- **Mucosal Transmission Model (Nonhuman Primates)**:
    - Earliest events (within hours) determine infection establishment or abortion.
    - Mucosal barrier limits HIV access, but virus can cross via Langerhans cells or microscopic rents.
    - Significant mucosal disruptions (e.g., ulcerative genital disease) facilitate viral entry.
- **Targeting CD4+ T Cells**:
    - Virus seeks susceptible targets, primarily CD4+ T cells in mucosa.
    - Spatial dispersion of targets is an obstacle, accounting for low efficiency of sexual transmission.
    - "Partially" resting and activated CD4+ T cells serve as early amplifiers.
        - Resting cells are more abundant.
        - Activated cells support productive infection and generate more virus.
    - Infection established if basic reproductive rate (R0) ≥1.
- **Viral Replication and Dissemination**:
    - Virus replicates in lymphoid cells of mucosa, submucosa, and lymphoreticular tissues.
    - "Eclipse" phase: virus typically undetectable in plasma for days.
    - Days to weeks later: virus produced, disseminates to draining lymph nodes then other lymphoid compartments with dense CD4+ T-cell targets.
    - Burst of high-level plasma viremia becomes detectable.
    - Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is a target, where large numbers of memory CD4+ T cells are infected and depleted by direct viral effects and activation-associated apoptosis.
    - Once replication reaches threshold, infection established throughout lymphoid tissues for life.
- **Bloodstream Entry**:
    - Via infected blood/products (transfusions, contaminated needles, sharp-object injuries, maternal-to-fetal transmission, sexual intercourse with bleeding).
    - Virus likely cleared from circulation to spleen and other lymphoid organs.
    - Primary focal infections begin, followed by wider dissemination.
- **Sexual Transmission and Viral Bottleneck**:
    - Result of single infectious event.
    - Viral genetic bottleneck with selective transmission of certain viruses.
    - HIV envelope glycoprotein characteristics influence transmission.
    - Transmitting viruses ("founder viruses") are typically underrepresented in transmitting partner's viremia.
    - Less-diverged, shorter V1-V2 loop sequences, fewer predicted N-linked glycosylation sites.
    - Almost exclusively R5 strains, usually sensitive to neutralizing antibody.
    - Once replication proceeds in new partner, founder virus diverges, accumulates glycosylation sites, becomes more neutralization resistant.
- **Acute Viremia and Symptoms**:
    - Acute burst of viremia and wide dissemination may cause acute HIV syndrome (~50% of individuals, 2-4 weeks post-infection).
    - Associated with millions of HIV RNA copies/mL plasma, lasting weeks.
    - Acute mononucleosis-like symptoms correlate with high plasma viremia.
    - Most patients develop plasma viremia during primary infection, even if asymptomatic.
    - Initial plasma viremia level does not necessarily determine disease progression rate.
    - **Viral set point** (steady-state plasma viremia after ~1 year) correlates with disease progression rate in untreated patients.
    - High viremia in acute infection linked to higher transmission likelihood (sexual, shared needles, mother-to-child).

### Establishment of Chronic Infection

- **Persistence of Virus Replication**:
    - HIV infection unique: robust immune responses following primary infection do not clear virus.
    - Virus escapes complete immune-mediated clearance, thrives on immune activation, never completely eliminated.
    - Chronic infection develops, persists with varying degrees of continual virus replication in untreated patients for ~10 years median before clinical illness.
    - This chronic, persistent infection is hallmark of HIV disease.
    - Virus replication detectable in untreated patients by molecular assays (plasma HIV RNA).
    - Levels vary (fewer than 50 to >1 million copies/mL plasma).
    - Even in treated patients with suppressed plasma viremia (<20-50 copies/mL), low-level virion production persists.
    - Differs from other infections where host survival leads to virus clearance or microbiologic latency (e.g., HSV).
    - HBV/HCV can have chronicity with persistent replication, but immune system not direct target.
- **Escape from Immune System Control**:
    - HIV evades cellular and humoral immune responses through several mechanisms:
        - **Sustained Replication and Diversity**: High replication rate + mutation/recombination.
        - **CTL Escape**: Selection of mutants escaping CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is critical.
        - **Antibody Ineffectiveness**: High replication + mutations prevent antibody from neutralizing/clearing autologous virus.
        - **Lack of Neutralizing Antibodies**: Humoral immune system does not readily produce classic neutralizing antibodies against HIV envelope until years after infection is established.
        - **Early Viral Escape**: Viral escape from B-cell and CD8+ T-cell responses occurs early, allowing virus to stay ahead of immune responses.
        - **Immune Dysfunction/Exhaustion**: Initially strong immune response becomes qualitatively dysfunctional due to overwhelming immune activation from persistent viral replication.
            - Associated with upregulation of inhibitory receptors (immune-checkpoint receptors) on HIV-specific CD8+ T cells: programmed death (PD) 1, TIGIT, Tim-3, Lag-3.
            - Restricts polyreactivity and proliferative capacity of CD8+ T cells.
        - **HLA Class I Downregulation**: Viral proteins Nef, Tat, Vpu downregulate HLA class I molecules on infected cells, preventing CD8+ CTL recognition/killing.
            - Favors NK cell elimination, but this mechanism not effective.
        - **Sequestration**: Infected cells sequestered in immunologically privileged sites (e.g., CNS).
        - **Low CTL Frequency**: Low frequency of virus-specific CD8+ CTLs in lymphoid tissue germinal centers where HIV replicates.
    - **Antibody Evasion Mechanisms**:
        - Hypervariability in envelope primary sequence.
        - Extensive glycosylation of envelope.
        - Conformational masking of neutralizing epitopes.
        - Virus continually mutates to escape emerging antibody response.
        - Broadly neutralizing antibodies (neutralize wide range of primary isolates _in vitro_) occur in only ~20% of infected individuals, taking 2-3 years of persistent replication to form.
        - By the time formed, ineffective in containing current replicating virus _in patient_.
        - Persistent viremia leads to B cell exhaustion, adding to humoral response defects.
    - **CD4+ T-cell Help Loss**:
        - Essential for humoral and cell-mediated antigen-specific immune responses.
        - HIV preferentially infects activated CD4+ T cells, including HIV-specific ones.
        - Loss has profound negative consequences for immunologic control.
        - 40-70% of memory CD4+ T cells in GALT eliminated during acute infection.
        - Chronic viremia: CD4+ T cells show exhaustion (e.g., upregulation of CTLA-4).
    - **Latently Infected Cells (Reservoir)**:
        - Pool of latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells forms in primary infection.
        - Not recognized or eliminated by CTLs or ART.
        - Allows chronic infection despite potent immune response and viral downregulation.
- **The HIV Reservoir: Obstacles to Eradication**:
    - Exists in virtually all HIV-infected individuals, even those on ART.
    - Latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells carry integrated HIV DNA.
    - Upon activation signal, these cells express HIV transcripts.
    - Small fraction of latently infected cells contain replication-competent virus; overwhelming majority have defective proviruses.
    - Activation of reservoir leads to variable degrees of sustained virus replication.
    - **Preintegration Latency**: HIV enters resting CD4+ T cell, reverse transcription occurs, but proviral DNA fails to integrate without activation signal.
        - May last hours to days.
        - If no activation, proviral DNA loses capacity for productive infection.
        - If activated, replication cycle proceeds.
    - Pool of postintegration latency cells established early in primary infection.
    - Persists despite ART suppression to <50 copies/mL for years.
    - Can give rise to replication-competent virus upon cellular activation _ex vivo_.
    - Modeling suggests many years to host's lifetime needed to eliminate pool.
    - Not documented spontaneously due to long-lived reservoir, continuous replenishment by low-level replication (below detection limits), and proliferation of latently infected cells.
    - Reservoirs exist in lymphoid tissue, peripheral blood, CNS (monocyte/macrophage lineage), and other unidentified locations.
    - "Shock and kill" attempts (activating resting CD4+ T cells to reinitiate viral expression for elimination) have been unsuccessful.
    - Major obstacle to classic "cure".
    - Efforts directed toward ART-free remission via long-acting broadly neutralizing antibodies and immune-enhancing therapeutic agents.
- **Viral Dynamics**:
    - Quantified using mathematical modeling with reverse transcriptase/protease inhibitors.
    - Precipitous decline in plasma viremia (>90% within 2 weeks).
    - **Source of Circulating Virus**:
        - 93-99% from recently infected, rapidly turning over CD4+ T cells.
        - ~1-7% from longer-lived cells (likely monocytes/macrophages).
        - Negligible from latently infected cells.
    - Half-life of circulating virion: ~30-60 min.
    - Half-life of productively infected cells: 1 day.
    - Extremely large amounts (~10^10-10^11 virions) produced and cleared daily.
    - Minimal HIV-1 replication cycle duration _in vivo_: ~2 days.
    - Decrease in plasma viremia with ART correlates with decreased replication in lymph nodes, confirming lymphoid tissue as main replication site/source.
- **Viral Set Point**:
    - Level of steady-state viremia at ~1 year post-acquisition.
    - Important prognostic implications for untreated HIV disease progression.
    - Low set point: slower progression to AIDS.
    - High set point: faster progression to AIDS.
- **Clinical Latency vs. Microbiologic Latency**:
    - Untreated viremic individuals inevitably experience progressive decline in CD4+ T cells.
    - Most patients asymptomatic during this decline (clinical latency).
    - Term "clinical latency" is misleading: progression is generally relentless, with detectable plasma viremia.
    - Should not be confused with microbiologic latency: varying levels of virus replication always occur.
    - Even in rare "elite controllers" (<50 copies/mL without therapy), low-level ongoing virus replication is virtually always present.

### Advanced HIV Disease

- Untreated or inadequately controlled patients: CD4+ T-cell count falls below critical level (<200/µL).
- High susceptibility to opportunistic disease.
- CDC stage 3 (AIDS) definition includes HIV-infected individuals >5 years old with CD4+ T-cell counts <200/µL.
- Patients may have constitutional symptoms or abrupt opportunistic disease.
- CD4+ T cell depletion progressive and unrelenting (counts can drop to 10/µL or zero).
- In countries with accessible ART/prophylaxis: survival dramatically increased.
- Untreated patients progressing to severe immunodeficiency usually succumb to opportunistic infections or neoplasms.

### Long-Term Survivors, Long-Term Nonprogressors, and Elite Controllers

- **Long-Term Survivor**: Any individual surviving for a considerable period.
    - With effective ART, long-term survival is commonplace.
    - HIV-infected 20-year-old on ART can expect to live at least 50 years.
    - Prior to ART, median survival with life-threatening opportunistic infection was 26 weeks.
- **Long-Term Nonprogressor**: Subset of long-term survivors.
    - Infected for long period (≥10 years).
    - Normal CD4+ T-cell counts.
    - Relatively low plasma viremia (undetectable to several thousand copies/mL).
    - Clinically stable for years without ART.
    - ~5-15% of HIV-infected individuals fell into this category.
    - Heterogeneous group, significant proportion eventually progressed and required ART.
- **Elite Controller**: A much smaller subgroup (fraction of 1% of HIV-infected individuals).
    - Extremely low plasma viremia (often undetectable by standard assays).
    - Normal CD4+ T-cell counts.
    - Robust and superior HIV-specific immune response, especially HIV-specific CD8+ CTLs.
    - Overrepresentation of certain HLA class I haplotypes, particularly HLA-B57-01 and HLA-B27-05.
- Other genetic factors also influence virus replication control and disease progression rate.

### Lymphoid Organs and HIV Pathogenesis

- **Major Sites of Infection**:
    - Lymphoid tissues are primary anatomic sites for establishment and propagation of HIV infection.
    - Virus replication mainly occurs in lymphoid tissue, not blood.
    - Plasma viremia levels directly reflect virus production in lymphoid tissue.
- **Lymphadenopathy**:
    - Some patients develop progressive generalized lymphadenopathy early.
    - Others have transient lymphadenopathy.
    - Reflects cellular activation and immune response in lymphoid tissue (follicular or germinal center hyperplasia).
    - Common denominator in virtually all HIV patients, even without detectable lymphadenopathy.
- **Insights from Lymphoid Tissue Studies**:
    - Studies of lymph tissue and peripheral blood (humans, SIV-infected monkeys) provided insights.
    - Original human studies focused on peripheral lymph nodes; recent studies include GALT (earliest burst of replication, marked CD4+ T cell depletion).
    - Techniques: sensitive molecular approaches (HIV DNA/RNA), imaging.
- **Acute Infection in Lymphoid Tissues**:
    - Mucosal transmission: virus replication amplifies from scattered lymphoid cells in gut lamina propria to draining lymph nodes.
    - Leads to high plasma viremia.
    - GALT plays major role in amplification and dissemination to peripheral lymphoid tissues.
    - Profound cellular activation in lymphoid tissues reflected by follicular/germinal center hyperplasia.
    - Copious extracellular virions (infectious and defective) trapped on follicular dendritic cell (FDC) processes in germinal centers.
    - Virions bound to complement components attach to FDCs via complement/Fc receptors.
    - HIV primarily expressed in CD4+ T cells of paracortical area, and to lesser extent, specialized CD4+ T cells in germinal centers.
    - Persistence of trapped virus on FDCs reflects long-lived reservoir and continuous expression in nearby CD4+ T cells.
    - Trapped virus/shed envelope serves as continuous activator of CD4+ T cells, driving further replication.
- **Lymphoid Tissue Architecture and Progression**:
    - Early stages: architecture generally preserved, may be hyperplastic (increased B cells, follicular helper CD4+ T cells (TFH) in germinal centers).
    - Extracellular virions attached to FDC processes.
    - FDC functions (antigen presentation, CXCL13 secretion) and TFH factors contribute to B-cell memory.
    - However, persistent cellular activation and shift to proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6) induce viral replication and diminish immune response effectiveness.
    - CD4+ TFH cells are highly susceptible to infection and may be important HIV reservoir component.
    - Normal physiologic immune function can have deleterious consequences in HIV infection.
    - Disease progression: lymphoid tissue architecture disruption begins.
        - Destruction of fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) and FDC networks.
        - Mechanisms unclear, but associated with collagen deposition (fibrosis) and shift in cytokine expression (decreases in IL-7, lymphotoxin-α; increased TGF-β).
    - Advanced stage: complete disruption of lymphoid tissue architecture, dissolution of FRC/FDC networks ("burnt out" lymph nodes).
    - Compounds immunodeficiency, contributing to inability to control HIV replication and inadequate immune responses to opportunistic pathogens/vaccination.
    - Nonhuman primate/human GALT studies: basal cellular activation + virus-mediated activation leads to rapid infection/elimination of ~50-90% of gut CD4+ T cells.

### The Role of Immune Activation and Inflammation in HIV Pathogenesis

- **Essential vs. Aberrant Activation**:
    - Immune activation/inflammation are essential for immune response to foreign antigen.
    - Aberrant in HIV, playing critical role in HIV disease and other chronic conditions.
- **Contribution of Aberrant Immune Activation/Inflammation**:
    1. HIV replication.
    2. Induction of immune dysfunction.
    3. Increased incidence of chronic conditions (e.g., premature cardiovascular disease).
- **Induction of HIV Replication by Aberrant Immune Activation**:
    - Normal immune system is homeostatic, returns to quiescence after antigen clearance.
    - Not the case in HIV: persistent virus replication leads to persistent immune activation.
    - HIV replicates most efficiently in activated CD4+ T cells.
    - Chronic activation provides cell substrates for persistent replication.
    - Even in ART-treated patients with suppressed viremia, low detectable virus replication drives low-level persistent immune activation.
    - Immune activation may result from RNA transcription of integrated defective proviruses.
    - Quiescent CD4+ T cells can be infected (inefficiently), but reverse transcription, integration, spread much more efficient in activated cells.
    - Cellular activation induces virus expression in latently infected cells.
    - Immune activation/inflammation provides "engine" for HIV replication.
    - Exogenous factors (microbes associated with heightened activation) can enhance HIV replication.
- **Co-infection Effects**:
    - Viruses (HSV-1/2, CMV, HHV-6, EBV, HBV, HCV, adenovirus, HTLV-1) shown to upregulate HIV expression.
    - Nematode infestation: heightened immune activation, facilitates HIV replication; deworming reduced plasma viremia.
    - Malaria and Tuberculosis (TB): increase HIV viral load in dually infected individuals.
        - TB: Most common opportunistic infection globally in HIV-infected.
            - HIV patients more likely to develop active TB and reactivate latent TB.
            - Active TB accelerates HIV course; elevated plasma viremia in active TB (untreated ART).
            - Viremia declines after successful TB treatment.
        - Malaria (_Plasmodium falciparum_): acute infection increases viral load, reversed by effective treatment.
- **Microbial Translocation and Persistent Immune Activation**:
    - Mechanism: disruption of mucosal barrier in gut due to HIV replication in submucosal lymphoid tissue.
    - Increases bacterial products (esp. lipopolysaccharide - LPS) translocating from bowel lumen to circulation.
    - Leads to persistent systemic immune activation and inflammation, even after ART suppresses viral load.
    - Other factors: depletion of IL-17–producing T cells in GALT (defense against extracellular bacteria/fungi), alterations in gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.
- **Persistent Immune Activation and Inflammation Induce Immune Dysfunction**:
    - Reflected by:
        - Hyperactivation of B cells (hypergammaglobulinemia).
        - Increased lymphocyte turnover.
        - Activation of monocytes.
        - Expression of activation markers/immune checkpoint receptors on CD4+/CD8+ T cells.
        - Increased activation-associated cellular apoptosis and pyroptosis.
        - Lymph node hyperplasia (chronic phase, before progression).
        - Increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-6, type I interferons).
        - Elevated levels of: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, CXCL10, D-dimer, neopterin, β2-microglobulin, soluble (s) CD14, sTNFR, sCD27, sCD163, sCD40L.
        - Autoimmune phenomena.
    - HIV envelope proteins can interact with cellular receptors (CD4, chemokine receptors) to deliver activation signals, leading to calcium flux, protein phosphorylation, immune dysfunction, apoptosis, pyroptosis.
    - Chronic antigen exposure may lead to inability to sustain adequate immune response ("functional exhaustion").
        - Mediated by upregulation of inhibitory receptors on HIV-specific T cells: PD-1, LAG-3, Tim-3 (shared by CD4+/CD8+ T cells), CTLA-4 (CD4+), 2B4, CD160 (CD8+).
    - Compromised response to non-HIV antigens if bystander cells chronically activated.
    - Normal immunoregulatory mechanisms (CD4+, FoxP3+, CD25+ regulatory T cells - T-regs) may be dysfunctional or depleted in advanced disease.
        - Inhibitory receptor LAG-3 may inhibit T-reg proliferation.
- **Apoptosis**:
    - Programmed cell death, normal for cell elimination.
    - Aberrant cellular activation in HIV correlated with heightened apoptosis.
    - HIV triggers activation-induced cell death via upregulation of death receptors (Fas/CD95, TNFR1, TRAIL receptors 1/2) and their ligands (FasL, TNF, TRAIL).
    - HIV-induced stress/homeostasis alterations trigger intrinsic apoptosis (downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins like Bcl-2).
    - Other mechanisms: autophagy, necrosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis.
    - Pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death via caspase 1, IL-1β, IL-18) linked to bystander effect on CD4+ T cell depletion.
        - Generates inflammasomes, activated by LPS.
    - Viral gene products (Env, Tat, Vpr) associated with enhanced apoptosis susceptibility; Nef has antiapoptotic properties.
    - Apoptosis intensity correlates with general immune system activation, not disease stage or viral burden.
    - Elevated in HIV, seen in "bystander" cells (CD8+ T cells, B cells) and uninfected CD4+ T cells.
    - Bystander apoptosis contributes to general immunologic abnormalities.
- **Medical Conditions Associated with Persistent Immune Activation and Inflammation**:
    - Previously unrecognized complications emerging as HIV survival increases.
    - Can appear even after years of ART-induced viral control.
    - Include: bone fragility, certain cancers, diabetes, kidney and liver disease, neurocognitive dysfunction.
    - Overall picture of accelerated aging.
- **Autoimmune Phenomena**:
    - Commonly observed in HIV-infected individuals.
    - Reflect chronic immune activation and B/T cell dysregulation.
    - Usually occur without overt autoimmune disease, but clinical manifestations described.
    - Include antibodies against autoantigens (lymphocytes, other cells), proteins from dying cells.
    - Antiplatelet and anti-erythrocyte antibodies (clinical relevance in thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia).
    - Antibodies to nuclear/cytoplasmic components, cardiolipin/phospholipids, surface receptors (CD4), serum proteins reported.
    - Less frequent in ART era.
    - Molecular mimicry (opportunistic pathogens or HIV itself) is a trigger/cofactor.
    - Antibodies against HIV envelope (especially gp41) cross-react with host proteins (e.g., MPER of gp41 reacts with phospholipids, cardiolipin).
    - Polyreactive HIV-specific antibodies may be beneficial.
    - **Increased/Exacerbated Autoimmune Diseases**:
        - Psoriasis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Graves’ disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis.
        - Most described pre-ART, decreased with ART.
    - **Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)**:
        - Increasingly observed with ART availability, especially in patients with low CD4+ T-cell counts.
        - Autoimmune-like phenomenon.
        - Paradoxical clinical deterioration, usually compartmentalized to organ system.
        - Associated with viral load decrease and partial immune competence recovery (increased CD4+ T-cells).
        - Immunopathogenesis related to increased immune response against residual microbial antigens.
        - Most common with underlying mycobacterial (_M. tuberculosis_, MAC), fungal (cryptococcal), and viral (CMV, HHV) infections.

### Characteristics of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)

|Category|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Paradoxical IRIS**|Worsening of existing, untreated, or partially treated opportunistic infections or exacerbations of pre-existing autoimmune conditions after ART initiation.|
|**Unmasking IRIS**|Development of new autoimmune conditions or previously undiagnosed opportunistic infections/neoplasms following ART initiation.|
|**Incidence**|10–30% of patients following ART initiation, depending on clinical setting. Most common in patients starting ART with CD4+ T-cell counts <50 cells/µL who have precipitous HIV RNA drop.|
|**Onset**|Signs and symptoms may appear anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 years after ART initiation.|
|**Manifestations**|Localized lymphadenitis, prolonged fever, pulmonary infiltrates, hepatitis, increased intracranial pressure, uveitis, sarcoidosis, Graves’ disease.|
|**Course**|Can be protracted; severe cases can be fatal.|
|**Mechanism**|Phenomenon similar to type IV hypersensitivity reactions, reflecting immediate improvements in immune function as HIV RNA drops and immunosuppressive effects are controlled. Related to increased immune response against residual antigens.|
|**Management**|In severe cases, immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids) may be required to blunt inflammatory component while specific antimicrobial therapy takes effect.|
|**Commonly Associated Infections**|Mycobacterial (_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, _M. avium complex_), fungal (cryptococcal), viral (CMV, HHV) infections.|
|**Specific Clinical Contexts**|May cause subacute encephalitis weeks/months after ART initiation, particularly in patients with low CD4+ T-cell counts, due to recovery of CD4+ T cells causing lymphocyte response to CNS HIV reservoir. Worsening of PML with ART.|

### Cytokines and Other Soluble Factors in HIV Pathogenesis

- **Immunoregulatory Network**:
    - Immune system regulated by complex network of pleiotropic and redundant cytokines.
    - Expressed continuously, increasing with antigenic challenge.
    - Play major roles in early and chronic phases of HIV infection.
- **Acute Phase**:
    - Potent proinflammatory "cytokine storm" induced.
    - Induced cytokines/chemokines: Type I interferon IFN-α, IL-15, CXCL10.
    - Followed by IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α.
    - Delayed peak of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.
    - Soluble innate immunity factors: neopterin, β-microglobulin.
    - Many persist during chronic infection, maintaining high immune activation (unlike self-resolving infections).
- **Paradoxical Effects**:
    - Early-expressed cytokines/factors (e.g., IFN-α) intended to contain viral replication.
    - Paradoxically, most are potent inducers of HIV expression/replication because they induce immune activation, increasing target cells.
    - IFN-α induces IFN-associated genes, activating immune system, altering CD4+ T cell homeostasis, influencing virus variants.
- **Chronic Phase**:
    - Elevated cytokines: IFN-γ, RANTES (CCL5), MIP-1β (CCL4), IL-18.
    - **Prognostic Markers**:
        - IP-10: predictive of disease progression.
        - Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, sCD14 (monocyte/macrophage activation marker), D-dimer (coagulation marker): associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, even on ART.
        - IL-18: role in HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome.
    - Elevated TNF-α and IL-6 in plasma and CSF.
    - Increased TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6 expression in lymph nodes before disease progression; shift to TGF-β in advanced disease.
- **Inhibitory Factors**:
    - CC-chemokines RANTES (CCL5), MIP-1α (CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4): inhibit infection and spread of R5 HIV-1 strains.
    - Stromal cell–derived factor (SDF) 1: inhibits infection and spread of X4 strains.
    - Mechanisms: blocking binding to co-receptors CCR5 (for R5) and CXCR4 (for X4).
    - Soluble CD8 antiviral factor (CAF): suppresses HIV replication, independent of co-receptor usage.

### Lymphocyte Turnover in HIV Infection

- **Increased Turnover**:
    - Profound increase in lymphocyte turnover (CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes).
    - Seen in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue.
    - Immediately reduced with effective ART.
    - Tight correlation between lymphocyte turnover degree and plasma viremia.
- **Consequences**:
    - Shift in cells from quiescent to higher turnover pool.
    - Higher turnover rate likely leads to higher cell death rate.
    - More rapid decline in CD4+ vs. CD8+ T cells possibly linked to altered inflammatory/homeostatic cytokines causing increased activation-induced death without replenishment.

### Proposed Mechanisms of CD4+ T-Cell Dysfunction and Depletion

|Mechanism|Description|
|:--|:--|
|Direct viral cytopathic effects|HIV infection directly damages and kills CD4+ T cells.|
|Syncytia formation|Infected cells fuse with uninfected CD4+ cells, forming multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) that then die.|
|Programmed cell death (apoptosis/pyroptosis)|Aberrant immune activation and HIV viral proteins trigger accelerated death of both infected and "bystander" uninfected CD4+ T cells.|
|Immune exhaustion|Chronic immune activation and persistent viral replication lead to functional impairment and deletion of virus-specific and bystander T cells, reducing their ability to proliferate and perform effector functions.|
|Immune-mediated killing|CD8+ CTLs and NK cells may kill HIV-infected cells, contributing to their depletion.|
|Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)|Antibodies bind to HIV antigens on infected cells or free gp120 on uninfected cells, marking them for destruction by NK cells.|
|Altered thymic output|HIV infection may impair the thymus, reducing the production of new CD4+ T cells needed for replenishment.|
|Destruction of lymphoid tissue architecture|Disruption of fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) and follicular dendritic cell (FDC) networks in lymph nodes impairs immune cell regeneration and function.|
|Microbial translocation|Disruption of the gut mucosal barrier allows bacterial products (e.g., LPS) to enter circulation, causing chronic systemic immune activation and inflammation, which promotes CD4+ T cell activation, infection, and death.|
|Homeostatic dysregulation|Imbalance of cytokines (e.g., elevated proinflammatory cytokines, reduced IL-7 utilization) affects CD4+ T cell survival and proliferation.|
|Direct effects of viral proteins|Soluble HIV proteins (e.g., gp120, Tat, Nef, Vpr) can bind to uninfected cells, induce signaling abnormalities, anergy, or apoptosis, or disrupt cellular homeostasis, leading to dysfunction or death without direct infection.|

### The Role of Viral Receptors and Co-receptors in HIV Pathogenesis

- **CCR5 and CXCR4**:
    - Two major co-receptors used by HIV-1 with CD4 for binding, fusion, and entry.
    - Also receptors for certain endogenous chemokines.
    - **R5 viruses**: utilize CCR5.
    - **X4 viruses**: utilize CXCR4.
    - **R5X4 viruses**: dual tropic, utilize both.
- **Blocking Entry**:
    - Natural chemokine ligands for co-receptors can block HIV entry.
    - CC-chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β) for CCR5 block R5 viruses.
    - SDF-1 for CXCR4 blocks X4 viruses.
    - Mechanism: steric inhibition of binding, not dependent on signal transduction.
- **Tropism and Disease Progression**:
    - Transmitting virus almost invariably an R5 virus, predominates early.
    - Deep sequencing detects more X4 variants in early disease than previously reported.
    - Untreated or therapeutic failure: transition to predominantly X4 virus in ~half of subtype B infected individuals.
        - Transition often preceded by dual R5X4 strains.
        - X4 variant detection associated with rapid CD4+ T-cell decline, increased plasma viremia, disease progression.
    - Other half progress with R5 virus predominance.
    - Non-subtype B clades less rarely switch from CCR5 to CXCR4 tropism.
- **Mechanism of Tropism**:
    - Relates to HIV envelope's (including V3 loop of gp120) ability to interact with CCR5 or CXCR4.
    - Gp120 binding to CD4 induces conformational change, increasing affinity for co-receptor.
    - R5 viruses more efficient in infecting monocytes/macrophages and microglial cells in brain.
- **The Integrin α4β7**:
    - Accessory receptor for HIV, not essential for infection.
    - Likely plays important role in HIV transmission at mucosal surfaces (genital tract, gut) and disease pathogenesis.
    - Gut homing receptor for peripheral T cells.
    - Activated form binds specific tripeptide in V2 loop of gp120.
    - Results in rapid activation of leukocyte function–associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), central integrin in virologic synapses, facilitating cell-to-cell spread.
    - α4β7high CD4+ T cells more susceptible to productive infection (enriched with metabolically active, CCR5high CD4+ T cells).
    - Present in mucosal surfaces of gut and genital tract.
    - Transmitted virus during sexual exposure binds much more efficiently to α4β7 than mutated, diversified virus.

### Cellular Targets of HIV

- **Primary Targets**: CD4+ T lymphocytes.
- **Lesser Targets**: CD4+ cells of myeloid lineage.
- **Only Productively Infected Cells**: CD4+ T lymphocytes and myeloid lineage CD4+ cells.
- **Dendritic Cells (DCs)**:
    - Circulating DCs express low CD4, but high SAMHD1 (restriction factor) limits replication by depleting dNTPs and degrading viral RNA.
    - Epidermal Langerhans cells express CD4, infected _in vivo_, but restrict replication via langerin.
    - More likely to bind and transfer virus to activated CD4+ T cells than be productively infected (also FDCs, B cells).
- **Thymic Precursor Cells**:
    - Assumed CD3/CD4/CD8 negative, but express low CD4.
    - Can be infected _in vitro_.
    - Human thymic epithelial cells transplanted into immunodeficient mice can be infected by direct thymus inoculation.
    - Possible their infection/depletion contributes to impaired CD4+ T-cell pool reconstitution in some ART-treated individuals.
- **CD34+ Monocyte Precursor Cells**:
    - Infected _in vivo_ in advanced HIV disease patients.
    - Likely express low CD4. Clinical relevance unclear.

### Qualitative and Quantitative Abnormalities of Mononuclear Cells

- **CD4+ T Cells**:
    - **Primary Immunopathogenic Lesion**: involve CD4+ T cells.
    - **Abnormalities**: broad range of quantitative and qualitative defects.
    - Impacts virtually every limb of immune system due to critical dependence on inducer/helper function of CD4+ T cells.
    - Advanced disease: most defects explained by quantitative depletion.
    - Early infection: T-cell dysfunction demonstrated even with low-normal CD4+ T-cell count.
    - Spectrum of dysfunctions increases with disease progression, reflecting CD4+ T-cell functional heterogeneity (especially in lymphoid tissues).
    - **Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (GALT)**:
        - One of first sites of intense HIV replication.
        - CD4+ TH17 cells reside here: important for defense against extracellular pathogens in intestinal mucosa, maintain gut epithelium integrity.
        - Depleted by direct/indirect viral effects, causing loss of gut homeostasis/integrity and shift to TH1 phenotype.
        - Normalization of CD4+ T cells in GALT incomplete even after years of ART.
    - **Follicular Helper CD4+ T cells (TFH)**:
        - HIV perturbs this subset in lymph nodes.
        - Derived from naïve CD4+ T cells or other TH precursors, migrate to B-cell follicles for germinal center reactions.
        - Provide help to antigen-specific B cells via cell-cell interactions and cytokine secretion (esp. IL-21).
        - HIV-infected individuals with broadly neutralizing antibodies have higher frequencies of memory TFH CD4+ T cells.
        - Highly susceptible to HIV infection.
        - Numbers increased in lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals, especially viremic ones.
        - Unclear if increase is beneficial to B cells, likely detrimental to humoral immune response quality against HIV.
    - **Central Memory Cells**: Defects are critical component of HIV immunopathogenesis.
    - **Antigen-Specific CD4+ T Cells**: Progressive loss has implications for HIV infection control.
    - **T-cell Function Abnormalities**:
        - Correlation between maintenance of HIV-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferative responses and improved infection control.
        - Loss of polyfunctional HIV-specific CD4+ T cells (especially IL-2 producers) early in disease.
        - IFN-producing CD4+ T cells maintained longer, do not correlate with HIV viremia control.
        - Impaired IL-2 receptor expression, defective IL-2 production.
        - Reduced IL-7 receptor (CD127) expression.
        - Decreased proportion of CD4+ T cells expressing CD28 (co-stimulatory molecule, also depleted with aging).
            - Cells lacking CD28 expression do not respond normally to activation signals, may express terminal activation markers (HLA-DR, CD38, CD45RO).
    - **T regulatory cells (T-regs)**:
        - Subset of CD4+ T cells that may damp aberrant immune activation.
        - Presence correlates with lower viral loads, higher CD4+/CD8+ T-cell ratios.
        - Loss of T-reg capability with advanced disease detrimental to virus replication control.
    - **Immunodeficiency Explanation**:
        - Difficult to explain solely by direct infection/quantitative depletion, especially early in disease.
        - CD4+ T-cell dysfunction likely from direct infection and indirect effects on "innocent bystander cells".
            - Soluble viral proteins (gp120) bind to CD4 on uninfected T cells/monocytes.
            - Virus/viral proteins bind to DCs or FDCs.
            - HIV-specific antibody recognizes bound molecules, potentially causing ADCC elimination.
        - Intracellular signals from gp120 through CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4 linked to anergy, apoptosis, cell trafficking abnormalities.
        - Molecular mechanisms: dysregulation of T-cell receptor–phosphoinositide pathway, p56lck activation, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, activation of MAP kinase/ras signaling, downregulation of CD40 ligand/CD80.
    - **CD4+ T-cell Pool Regeneration Failure**:
        - Inexorable decline due to inability to regenerate rapidly turning over pool to compensate for HIV-mediated and natural attrition.
        - Degree/duration of CD4+ T cell decline at ART initiation predicts restoration.
        - Prolonged low CD4+ T-cell count pre-ART leads to incomplete reconstitution.
        - Mechanisms: destruction of lymphoid precursor cells (thymic/bone marrow progenitors), gradual disruption of lymphoid tissue architecture/microenvironment.
    - **IL-7 Levels**:
        - Increased serum IL-7 levels in advanced CD4+ T lymphopenia.
        - Initially thought to be homeostatic response; now suggested to be result of reduced IL-7 utilization due to loss of cells expressing IL-7 receptor (CD127).
- **CD8+ T Cells**:
    - **CD8+ T lymphocytosis**: generally associated with high HIV plasma viremia.
        - Reflects immune response to virus and dysregulated homeostasis from generalized immune activation.
    - Late stages: significant reduction in CD8+ T cells despite high viremia.
    - **HIV-specific CD8+ CTLs**:
        - Identified weeks into HIV infection, prior to plasma virus appearance.
        - Emergence often coincides with plasma viremia decrease.
        - Exert selective pressure on circulating viruses, suggesting role in control.
        - Lytic destruction of target cells bearing autologous MHC class I presenting HIV antigens.
        - Two types of CTL activity _in vitro_:
            - Spontaneous CTL activity: direct lysis without prior _in vitro_ stimulation.
            - Precursor frequency of CTLs (CTLp): demonstrated by stimulation with mitogen (phytohemagglutinin, anti-CD3 antibody).
    - **Cytokine-Producing CD8+ T cells**:
        - Can be induced by HIV antigens to express IFN-γ, IL-2, MIP-1β, TNF-α.
        - Unclear if same effector pools as cytotoxic cells.
        - Driven to _in vivo_ expansion by HIV antigen.
        - Direct correlation between IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels.
        - Usually unable to effectively control infection, except in elite nonprogressors.
            - Elite nonprogressors: substantial _in vitro_ proliferation to HIV antigens, express perforin and granzyme.
    - **Functional Decline**:
        - Disease progression: functional capability gradually decreases due to persistent infection.
        - Functional exhaustion via upregulation of inhibitory receptors: PD-1, TIGIT, LAG-3, TIM-3.
        - Systemic effects: abnormal phenotype (HLA-DR+/CD38+ co-expression, absence of IL-2 receptor (CD25), reduced IL-7 receptor (CD127)).
        - Increased CD8+ T cells lacking CD28 expression, skewed expansion of less differentiated subset.
        - Diminished polyfunctionality, distinguishing progressors from elite controllers.
        - Elite controllers maintain high proliferative capacity, increased perforin expression, effective elimination of infected targets.
    - **Prognostic Significance**:
        - CD8+ T cell phenotype may be prognostic.
        - HLA-DR+/CD38– phenotype post-seroconversion: CD4+ T-cell count stabilization.
        - HLA-DR+/CD38+ phenotype: more aggressive course, poorer prognosis.
    - **Other CTL Defects**: Functional defects in other MHC-restricted CTLs (e.g., against influenza, CMV).
    - **Soluble Factors**: CD8+ T cells secrete factors inhibiting HIV replication: RANTES (CCL5), MIP-1α (CCL3), MIP-1β (CCL4), and potentially others.
    - Compounded by CD4+ T cell loss/dysfunction, as CD8+ function depends on CD4+ signals.
- **B Cells**:
    - **Predominant Defect**: Aberrant cellular activation.
        - Increased propensity to terminal differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion.
        - Increased expression of activation markers and exhaustion inhibitory receptors.
        - Decreased capacity for cell signaling and proliferative response _ex vivo_.
        - Enhanced spontaneous immunoglobulin secretion _in vitro_ (reflects highly differentiated state _in vivo_).
    - **EBV-related B-cell lymphomas**: Increased incidence, likely due to defective T-cell immune surveillance and increased B-cell turnover.
    - Untransformed B cells cannot be infected by HIV, but HIV/products can activate B cells directly.
    - B cells from viremic patients bind virions via CD21 complement receptor.
    - _In vivo_ activation by replication-competent/defective virus accounts for activated phenotype.
    - **Subpopulation Changes**:
        - Attrition of resting memory B cells.
        - Replacement with aberrant memory and differentiated B-cell subpopulations (reduced CD21, increased activation markers/inhibitory receptors).
        - Activated/differentiated B cells secrete more immunoglobulins, increased Fas-mediated apoptosis.
        - More advanced disease: immature B cells appear with CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia.
    - **Humoral Immunity Perturbation**: Cognate B-cell–CD4+ T-cell interactions in lymphoid tissues perturbed, especially with persistent viremia.
    - **Clinical Manifestations**:
        - Hypergammaglobulinemia.
        - Circulating immune complexes bind B cells, restricting response to stimulation.
        - Poor response to primary/secondary immunizations with protein/polysaccharide antigens.
        - Memory B-cell defect (e.g., with influenza vaccine), particularly with high HIV viremia.
        - Responses to HIV/non-HIV antigens enriched in abnormal B cell subsets (prone to apoptosis or functional exhaustion).
        - Contribute to inadequate humoral response, decreased vaccination response, increased bacterial infections in advanced HIV.
        - Contribute to inadequacy of host defenses against bacterial infections in HIV-infected children.
    - **Absolute B cell Count**: May be depressed due to increased activation-induced apoptosis or redistribution to lymphoid tissue.
- **Monocytes/Macrophages**:
    - **Numbers**: Generally normal in circulating monocytes.
    - **Activation**: Evidence of increased activation within lineage.
        - Increased sCD14 and other biomarkers are indirect markers of monocyte activation _in vivo_.
        - sCD14 levels can remain elevated despite viral suppression by ART, indicating residual immune activation/inflammation.
    - **Abnormalities**: Many related to aberrant _in vivo_ immune activation.
        - Increased LPS in sera (due to translocation across gut mucosal barrier).
            - LPS is inflammatory, binds to macrophages via CD14/Toll-like receptors, causing activation.
        - Expansion of monocytes expressing intermediate/non-classical CD16 and activation markers (HLA-DR) and stimulation (CD40, CD86), especially in viremic individuals.
        - Activated monocytes secrete inflammatory cytokines/chemokines: CXCL10, IL-1β, IL-6.
    - **Infection**: Express CD4/co-receptors, potential targets.
        - _In vivo_ infection of circulating monocytes difficult to demonstrate.
        - Tissue macrophages and macrophage-lineage cells in brain (infiltrating macrophages, microglial cells) and lung (pulmonary alveolar macrophages) easily demonstrable.
        - Tissue macrophages: important source of HIV during inflammatory response, persistent reservoirs, obstacle to eradication.
- **Dendritic and Langerhans Cells**:
    - **Infection**: Not productively infected with HIV, likely due to host restriction factors (APOBEC3G, SAMHD1).
    - **Role in Initiation**: Important in initiating HIV infection via binding to cell-surface C-type lectin receptors (DC-SIGN, langerin).
        - Langerin: host barrier, traffics HIV to acidic compartments for degradation.
        - DC-SIGN: retains HIV in early endosomal compartments, allows efficient presentation of intact virus to CD4+ T-cell targets.
        - Infected CD4+ T cells + DCs complexes provide optimal microenvironment for virus replication.
    - **pDCs**: Secrete large amounts of IFN-α in response to viral infections, important in innate sensing of HIV early.
    - **Numbers**: Circulating pDCs and mDCs decreased in HIV infection (mechanisms unclear), but increased lymphoid tissue recruitment of DCs with lymphoid hyperplasia/inflammation.
    - **mDCs**: Involved in initiating adaptive immunity in draining lymph nodes (present antigen, secrete IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 to activate other immune cells), though these functions are perturbed in HIV.
- **Natural Killer Cells and Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILCs)**:
    - **NK Cells**: Prototypical ILC member, provide tissue homeostasis/immunosurveillance against virus-infected cells, tumor cells, allogeneic cells.
    - **Infection**: No convincing data that HIV productively infects NK cells _in vivo_.
    - **Functional Abnormalities**: Observed throughout HIV disease, severity increases with progression.
    - **Early HIV Infection**: Increased NK cell activation, maintained IFN-γ secretion capacity, but reduced cytotoxic function due to altered maturation.
    - **Chronic HIV Infection**: Both NK cell cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion impaired.
    - **HLA Downregulation**: HIV infection of target cells downregulates HLA-A and B (not HLA-C/D), possibly explaining NK cells' inability to kill HIV-infected target cells.
    - **"Anergic" NK Subset Expansion**: Impairments linked to expansion of "anergic" CD56–/CD16+ NK cell subset.
        - Increased expression of inhibitory NK cell receptors (iNKRs).
        - Substantial decrease in expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs).
        - Markedly impaired lytic activity.
        - Overrepresentation of this subset may explain NK function defects, begins in primary infection.
    - **Impact of Receptors**: Relative expression of iNKRs/NCRs and their ligands (HLA class I) impacts antiviral functions (direct killing, ADCC).
    - **Genetic Factors**: Polymorphisms in iNKR and NCR alleles linked to HIV-1 disease outcomes.
        - Early HIV control may be mediated by cytotoxic NK cell-mediated responses.
    - **Soluble Factors**: NK cells sources of HIV-inhibitory soluble factors (CC-chemokines: MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES).
    - Inflammatory cytokines and GALT alterations disrupt NK cells and other ILCs.

### Genetic Factors in HIV-1 and AIDS Pathogenesis

- **Host Gene Polymorphisms**:
    - Identified by candidate gene approaches and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
    - Contribute to inter-individual variation in:
        1. Risk of acquiring HIV.
        2. Steady-state HIV levels (virologic set point).
        3. Rate of untreated HIV progression to AIDS (CD4+ T-cell count <200 cells/mm3 and/or AIDS-defining illnesses).
        4. Level of immune reconstitution (e.g., CD4+ cell counts) and non-AIDS-associated disease risk after ART.
        5. Adverse reactions to antiretroviral agents.
    - Identification advanced understanding of genes influencing HIV-AIDS pathogenesis and ART-associated immune reconstitution.
- **Key Chromosomal Regions**:
    - **Chromosome 3**: includes CCR5 gene (HIV co-receptor).
    - **Chromosome 6**: major histocompatibility locus (MHC).

# Human Immunodeficiency Virus Disease: AIDS and Related Disorders

## Definition

- Current CDC classification based on:
    - Clinical conditions associated with HIV infection.
    - CD4+ T lymphocyte count level.
- Confirmed HIV case stages: 0, 1, 2, 3, or unknown (U).
    - **Stage 0**: Negative HIV test within 6 months of first HIV diagnosis; remains 0 until 6 months post-diagnosis.
    - **Stage 3 (Advanced HIV disease / AIDS)**:
        - Diagnosed if one or more specific opportunistic illnesses detected (see Table 202-1).
        - Otherwise determined by CD4+ T lymphocyte test results and immunologic criteria (see Table 202-2).
    - **Stage U**: If criteria not applicable (e.g., missing CD4+ T lymphocyte test results).
- Definition and staging criteria are:
    - Complex and comprehensive.
    - Established for surveillance purposes, not practical patient care.
    - Clinicians should view HIV disease as a spectrum: primary infection (with/without acute syndrome), relatively | | Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) | | | Recurrent bacterial pneumonia | | | Tuberculosis (TB) | | | Other mycobacterial infections (e.g., MAC) | | | Other fungal infections (e.g., Cryptococcosis, Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Penicilliosis) | | | Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection | | | _Toxoplasma gondii_ encephalitis | | | Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)| | | Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) | | | HIV-associated dementia (HAD) | | | Generalized wasting | | | Invasive cervical carcinoma | | | Reactivation American trypanosomiasis (Chagas’ disease) | | | Disseminated _Penicillium marneffei_ infection | |

## Etiologic Agent

- **Classification**:
    - **HIV** is the etiologic agent of AIDS.
    - Belongs to the family **Retroviridae**, subfamily **lentiviruses**.
    - Nononcogenic lentiviruses cause disease in other animal species (sheep, horses, goats, cattle, cats, monkeys).
- **Human Retroviruses**:
    - Four known to cause human disease:
        - Human T lymphotropic viruses (HT5].
    - **AIDS pandemic primarily caused by HIV-1 M group viruses**.
    - Group O and HIV-2 viruses have caused more localized epidemics.
    - Reported infections with group N and P viruses are rare and confined almost entirely to residents/travelers from Cameroon.
- **HIV-2**:
    - First identified in 1986 in West African patients.
    - Originally confined to West Africa, but cases traced globally.
    - Currently defined groups: A through H.
    - Derived from sooty mangabeys.
- **Morphology**:
    - HIV virion is an **icosahedral structure**.
    - Contains numerous external spikes formed by two major envelope proteins: **external gp120** and **transmembrane gp41**.
    - The HIV envelope exists as a **trimeric heterodimer**.
    - Virion buds from the surface of the infected cell, incorporating host cellular proteins into its lipid bilayer.
    - **HIV of **gp120 protein** to the **CD4 molecule** on the host cell surface.
    - The **CD4 molecule** (55-kDa protein) is found predominantly on helper T lymphocytes.
    - After CD4 binding, gp120 undergoes a conformational change, facilitating binding to one of two major co-receptors: **CCR5** or **CXCR4**.
    - Both co-receptors belong to the family of seven-transmembrane-domain G protein–coupled cellular receptors.
    - Co-receptor usage is an important determinant of the virus's cellular tropism.
    - **Cell-to-cell spread** is facilitated by accessory molecules like the C-type lectin receptor **DC-SIGN** (on dendritic cells), which binds to gp120 and allows virus transfer to CD4+ T cells.
    - Following binding and conformational change, **fusion with the host cell membrane** occurs via the newly exposed **gp41 molecule**, which penetrates the target cell's plasma membrane and coils to bring the virion and target cell together.
- **Post-Fusion Events**:
    - **Uncoating** of the capsid protein shell is initiated.
    - Leads to formation of the **preintegration complex**: viral RNA, enzymes, and accessory proteins, surrounded by capsid and matrix proteins.
    - These post-fusion components form the **HIV replication complex**, with the outer capsid shell supporting reverse transcription.
    - As the preintegration complex traverses the cytoplasm to the nucleus, **viral reverse transcriptase** catalyzes the reverse transcription of genomic RNA into **double-stranded HIV proviral DNA**.
- **Host Restriction Factors (Cellular Antiviral Mechanisms)**:
    - **Cytoplasmic tripartite motif-containing protein 5-α (TRIM5-α)**: Interacts with retroviral capsids, causing premature disassembly and inducing innate immune responses.
    - **Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme (APOBEC3) family**: Inhibits virus infection after entry, before entering the nucleus.
        - APOBEC3 proteins are incorporated into virions and released into the cytoplasm of newly infected cells. 0].
- **Integration and Gene Expression**:
    - Upon **cellular activation**, viral DNA accesses the nuclear pore and is transferred to the nucleus.
    - Integrated into host cell chromosomes through the action of the virally encoded enzyme **integrase**.
    - HIV proviral DNA integrates preferentially in regions of active transcription and regional hotspots.
    - This provirus can remain transcriptionally inactive (latent) or manifest varying levels of gene expression up to active transcription and virus production, depending on the infected cell's metabolic state.
- **Role of Cellular Activation**:
    - Plays an important role in the replication cycle and is critical to pathogenesis.
    - Incompletely reverse-transcribed DNA intermediates are labile in quiescent cells and do not integrate efficiently unless cellular activation occurs shortly after infection.
    - Some degree of host cell activation is required for initiating transcription of integrated proviral DNA into genomic RNA or mRNA.
    - Activation of HIV expression from the latent state depends on interaction of various cellular and viral factors.
- *_Protein Processing_ HIV accessory protein **Vpu** counteracts tetherin's effect through direct interactions.
    - During or soon after budding, the virally encoded **protease** catalyzes the cleavage of the gag-pol precursor to yield the mature virion.
- **Therapeutic Targets**:
    - Every point in the replication cycle is a real or potential target for therapeutic intervention.
    - **Reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase enzymes** as well as the process of **virus–target cell binding and fusion** have proven susceptible to pharmacologic disruption.

## HIV Genome

- **General Organization**:
    - Illustrated schematically in Figure 202-5.
    - Like other retroviruses, HIV-1 has genes encoding structural proteins:
        - **gag**: encodes proteins forming the virion core (e.g., p24 antigen).
        - **pol**: encodes enzymes responsible for protease processing, reverse transcription, and integration.
        - **env**: encodes the envelope glycoproteins.
- **Regulatory Genes**.
    - Contain regulatory elements involved in gene expression.
- **Genomic Differences: HIV-1 vs. HIV-2**:
    - HIV-2 lacks the **vpu** gene.
    - HIV-2 has a **vpx** gene not contained in HIV-1.

## Molecular Heterogeneity of HIV-1

- **Sequence Diversity**:
    - Molecular analyses of HIV isolates show varying levels of sequence diversity across all viral genome regions.
    - Envelope protein coding sequences differ from a few percent (among isolates from same individual) to over 50% (between HIV-1 groups M, N, O, P).
    - Changes tend to cluster in hypervariable regions.
- **Evolution Mechanisms**:
    - Simple base substitution.
    - Insertions and deletions.
    - Recombination.
    - Gain and loss of glycosylation sites.
- **Origin of Diversity**:
    - Arises directly from the **limited fidelity of reverse transcriptase** (tendency toward copying errors).
    - Balance of immune pressure and functional constraints influences regional variation within proteins.
        - **Envelope**: Exposed on virion surface, under immune selective pressure, extremely variable with mutation clusters in hypervariable domains.
        - **Reverse transcriptase**: Important enzymatic functions, relatively conserved, especially around the active site.
    - Extraordinary variability of HIV-1 contrasts markedly with the relative stability of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2..
        - CRFs are generated when an individual is infected with two subtypes that recombine, creating a virus with a selective advantage.
            - Examples: CRF01_AE (common in Southeast Asia), CRF02_AG (West and Central Africa).
    - **Subtype C**: Dominates the global pandemic, likely accounting for ~50% of prevalent infections worldwide.
        - Most infections in sub-Saharan Africa are subtype C, with smaller proportions of A, D, CRF02_AG.
        - In South Africa, 98% of sequenced isolates are subtype C.
        - In India, >95% of infections are subtype C.
        - Solid data on variations in transmissibility between subtypes are lacking, despite speculation.
    - **Subtype B**: Overwhelmingly predominant in the United States, Canada, parts of South America, Western Europe, and Australia.
        - Thought to be due to a founder effect from late 1970s seeding.
- **Co-circulating Subtypes and Recombination**:
    - Many countries have co-circulating viral subtypes giving rise to new CRFs.
    - Recombination occurs when an individual is infected with more than one subtype, especially in geographic overlap areas and injection drug use sub-epidemics.
- **Implications of Diversity**:
    - Potential for differential rates of transmission and disease progression.
    - Development of resistance to antiretroviral drugs.
    - May be a formidable obstacle to HIV vaccine development (requires]

|Exposure Act|Estimated Per-Act Probability of Acquiring HIV (%)|
|:--|:--|
|Transfusion of contaminated blood products|>90|
|Unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI)|~1.4|
|Injection drug use (contaminated needle)|~0.6|
|Male-to-female vaginal intercourse|0.08|
|Female-to-male vaginal intercourse|0.04|
|Percutaneous injury (e.g., needle stick)|~0.23|
|Mucous membrane exposure|~0.09|
|Nonintact skin exposure|<0.09|
|Oral sex|Extremely low|

### Sexual Transmission

- **Prevalence**: Predominantly a sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide.
    - Most common mode in developing countries: heterosexual transmission.
    - In many Western countries: male-to-male sexual transmission dominates.
- - Demonstrated in cervical smears and vaginal fluid.
- **Anal Intercourse**:
    - Elevated risk for unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) compared to unprotected receptive vaginal intercourse.
    - Estimated per-act risk for URAI: ~1.4%.
    - Higher risk likely due to thin, fragile rectal mucosal membrane and micro-trauma.
    - Anal douching and practices traumatizing rectal mucosa increase likelihood of infection.
    - Provides two infection modalities: direct inoculation into blood (traumatic tears) and infection of susceptible target cells (e.g., Langerhans cells) in mucosa (absence of trauma).
    - Insertive anal intercourse also confers increased risk to receptive partner compared to insertive vaginal intercourse (vaginal mucosa thicker, less traumatized).
- **Vaginal Intercourse**: Virus can be transmitted to either partner.
    - Male-to-female transmission is more efficient than female-to-male.
    - Differences possibly due to prolonged exposure of vaginal/cervical mucosa to infected seminal fluid, and endometrium exposure when semen enters cervical os.
    - Uninfected male partner's penis/urethral orifice are exposed relatively briefly.
- **Cofactors for Heterosexual Transmission**:
    - **Presence of other STIs**: Strongly associated.
        - **Genital ulcerations** (e.g., _Treponema pallidum_, _Haemophilus ducreyi_, HSV): closely linked to transmission due to susceptibility and infectivity .
- **Quantity of HIV-1 (Viral Load)**:
    - Primary determinant of transmission risk.
    - Mean serum HIV RNA significantly higher in infected subjects whose partners seroconverted.
    - Transmission rare when plasma level <1700 copies/mL, even with genital ulcer disease.
    - Highest transmission rate per coital act during early infection (high plasma HIV RNA) and advanced disease (high viral set points).
- **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**:
    - Dramatically reduces plasma viremia and transmission risk.
    - "Treatment as prevention" (TasP).
    - If viral load reduced to undetectable levels by ART, "undetectable equals untransmittable" (U=U) principle applies to heterosexuals and men who have sex with men.
- **Male Circumcision**:
    - Associated with lower risk of HIV acquisition for heterosexual men.
    - Also protective against HIV acquisition for men who have sex with men reporting mainly or circumcised men.
- **Oral Contraceptives**:
    - Some studies associate with increased HIV incidence, possibly due to drug-induced changes in cervical mucosa making it more vulnerable.
    - Adolescent girls may be more susceptible due to immature genital tract with increased cervical ectopy.
- **Oral Sex**:
    - Much less efficient mode of transmission than anal or vaginal intercourse.
    - Extremely low incidence of transmission.
    - Well-documented reports of HIV transmission likely from fellatio or cunnilingus.
    - Assumption that oral sex is completely safe is not warranted.
- **Alcohol and Illicit Drug Use**:
    - Associated with unsafe sexual behavior, increasing risk of sexual transmission.
    - Methamphetamine and "club drugs" (MDMA, ketamine, GHB, inhaled nitrites, sometimes with PDE-5 inhibitors like sildenafil) associated with risky sexual practices, particularly among men who have sex with men.

### Transmission Through Injection Drug Use.g., antisocial personality disorder).

```
*   Use of cocaine in injectable form or smoked as "crack".
*   Use of injection drugs in a geographic location with high HIV prevalence.
```

- **Per-act risk**: Approximately 0.6% with a contaminated needle.

### Transmission by Transfused Blood and Blood Products

- **Method**: Receiving HIV-contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, or transplanted tissue.
- **Pre-1985 Context**:
    - Vast majority of such infections in resource-rich countries occurred before spring 1985 (when mandatory testing of donated blood for HIV-1 began).
    - Estimated >90% of individuals exposed to HIV-contaminated blood products become infected.
    - Transfusions of whole blood, packed red blood cells, platelets, leukocytes, and plasma are all capable of transmitting HIV.
    - Hyperimmune gamma globulin, hepatitis B immune globulin, plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine, and Rho immune globulin have _not_ been associated with HIVologic testing for infections with shared risk factors (e.g., hepatitis B and C, syphilis).
    - Chance of infection for hemophiliacs via clotting factor concentrates has been essentially eliminated due to standard screening and heat treatment.
    - Estimated risk of infection in the United States via transfused screened blood: approximately 1 in 2 million units.
    - Complete elimination of risk is unlikely given large annual transfusions.
- **Ongoing Threat**: Transmission by blood or blood products is still an ongoing threat in certain developing countries where routine screening is not universally practiced.
    - Sporadic breakdowns in screening procedures have been reported in some countries, resulting in small patient clusters.

### Occupational Transmission of HIV: Health Care Workers, Laboratory Workers, and the Health Care Setting

- **Risk**: Small but definite occupational risk to health care workers and laboratory personnel, especially when sharp objects are used.
- **Sharps Injuries**:
    - More than 300,000 health care workers are stuck with needles or other sharp medical instruments in the United States each year.
    - Global number of HIV infections among health care workers attributable to sharps injuries estimated at 1000 cases/year (range, 200–5000).
- **Documented US Cases**:
    - 58 documented cases of occupational HIV transmission to health care workers reported by CDC.
    - 150 possible transmissions.
    - Only one confirmed case since 1999 (laboratory technician, needle puncture, live HIV culture, 2008).
- **Exposures and Risk Probabilities**:
    - **Potential risk exposures**: Percutaneous injuries (e.g., needle stick, cut with sharp object) or contact of mucous membrane or nonintact skin (chapped, abraded, dermatitis-affected) with blood, tissue, or other potentially infectious body fluids.
    - **Risk of HIV transmission** (if not treated with ART within 24 hours):
        - Following skin puncture from contaminated needle/sharp object from documented HIV infection: **~0.2V infection risk following similar exposure: ~6–30% in nonimmune individuals.
            - Postexposure prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin and HBV vaccine initiation is >90% effective.
        - HCV infection risk following percutaneous injury: ~1.8%.
- **Postexposure Prophylaxis (PEP)**:
    - All health care workers experiencing puncture wound or mucous membrane exposures involving blood from a patient with documented HIV infection should be treated prophylactically with **combination antiretroviral therapy (ART)**. eces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus.
    - Rare cases of HIV transmission via human bites have been reported, but not in occupational settings.
- **Factors Associated with Increased Risk for Occupational Transmission**:
    - Exposures involving a relatively **large quantity of blood** (e.g., device visibly contaminated, hollow-bore needle placed directly in vein or artery).
    - **Deep injury**.
    - For mucocutaneous transmission: unusually large volume of blood and prolonged contact.
    - Exposure to blood from **untreated patients with high levels of HIV in the blood**.
- **Transmission from Health Care Worker to Patients**:
    - Rare instances where transmission seemed highly probable.
    - Risk is **extremely low** in developed countries—too low to be measured accurately.
    - Several retrospective epidemiologic studies tracing thousands of patients of HIV-infected providers (dentists, physicians, surgeons, obstetricians, gynecologists) found no linked transmissions other than identified documented cases.
- **Infection Control Breaches**:
    - Reuse of contaminated syringes, failure to properly sterilize surgical instruments, and/or hemodialysis equipment have rarely resulted in patient-to-patient HIV transmission in various settings.
    - These occurrences underscore the importance of **universal precautions** when caring for all patients.
- **Management of Occupational Exposures**:
    - Considered a **medical emergency** for timely management and PEP administration.
    - 53].
    - Emphasis on adherence to PEP and close follow-up: counseling, baseline/follow-up HIV testing, monitoring for drug toxicity.
    - Follow-up appointments: begin within 72 hours of exposure, concluded 4 months after exposure.
    - **National Clinicians’ Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline (PEPline)** (888-448-4911) available for consultation.
- **Minimizing Risk for Health Care Workers**:
    - immunization**: Advisable for all health care workers dealing with HIV-infected patients due to high prevalence of HBV in this population.
    - **TB prevention**:
        - All health care workers should know their PPD status, checked yearly.
        - Receive 6 months of isoniazid if skin test converts to positive.
        - Patients suspected of active pulmonary TB placed in respiratory isolation immediately.
        - Drug-resistant TB strains make it an increasing problem for health care workers, especially those with pre-existing HIV infection**.
    - Studies in Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo: 23–30% before birth, 50–65% during birth, 12–20% via breast-feeding.
- **Probability (without ART)**:
    - Ranges from **15–25% in industrialized countries**.
    - Ranges from **25–35% in developing countries** (differences may relate to prenatal care adequacy, mother's disease stage/general health).
- **Risk Factors for Increased MTCT**:
    - **High maternal levels of plasma viremia**: best documented factor, risk increases linearly with viral load.
        - Very unlikely if maternal plasma viremia is <1000 copies HIV RNA/mL.
        - Extremely unlikely if <50 copies/mL.
    - **Closer human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match** between mother and child.
    - **Prolonged interval between membrane rupture and delivery**.
    - Potential risk factors (not consistently demonstrated): chorioamnionitis at delivery, STIs during pregnancy, illicit drug use during pregnancy, cigarette smoking, preterm delivery, obstetrical procedures (amniocentesis, amnioscopy, fetal scalp electrodes, episiotomy).
- **Impact of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**:
    - Rate of MTCT has fallen to **less than 1%** in pregnant women receiving ART for HIV infection.
    - ART combined with cesarean section delivery has made MTCT an extremely unusual event].
    - Risk highest in early months.
    - Exclusive breast-feeding reported to carry a lower risk than mixed feeding.
    - In developed countries: breast-feeding by an HIV-infected mother is **contraindicated** (alternative nutrition like formulas available).
    - In developing countries: continuation of ART in the infected mother during breast-feeding markedly diminishes the risk of transmission to the infant.
    - ART for pregnant women should be provided for the benefit of the woman as much as for prevention of MTCT, and continued beyond pregnancy clearance.
    - Multiple soluble salivary factors (e.g., secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor - SLPI) inhibit HIV _in vitro_, probably by targeting host cell receptors.
        - Higher salivary SLPI levels in breast-fed infants were associated with decreased risk of HIV transmission through breast milk.
    - Submandibular saliva may reduce HIV infectivity by stripping gp120 from virions.
    - Saliva-mediated disruption and lysis of HIV-infected cells occurs due to the hypotonicity of oral secretions.
- **Human Bite**: Transmission can occur but is a rare event.
- **Tears, Sweat, Urine**: Although virus can be identified (if not isolated) from virtually any body fluid, there is no evidence that HIV transmission can occur from exposure to tears, sweat, or urine.
- **Other Body Fluids (potentially contaminated with blood)**:
    - Isolated cases of HIV transmission by body fluids that may or may not have been contaminated with blood have been reported.
    - Most occurred in settings where a close relative provided intensive nursing care for an HIV-infected person withoutincome countries.
    - Around 50% are female, and 1.7 million are children <15 years.
    - The estimated number of people living with HIV (global prevalence) has increased nearly fivefold since 1990.
        - Reflects continued high rates of new HIV infections and the life-prolonging impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART).
    - In 2020, global prevalence of HIV infection among persons 15–49 years of age was 0.7%, with wide regional/country variation.
- **New HIV Infections (Global, 2020)**:
    - Estimated 1.5 million new cases occurred worldwide, including 150,000 among children <15 years.
    - About one-third of new infections were among people aged 15–24 years.
    - **High-risk populations disproportionately affected**: Sex workers; people who inject drugs; transgender people; prisoners; gay men and other men who have sex with men; the clients of997 to 2020.
    - **~70% reduction in HIV infections among children <15 years** during the same period.
        - Progress due largely to increasing availability of antiretroviral medications to prevent mother-to-infant transmission.
    - Estimated 27.5 million people globally were on ART as of December 2020.
    - **Global AIDS deaths totaled 680,000 in 2020** (including 99,0 Europe, but very likely began in sub-Saharan Africa, a region particularly devastated.
    - **Eastern and Southern Africa**:
        - Home to ~6% of world’s population but had 20.6 million people living with HIV in 2020 (>50% of global total).
        - Almost all countries have generalized epidemics (national prevalence >1%).
        - Eight countries: >10% of adult population (15–49 years) has HIV infection.
        - **South Africa**: highest number of people living with HIV in the world (7.8 million).
        - **Eswatini (formerly Swaziland)**: highest adult HIV prevalence globally (26.8%).
        - Recent data indicate declining HIV incidence and prevalence in many countries, though generally remaining high.
        - Heterosexual exposure is the primary mode of HIV transmission.
        - Women and girls account for ~60% of all HIV infections in the region.
    - **Western and Central Africa**: [4 most HIV transmission.
    - **Middle East and North Africa**:
        - One of the lowest HIV prevalence rates globally (<0.1%).
        - New infections increased by 7% from 2010 to 2020.
        - 2020: estimated 230,000 people living with HIV.
        - Cases largely concentrated among IDUs, men who have sex with men, and sex workers and their clients.
    - **Asia all people living with HIV in the region.
        - Key populations (sex workers, IDUs, transgender, prisoners, MSM) and their partners accounted for ~94% of new infections in 2020.
        - ~30% of new infections among young people (15–24 years).
        - Rising new infections among gay men and men who have sex with men is a major concern.
    - **Eastern Europe and Central Asia**:
        - HIV epidemic continues to expand: end of 2020.
        - Rate of new HIV infections remained steady from 2010 to 2020.

    - **Caribbean**:
        - Estimated 330,000 people living with HIV.
    - **North America and Western and Central Europe**:
        - Approximately 2.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2020.
        - Modes of transmission vary; HIV disproportionately affects men who have sex with men.
        - Western and Central Europe: 11 countries saw HIV infections decline >20% (2010-2020), while 16 (mostly Central Europe) experienced increases or limited declines.
        - North America: decreases in HIV diagnoses among gay/bisexual men and heterosexuals, small increase among people who inject drugs.

### HIV Infection in the United States of medical care**: Defined as ≥1 test (CD4 count or viral load).

- **Demographics of HIV-Infected Individuals (US)**:
    - Nearly two-thirds are Black0s (~130,000 per year).
    - Progress has stalled in recent years, at about **34,000 to 38,000 new HIV infections each year**.
- **Distribution of Incident HIV Cases (2019)**:
    - Not evenly distributed across states and regions.
    - Concentrated in urban areas in most of the country.
    - Southern US: larger percentages of diagnoses in smaller metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas [56 were newly diagnosed with HIV infection, down from a peak of ~1750 in 1991.
- **HIV-Related Deaths (US)**:
    - Rate rose steadily through 1980s, peaked in 1995.
    - Fallen fourfold since 1995.
    - Likely due to: improved prophylaxis/treatment of opportunistic infections, growing experience in HIV care, improved access to health care, decrease in new infections.
    - **Most influential factor**: increased use of combination ART.

## Pathophysiology and Pathogenesis

- **Hallmark**: Profound immunodeficiency, primarily from progressive quantitative and qualitative deficiency of helper CD4+ T lymphocytes.
    - Occurs in a setting of aberrant immune activation.
    - CD4 molecule: primary cellular receptor for HIV.
    - Co-receptor also required with CD4 for efficient binding, fusion, and entry.
    - HIV-1 uses **CCR5** and **CXCR4** as major co-re resulting in cellular dysfunction.
- **Clinical Consequences**:
    - Patients with CD4+ T-cell levels below certain thresholds are at high risk of opportunistic diseases, especially AIDS-defining infections and neoplasms.
    - Some AIDS features (Kaposi’s sarcoma, neurologic abnormalities) can occur prior to severe immunologic impairment.
- **Multifactorial and Multiphasic Pathogenesis**:
    - Complex and varied combination of viral pathogenic and immunopathogenic events throughout HIV disease.
    - Pathogenic mechanisms differ at different disease stages.
    - Essential to consider typical clinical course of untreated individuals.

### Early Events in HIV Infection: Primary Infection and Initial Dissemination of Virus

- **Mucosal Transmission**:
    - Earliest events (within hours) following HIV exposure to mucosal surface determine infection establishment.
    - Mucosal barrier is relatively effective in limiting HIV access to susceptible targets.
    - Virus can cross barrier by transport on Langerhans cells (epidermal DCs) or through microscopic rents.
    - Significant disruptions ( of virus.
    - Infection established if basic reproductive rate (R0) becomes equal to or greater than 1.
- **Replication and Dissemination**:
    - Once established, virus replicates in lymphoid cells in mucosa, submucosa, and draining lymphoreticular tissues.
    - **"Eclipse" phase**: Virus typically not detected in plasma for a few to several days.
    - Within several days to weeks, virus is disseminated: first to draining lymph nodes, then other lymphoid compartments with dense CD4+ T-cell targets.
    - Leads to a burst of high-level plasma viremia, readily detectable.
    - **Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)**: a major target of HIV infection.
        - Location where large numbers of CD4+ T cells (usually memory cells) are infected and depleted (by direct viral effects and activation-associated apoptosis).
    - Once virus replication reaches threshold and is widely disseminated, infection is firmly established throughout the body's lymphoid tissues and persists for life.
- certain viruses.
    - Characteristics of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (at least in subtype A and C viruses) significantly influence transmission.
    - **"Founder viruses"**: transmitting viruses are usually underrepresented in the transmitting partner's circulating viremia.
        - They are less-diverged, with shorter V1–V2 loop sequences and fewer predicted N-linked glycosylation sites relative to major circulating variants.
        - Almost exclusively R5 strains and usually sensitive to neutralizing antibody.
    - Once replication proceeds in the mononucleosis-like symptoms correlate with high plasma viremia.
    - Virtually all patients develop some degree of plasma viremia, contributing to virus dissemination, even if asymptomatic.
    - Initial plasma viremia level does not necessarily determine disease progression rate.
    - **Viral set point**: The level of steady-state plasma viremia after ~1 year correlates with the rate of disease progression in the untreated patient and with immunologic and virologic aberrancies that persist in the treated patient.
    - Strikingly high viremia in acute HIV infection is associated with* This chronic, persistent infection is the **hallmark of HIV disease**.
    - Virus replication can invariably be detected in untreated patients by molecular assays (plasma HIV RNA).
    - Levels range greatly (fewer than 50 to >1 million copies/mL plasma).
    - Even in treated patients with suppressed plasma viremia (<20–50 copies/mL), there is a continual low level of virion production.
    - In contrast to most human viral infections (where host clears virus and develops immunity), HIV infection rarely kills during primary infection.
    - Unlike viruses that enter true latency with microbiologic latency (e.g., HSV), HIV infection is characterized by persistent replication during clinical latency.
    - Chronicity with persistent virus replication can also be seen in HBV and HCV, but in these, the immune system is not a target of the virus.
- **Escape of HIV from Effective Immune System Control**:
    - Inherent to chronicity is the virus's ability to evade adequate control and elimination by cellular and humoral immune responses.
    - **Mechanisms of Evasion**:
        - **Sustained replication and viral diversity**: High rate of virus replication leads to generation of viral diversity via mutation and recombination.
        - **Escape from CTLs**: Selection of mutants that escape control by CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is critical to propagation and progression.
        - **Antibody ineffectiveness**: High rate of virus replication and inevitable mutations contribute to inability of antibody to neutralize and/or clear the autologous virus.
        - **Delayed neutralizing antibodies**: Humoral immune system does not readily produce classic neutralizingPD) 1, T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain–containing molecule 3 (Tim-3), and lymphocyte activating gene 3 (Lag-3).
            - These restrict polyreactivity and proliferative capacity, essential for effective killing.
        - **HLA class I downregulation**: Viral proteins **Nef, Tat, and Vpu** downregulate HLA class I molecules on infected cells, preventing CD8+ CTL recognition and killing.
            - While seemingly favoring NK cell elimination, this latter  **Extensive glycosylation** of the envelope.
    - **Conformational masking** of neutralizing epitopes.
    - Virus continually mutates to escape emerging antibody responses.
    - Broadly neutralizing antibodies capable of neutralizing a wide range of primary HIV isolates _in vitro_ occur in only ~20% of infected individuals.
        - When they occur, 2-3 years of infection with continual virus replication are generally required for their affinity maturation.
        - By the time formed, they are ineffective in containing the virus currently replicating in the patient.
    - Persistent viremia results in B cell exhaustion, similar to CD8+ T cells, contributing to humoral response defects.
- **CD4+ T-cell Help and Loss**:
    - CD4+ T-cell help is essential for integrity of humoral and cell-mediated antigen-specific immune responses.
    - HIV preferentially infects activated CD4+ T cells, including HIV-specific CD4+ T cells.
    - This loss of viral-specific helper T-cell responses has T cells**, referred to as the **viral reservoir**.
    - This reservoir may not be recognized or completely eliminated by virus-specific CTLs or ART.
    - Despite potent immune response and marked viral downregulation post-primary infection, HIV establishes chronic infection with variable persistent replication.
    - During this period, most patients transition from acute primary infection to clinical latency or smoldering disease activity.

### The HIV Reservoir: Obstacles to the Eradication of Virus

- **Definition**: A pool of **latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells** exists in virtually all HIV-infected individuals, including those on ART.
    - These cells carry an integrated form of HIV DNA in the host genome.
    - Can remain in this state until an activation signal drives HIV transcript expression.
    - Only a small fraction contain replication-competent virus; overwhelming majority contain defective proviruses incapable of full replication.
    - Upon activation, variable degrees of sustained virus replication invariably occur.
- **Types of Latency**:
    - The pool of cells in postintegration latency is established early during primary HIV infection.
    - Persists despite plasma viremia suppression to <50 copies/mL by potent ART for several years.
    - Can give rise to replication-competent virus upon cellular activation _ex vivo_.
    - Modeling studies estimate many years to entire host lifetime for elimination, which has not been documented spontaneously.
    - Likely due to long-lived latent reservoir, continual replenishment by low levels of persistent virus replication (below current assay limits), and proliferation," despite favorable clinical outcomes from ART.
- **Current Efforts**: Directed toward achieving ART-free HIV remission through passive transfer of long-acting broadly neutralizing antibodies and therapeutic agents enhancing host immune responses.

### Viral Dynamics

- **Quantification**: Dynamics of viral production and turnover quantified using mathematical modeling with reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors.
- **Viremia Decline**: Treatment resulted in a precipitous decline in plasma viremia (>90% within 2 weeks).
- **Origin of Circulating Virus**: 10^10–10^11 virions) produced and cleared daily.
- **Replication Cycle Duration**: Minimal duration of HIV-1 replication cycle _in vivo_ is ~2 days.
- **Lymphoid Tissue Role**: Decrease in plasma viremia with ART correlates with decreased virus replication in lymph nodes, confirming lymphoid tissue as main site of HIV replication and main source of plasma viremia.
- **Viral Set Point**:
    - The level of steady-state viremia at ~1 year following HIV acquisition.
    - Has important prognostic implications for HIV disease progression in untreated patients.
    - Untreated individuals with a low set point progress to AIDS much more slowly than those with a very high set point.

### Clinical Latency versus Microbiologic Latency

- **CD4+ T Cell Decline**: In viremic HIV-infected individuals without ART, CD4+ T cells in blood inevitably decrease progressively.
    - Can be gradual or abrupt (latter often reflects significant spike in plasma viremia).
- **Clinical Latency HIV RNA per milliliter in the absence of therapy, there is virtually always some degree of low-level ongoing virus replication.

### Advanced HIV Disease

- In untreated patients or those with inadequately controlled virus replication, after a variable period (usually years), the **CD4+ T-cell count falls below a critical level (<200/µL)**.
    
- Patient becomes **highly susceptible to opportunistic disease**.
    
- CDC case definition of stage 3 (AIDS) includes all HIV-infected individuals >5 years of age with CD4+ Long-Term Survivors, Long-Term Nonprogressors, and Elite Controllers
    
- **Distinction**: Long-term nonprogressors are by definition long-term survivors, but the reverse is not always true.
    
- **Long-Term Survivors (General)**:
    
    - Early predictions (pre-ART): ~13% of homosexual/bisexual men infected early might remain free of clinical AIDS for >20 years. Many gradually progressed immunologically but survived.
    - With effective ART, survival of HIV-infected individuals has dramatically increased [ several thousand copies), and clinically stable without ART.
    - Approximately 5–15% of HIV-infected individuals fell into this category.
    - A significant proportion eventually progressed and required ART.
- **Elite Controllers (ECs)**:
    
    - A much smaller subgroup (fraction of 1% of HIV-infected individuals) from the broader LTNP group.
    - By definition: extremely low plasma viremia (often undetectable by standard assays) and normal CD4+ T-cell counts.
    - Their
    - Virus replication occurs mainly in lymphoid tissue, not blood; plasma viremia directly reflects virus production in lymphoid tissue.
- **Lymphadenopathy**:
    
    - Some patients experience progressive generalized lymphadenopathy early in infection.
    - Others have varying degrees of transient lymphadenopathy.
    - Reflects cellular activation and immune response in lymphoid tissue, characterized by follicular or germinal center hyperplasia.
    - Lymphoid tissue involvement is common in virtually all patients, even those without detectable lymphadenopathy.
- ** Following mucosal transmission, virus replication amplifies from scattered lymphoid cells in the gut lamina propria to draining lymph nodes, leading to high plasma viremia.
    
    - GALT plays a major role in amplifying virus replication, disseminating virus to peripheral lymphoid tissues.
    - Profound cellular activation occurs within lymphoid tissues, reflected in follicular or germinal center hyperplasia.
    - Copious amounts of extracellular virions (infectious and defective) are trapped on the processes of **follicular dendritic cells (FDCs)** in lymph node germinal centers. further virus replication.
- **Architectural Changes with Disease Progression**:
    
    - **Early stages**: Lymphoid tissue architecture generally preserved, may be hyperplastic due to increased B cells and **follicular helper CD4+ T cells (TFH)** in prominent germinal centers.
        - Extracellular virions seen attached to FDC processes.
        - FDC functions (antigen presentation to B cells, CXCL13 secretion for B and TFH retention) and TFH factors contribute to B-cell memory., but associated with collagen deposition (fibrosis) and shift in cytokine expression (decreases in IL-7 and lymphotoxin-α; increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-β).
    - **Advanced stage**: Complete disruption of lymphoid tissue architecture, accompanied by dissolution of FRC and FDC networks ("burnt out" lymph nodes).
    - This destruction compounds immunodeficiency, contributing to inability to control HIV replication and inability to mount adequate immune responses against opportunistic pathogens and vaccination.
    - SIV/HIV infection studies in GALT show
    
    1. Promotes HIV replication.
    2. Induces immune dysfunction.
    3. Increases incidence of chronic conditions (e.g., premature cardiovascular disease).

### Conditions Associated with Persistent Immune Activation and Inflammation in Patients with HIV Infection

_(Note: The content of Table 202-4 is listed below, as described in the text.)_

- Premature cardiovascular disease
- Bone fragility
- Certain cancers
- Diabetes
- IL-6 and type I interferons)
- Elevated levels of: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), D-dimer, neopterin, β2-microglobulin, soluble (s) CD14, sTNFR, sCD27, sCD163, and sCD40L
- Autoimmune phenomena

### Induction of HIV Replication by Aberrant Immune Activation

- **Chronic Activation**: Immune**: Quiescent CD4+ T cells can be infected (inefficiently), but reverse transcription, integration, and virus spread are much more efficient in activated cells.
- **Viral Expression**: Cellular activation induces expression of virus in latently infected cells.
- **Driving Force**: Immune activation and inflammation provide the "engine" that drives HIV replication.
- **Exogenous Factors**: Other microbes associated with heightened cellular activation can enhance HIV replication, playing a role in pathogenesis.
    - **Co-infections**: *. * HIV patients more likely to develop active TB and reactivate latent TB. * Active TB can accelerate HIV infection course. * Plasma viremia levels greatly elevated in HIV patients with active TB (not on ART) compared to pre-TB levels and levels after successful TB treatment. *  **Malaria**: Acute infection with _Plasmodium falciparum_ increases viral load in HIV patients; reversed by effective malaria treatment.

### Microbial Translocation and Persistent Immune Activation

- **Mechanism**: for defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi).
    - Alterations in gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.

### Persistent Immune Activation and Inflammation Induce Immune Dysfunction

- **Manifestations of Activated State**:
    - Hyperactivation of B cells leading to hypergammaglobulinemia.
    - Increased lymphocyte turnover.
    - Activation of monocytes.
    - Expression of activation markers and immune checkpoint receptors on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
    - Increased activation-associated cellular Autoimmune phenomena.
- **Direct Viral Protein Effects**: Even without direct target cell infection, HIV envelope proteins can interact with cellular receptors (CD4 molecules and chemokine receptors) to deliver potent activation signals.
    - Results in calcium flux, phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins, co-localization of cytoplasmic proteins, immune dysfunction, and under certain circumstances, apoptosis and pyroptosis.
- **Functional Exhaustion**:
    - Chronic exposure of the immune system to a particular antigen over an extended period may ultimately lead to an inability to sustain an adequate immune response [9+ T cells.
- **Bystander Effects**: The ability of the immune system to respond to a broad spectrum of non-HIV antigens may be compromised if immunocompetent bystander cells are maintained in a state of chronic activation.
- **Role of Immunoregulatory Mechanisms**:
    - Deleterious effects of chronic immune activation on HIV disease progression are well established.
    - Host must maintain sufficient antigen-specific responses but prevent excessive activation/immune-mediated tissue damage.
    - Normal immunoregulatory mechanisms (e * Aberrant cellular activation in HIV disease correlated with heightened apoptosis.
    - HIV can trigger activation-induced cell death through upregulation of death receptors (Fas/CD95, TNFR1, TRAIL receptors 1 and 2).
    - Their corresponding ligands (FasL, TNF, TRAIL) are also upregulated in HIV disease.
    - HIV-induced stress and alterations in homeostasis can trigger intrinsic apoptosis due to downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins like Bcl-2.
    - Other mechanisms of HIV-induced cell death:].
    - Intensity of apoptosis correlates with general immune system activation, not disease stage or viral burden.
    - Rate of apoptosis is elevated in HIV infection, seen in "bystander" cells (CD8+ T cells, B cells) and uninfected CD4+ T cells.
    - Likely that bystander apoptosis of immunocompetent cells contributes to general immunologic abnormalities in HIV disease.

### Medical Conditions Associated with Persistent Immune Activation and Inflammation in HIV Disease

- As HIV-infected individuals survive longer, a number of previously-infected individuals.
- **Etiology**: Reflect, at least in part, chronic immune activation and dysregulation of B and T cells.
- **Clinical Manifestations**: Wide spectrum described, usually in absence of overt autoimmune disease.
    - Antibodies against autoantigens on intact lymphocytes/other cells, or against proteins released from dying cells.
    - Antiplatelet and anti-erythrocyte antibodies (contribute to thrombocytopenia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia).
    - Antibodies to nuclear and cytoplasmic components, cardiolipin and phospholipids, surface receptors (including CD4), and serum proteins reported.
    - These manifestations are relatively low in the era of ART.
    - **Molecular mimicry**: From opportunistic pathogens or HIV itself, can be a trigger or cofactor.
        - Antibodies against HIV envelope proteins (especially gp41) often cross-react with host proteins (e.g., MPER of gp41 reacts with phospholipids/cardiolipin).
        - Polyreactive HIV-specific antibodies may be beneficial.
- characterized by paradoxical deterioration of clinical condition.
- Usually compartmentalized to a particular organ system.
- Associated with a decrease in viral load and at least partial recovery of immune competence (usually increased CD4+ T-cell counts).
- **Immunopathogenesis**: Related to an increase in immune response against residual antigens (usually microbial).
- Most commonly seen with underlying mycobacterial (_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ [TB] or _M. avium complex_[MAC]), fungal (cryptococcal), and viral (CMV* Potent proinflammatory "cytokine storm" induced, likely a response to high-level virus replication.
- Induced cytokines and chemokines: Type I interferon **IFN-α, IL-15, and CXCL10**.
- Followed by **IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α**.
- Delayed peak of the anti-inflammatory cytokine **IL-10**.
- Soluble factors of innate immunity induced: **neopterin and β-+ T cells homeostasis, and influence virus variants selected during transmission bottleneck.
- **Chronic Phase**:
    - Cytokines elevated during chronic phase and linked to immune activation: **IFN-γ, RANTES (CCL5), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β (CCL4), and IL-18**.
    - **Specific Factors and Associations**:
        - **IP-10**: Plasma levels predictive of disease progression.
        - **IL-6, soluble IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-6**: Increased expression in lymph nodes of HIV-infected individuals prior to disease progression.
        - Shift to **TGF-β** in advanced disease.
        - **RANTES (CCL5), MIP-1α (CCL3), and MIP-1β (CCL4)**: Inhibit infection by and spread of R5 HIV-1 strains.
        - **Stromal cell–derived factor (SDF) 1**: Inhibits infection by and spread of X4 strains. _In vivo_ or _in vitro_labeling studies show tight correlation between degree of lymphocyte turnover and plasma viremia.
- **Affected Cells**: Seen in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes as well as B lymphocytes.
    - Observed in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue.
- **Dynamic Shift**: Mathematical models suggest lymphoid pool consists of dynamically distinct subpopulations.
    - Major consequence of HIV infection appears to be a **shift in cells from a more quiescent pool to a pool with a higher turnover rate**.

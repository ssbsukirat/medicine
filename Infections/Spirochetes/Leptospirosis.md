- globally important zoonotic disease
- Recent outbreaks on all major continents
- Asymptomatic to fulminant fatal disease 
- May have nonspecific symptomike fever headache myalgia
- Severe is jaundice, renal dysfunction and conjunctival injection -- ***Weil's syndrome***
- Severe pulmonary hemorrhage maybe without jaundice as well
# Etiological Agent 
- order Spirochaetales 
- Family Leptospiraceae 
- Coiled thin highly motile organisms 
- Hooked ends and 2 periplasmic flagella 
- 6-20um long and 0.2um diameter
- Stain poorly but seen with dark field examination
- Earlier 2 species (L. interrogans and L. biflexa)
- Now 64 species identifed (17 pathogenic, 21 intermediate)
- Now classified on basis of serovars according to antigenic group (260 serovars in 26 subgroups)
# Epidemiology
- tropics and subtropics mainly 
- Tropical climate and poor hygiene allow survival and distribution of pathogen 
- 1 million cases a year and 10% case fatality rate 
- Zoonosis
    - almost all mammalian species and are veterinary burden 
    - ***Rodents like rats most important reservoir***
    - Also in domestic and farm animals 
    - Symbiotic relationship with host and may persist in urogenital tract for years 
    - Icterohaemorrhagiae and Copenhageni with rats 
    - Grippotyphosa with voles 
    - Hardjo with cattle 
    - Canicola with dogs 
    - Pomona with pigs 
- Both endemic and epidemic 
- Transmission by 
    - Direct contact with urine, blood or tissue if infected animal 
    - Exposure to environmental contamintion (more common)
    - Human to human transmission may occur
    - Water is important as survives in humid environment -- floods oftenresponsible for outbreaks but may occur without flood also 
- Most infections cause no or mild disease

- most common is acute cystitis
- Cystitis is symptomatic infection of bladder 
- Pyelonephritis is symptomatic infection of kidney parenchyma
- Uncomplicated UTI is infection confined to bladder or acute cystitis
- Complicated UTI is extension beyond bladder like fever or signs of systemic illness
- Recurrent UTIs may not always be complicated 
- CAUTI is catheter associated UTI
- Men with UTI are not automatically considered complicated
# Epidemiology and risk factors
- females more than males 
- neonates male > female due to congenital tract anomalies
- >50 years age men=women due to prostate enlargement
- Cystitis
    - most common
    - Recent diaphragm use (with spermicide)
    - Frequent sexual intercourse -- dose dependent relationship
    - History of UTI
    - Diabetes mellitus
    - Incontinence 
- Pyelonephritis
    - frequent sexual intercourse
    - New partner
    - UTI in last 12 months 
    - Maternal history of UTI
    - Diabetes
    - Incontinence
- 20% have relapse after 1st episode
    - early is relapse (2weeks) and should be evaluated for sequestered focus of infection
    - Clustering may happen (multiple recurrence after single episode)
        - new risk factor
        - Sloughing of protective bladder wall 
        - Effect of antibiotic on microbiome 
    - Risk factors
        - sexual intercourse
        - Spermicide use 
- Asymptomatic bacturia (asymptomatic colonisation)
    - usually no need to treat
    - In pregnancy risk factor of pyelonephritis
    - Treatment with antibiotics reduced risk of pyelonephritis, pre-term baby and LBW baby 
- Men 
    - most have functional or anatomical anomaly
    - Most common is obstruction of tract secondary to prostate hypertrophy
    - <45 years age may not have abnormalities
    - Lack of circumcision is risk as E coli infection more in glans and prepuce 
- Women with diabetes = 2-3x higher risk of ASB and UTI as compared to without diabetes
    - duration of diabetes and use of insulin increase risk
    - other risk factors like poor bladder function, obstruction in flow and incomplete voiding

# Etiology
- usually enteric gram negative rods 
- Acute uncomplicated cystitis usually has E coli in 75-90%

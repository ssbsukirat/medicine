- most common is acute cystitis
- Cystitis is symptomatic infection of bladder 
- Pyelonephritis is symptomatic infection of kidney parenchyma
- Uncomplicated UTI is infection confined to bladder or acute cystitis
- Complicated UTI is extension beyond bladder like fever or signs of systemic illness
- Recurrent UTIs may not always be complicated 
- CAUTI is catheter associated UTI
- Men with UTI are not automatically considered complicated
# Epidemiology and risk factors
- females more than males 
- neonates male > female due to congenital tract anomalies
- >50 years age men=women due to prostate enlargement
- Cystitis
    - most common
    - Recent diaphragm use (with spermicide)
    - Frequent sexual intercourse -- dose dependent relationship
    - History of UTI
    - Diabetes mellitus
    - Incontinence 
- Pyelonephritis
    - frequent sexual intercourse
    - New partner
    - UTI in last 12 months 
    - Maternal history of UTI
    - Diabetes
    - Incontinence
- 20% have relapse after 1st episode
    - early is relapse (2weeks) and should be evaluated for sequestered focus of infection
    - Clustering may happen (multiple recurrence after single episode)
        - new risk factor
        - Sloughing of protective bladder wall 
        - Effect of antibiotic on microbiome 
    - Risk factors
        - sexual intercourse
        - Spermicide use 
- Asymptomatic bacturia (asymptomatic colonisation)
    - usually no need to treat
    - In pregnancy risk factor of pyelonephritis
    - Treatment with antibiotics reduced risk of pyelonephritis, pre-term baby and LBW baby 
- Men 
    - most have functional or anatomical anomaly
    - Most common is obstruction of tract secondary to prostate hypertrophy
    - <45 years age may not have abnormalities
    - Lack of circumcision is risk as E coli infection more in glans and prepuce 
- Women with diabetes = 2-3x higher risk of ASB and UTI as compared to without diabetes
    - duration of diabetes and use of insulin increase risk
    - other risk factors like poor bladder function, obstruction in flow and incomplete voiding

# Etiology
- usually enteric gram negative rods 
- Acute uncomplicated cystitis usually has E coli in 75-90% 
- Staphylococcus saprophyticus is 5-15% (more in younger women)
- Klebsiella, Enterococcus and citrobacter 5-10% 
- Uncomplicated pyelonephritis -- similar spectrum with E coli most common
- Complicated UTI (eg CAUTI)
    - e coli most common
    - Aerobic gram negative like pseudomonas, klebsiella, proteus, citrobacter, acinetobacger and morganella 
    - Gram positive like Enterococci and staphylococcus aureus 
    - Yeasts
# Pathogenesis
- tract is anatomical unit linked by continuous column of urine from urethra to kidneys 
- Most infections ascend from urethra to kidneys
- But always bacteria doesn't cause infection so it needs host, pathogens and environmental factors
- ![[UTIpathogenesis.PNG]]
- Foreign body in tract like a stone or catheter provides site for colonisation
- Abnormal micturition or significant post voidal urine volume 
- Hematogenous spread <2% and usually by bacteremia like salmonella and staphylococcus aureus
- Hematogenous spread may cause focal abcess or areas of pyelonephritis with positive urine culture
- Salmonella or staphylococcal isolation on culture without catheterisation or instrumentation should prompt search for blood source 
- Candida without instrumentation in immunocompetent means genital contamination or widespread visceral spread
## environmental factors
- Vaginal ecology
    - colonisation of introitus and periurethral area by intestinal flora like E coli is initial step 
    - Sexual intercourse increases risk of colonisation
    - Nonoxynol-9 in spermicide kills lactobacillus in vagina and increase risk 
    - Postmenopausal lactobacillus replaced by gram negative organism so increased risk 
- Anatomical and functional abnormalities
    - Urinary stasis or obstruction
    - Stones or Catheter
    - VUR, BPH, neurogenic bladder create favourable conditions for UTI
    - E coli without virulence factors can cause UTI
    - Reduced urinary peristalsis and decreased ureter tone --> reflux --

- most common is acute cystitis
- Cystitis is symptomatic infection of bladder 
- Pyelonephritis is symptomatic infection of kidney parenchyma
- Uncomplicated UTI is infection confined to bladder or acute cystitis
- Complicated UTI is extension beyond bladder like fever or signs of systemic illness
- Recurrent UTIs may not always be complicated 
- CAUTI is catheter associated UTI
- Men with UTI are not automatically considered complicated
# Epidemiology and risk factors
- females more than males 
- neonates male > female due to congenital tract anomalies
- >50 years age men=women due to prostate enlargement
- Cystitis
    - most common
    - Recent diaphragm use (with spermicide)
    - Frequent sexual intercourse -- dose dependent relationship
    - History of UTI
    - Diabetes mellitus
    - Incontinence 
- Pyelonephritis
    - frequent sexual intercourse
    - New partner
    - UTI in last 12 months 
    - Maternal history of UTI
    - Diabetes
    - Incontinence
- 20% have relapse after 1st episode
    - early is relapse (2weeks) and should be evaluated for sequestered focus of infection
    - Clustering may happen (multiple recurrence after single episode)
        - new risk factor
        - Sloughing of protective bladder wall 
        - Effect of antibiotic on microbiome 
    - Risk factors
        - sexual intercourse
        - Spermicide use 
- Asymptomatic bacturia (asymptomatic colonisation)
    - usually no need to treat
    - In pregnancy risk factor of pyelonephritis
    - Treatment with antibiotics reduced risk of pyelonephritis, pre-term baby and LBW baby 
- Men 
    - most have functional or anatomical anomaly
    - Most common is obstruction of tract secondary to prostate hypertrophy
    - <45 years age may not have abnormalities
    - Lack of circumcision is risk as E coli infection more in glans and prepuce 
- Women with diabetes = 2-3x higher risk of ASB and UTI as compared to without diabetes
    - duration of diabetes and use of insulin increase risk
    - other risk factors like poor bladder function, obstruction in flow and incomplete voiding

# Etiology
- usually enteric gram negative rods 
- Acute uncomplicated cystitis usually has E coli in 75-90% 
- Staphylococcus saprophyticus is 5-15% (more in younger women)
- Klebsiella, Enterococcus and citrobacter 5-10% 
- Uncomplicated pyelonephritis -- similar spectrum with E coli most common
- Complicated UTI (eg CAUTI)
    - e coli most common
    - Aerobic gram negative like pseudomonas, klebsiella, proteus, citrobacter, acinetobacger and morganella 
    - Gram positive like Enterococci and staphylococcus aureus 
    - Yeasts
# Pathogenesis
- tract is anatomical unit linked by continuous column of urine from urethra to kidneys 
- Most infections ascend from urethra to kidneys
- But always bacteria doesn't cause infection so it needs host, pathogens and environmental factors
- ![[UTIpathogenesis.PNG]]
- Foreign body in tract like a stone or catheter provides site for colonisation
- Abnormal micturition or significant post voidal urine volume 
- Hematogenous spread <2% and usually by bacteremia like salmonella and staphylococcus aureus
- Hematogenous spread may cause focal abcess or areas of pyelonephritis with positive urine culture
- Salmonella or staphylococcal isolation on culture without catheterisation or instrumentation should prompt search for blood source 
- Candida without instrumentation in immunocompetent means genital contamination or widespread visceral spread
## environmental factors
- Vaginal ecology
    - colonisation of introitus and periurethral area by intestinal flora like E coli is initial step 
    - Sexual intercourse increases risk of colonisation
    - Nonoxynol-9 in spermicide kills lactobacillus in vagina and increase risk 
    - Postmenopausal lactobacillus replaced by gram negative organism so increased risk 
- Anatomical and functional abnormalities
    - Urinary stasis or obstruction
    - Stones or Catheter
    - VUR, BPH, neurogenic bladder create favourable conditions for UTI
    - E coli without virulence factors can cause UTI
    - Reduced urinary peristalsis and decreased ureter tone --> reflux --> pyelonephritis in pregnancy
## Host factors
- genetic background especially in women 
- Familial disposition to UTI and pyelonephritis
- Recurrent UTI women have 1st episode<15 years and have maternal history
- Women with recurrent UTI have 3x binding and colonisation by E coli in asymptomatic periods as compared to those with no recurrent UTIs
- Mutations in host innate immunity like TLR and IL-8 receptor
## Microbe factors
- E coli which cause infection in normal hosts have strong virulence factors
- Adhesins like P fimbriae which react with receptor on renal epithelial cell (P means bind to blood group antigen P containing D-galactose-D-galactose residue)
- Type 1 pilus (fimbria) present in all E coli strain but expressed by few-- bind to mannose on bladder cells
# Approach
## 1st step is define 
### Asymptomatic Bacteruria 
- considered only when the patient does not have local or systemic symptoms referable to the urinary tract 
- detected incidentally when a patient undergoes a screening urine culture for a reason unrelated to the genitourinary tract 
- fever, altered mental status, and leukocytosis in the setting of a positive urine culture are nonspecific and do not merit a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI unless other potential etiologies have been considered 
### Cystitis 
- dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. 
- Nocturia, hesitancy, suprapubic discomfort, and gross hematuria are often noted
- Unilateral back or flank pain suggest that the upper urinary tract is involved (inconsistent with uncomplicated cystitis.)
- Fever likewise suggests invasive infection beyond the bladder, involving kidney, prostate, or bloodstream
### Pyelonephritis 
- Mild present as low-grade fever with or without lower-back or costovertebral-angle pain, 
- severe manifest as high fever, rigors, nausea, vomiting, and flank and/or loin pain
- generally acute onset 
- cystitis features maybe absent 
- fever to distinguish vs cystitis 
- "picket fence" high spiking fever resolving over 72h 
- in T2DM may have obstructive uropathy due to papillary necrosis 
- Papillary necrosis also seen in 
	- obstrucion 
	- sickle cell 
	- analgesic nephropathy 
- B/L papillary necrosis may have rapid rise in serum creatinine 
- ***Emphysematous pyelonephritis*** is a particularly severe form of the disease that is associated with the production of gas in renal and perinephric tissues and occurs almost exclusively in diabetic patients 
- ***Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis*** occurs when chronic urinary obstruction (often by staghorn calculi), together with chronic infection, leads to suppurative destruction of renal tissue
- residual renal tissue frequently has a yellow color- ation, with infiltration by lipid-laden macrophages 
- complicated by intraparenchymal abscess formation; this development should be suspected when a patient has continued fever and/or bacteremia despite antibacterial therapy 
### Prostatitis 
- both infectious and noninfectious abnormalities of the prostate gland. 
- Infections can be acute or chronic, are almost always bacterial in nature, 
- Infection less common than the non-infectious entity chronic pelvic pain syndrome (formerly known as chronic prostatitis)
- Acute bacterial prostatitis presents as dysuria, frequency, and pain in the prostatic pelvic or perineal area 
- fever, chills ++, symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction maybe present 
- chronic bacterial prostatitis insidiously as recurrent episodes of cystitis, sometimes with associated pelvic and perineal pain 
### Complicated UTI 
- systematic illness with an infectious focus in the urinary tract and frequently occurs in patients with an anatomic predisposition to infection, such as a foreign body in the urinary tract, or with factors predisposing to a delayed response to therapy 
## Diagnostic 
### History 
- high predictive value 
- women presenting with at least one symptom of UTI (dysuria, frequency, hematuria, or back pain) and without complicating factors, the probability of acute cystitis or pyelonephritis is 50% 
- If vaginal discharge and complicating factors are absent and risk factors for UTI are present, then the probability of UTI is close to 90%, and no laboratory evaluation is needed 
- combination of dysuria and urinary frequency in the absence of vaginal discharge increases the probability of UTI to 96% 
- dipstick or urine culture is not necessary in such patients before the initiation of definitive therapy 
- the meta-analysis cited above did not enroll children, adolescents, pregnant women, men, or patients with complicated UTI.
- One significant concern is that sexually transmitted disease—that caused by Chlamydia trachomatis in particular—may be inappropriately treated as UTI 
- Differentials of dysuria in young women
	- Cervicitis (C. trachomatis , Neisseria gonorhoeae)
	- Vaginitis ( Candida, Trichomonas vaginalis) 
	- herpetic urethritis 
	- interstitial cystitis 
	- non-infectious vaginal or vulvar irritation 
### Dipstick , Urinalysis, Culture 
- point of care tests 
- Enterobacteriacae only can convert nitrate to nitrite but with frequent voiding like in UTI, maybe negative as well 
- leukocyte esterase tests for PMNLs both intact and lysed 
- Either nitrate or leukocyte esterase positive can be taken as UTI 
- Even blood in urine maybe UTI
- Negative dipstick not sufficient to rule out bacteruria in pregnancy
- Microscopy
    - pyuria in almost all cystitis
    - Hematuria in 30% 
    - Nowadays auto analysers used which classify by size shape contrast light scattering and volume
    - Automatic system may give wrong bacterial counts but correct WBC RBC count
    - Signs and symptoms more important than analysis
- Culture
    - confirmation but need 24 hours 
    - Maybe cystitis or ASB 
    - 10^2 bacteria/ml is UTI in women 
    - 10^3/ml in men is UTI 
    - Maybe contaminated by distal urethra, skin, vagina especially if left at room temperature so must be cooled 
    - If mixed bacteria usually means contaminated except in catheter, chronic retention, fistula in urinary and gi or genital tract 
# Diagnostic approach
## Uncomplicated cystitis in women
- base of history alone 
- Urine dipstick if no reliable history or nonspecific symptoms
- Nitrite or leukocyte esterase positive with symptoms can give empirical therapy
- If negative dipstick then culture, close follow up and pelvic exam recommended
- Culture in 
    - pregnant
    - Bacterial resistance suspicion
    - Recurrent UTI
## Cystitis in men 
- collect culture if symptoms of UTI
- Bacteruria to differentiate acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis from chronic pelvic pain syndrome (not associated with bacteruria)
- Febrile UTI may have high PSA, enlarged prostate and seminal vesicles -- suggesting prostatic involvement
- Urinary retention, early recurrent UTIs and hematuria suggest surgically correctible disorders
- 1st febrile UTI should have USG or CT done 
- Refer to urologist if unclear diagnosis or recurrent UTI
## Asymptomatic bacteruria

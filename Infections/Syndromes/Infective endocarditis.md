- Vegetation is prototype lesion made of ***platelets, fibrin, microorganisms, scant inflammatory cells***
 - Most commonly in heart valves but may involve lower pressure side of VSD, intracardiac devices, mural endocardium damaged by jets of blood or foreign body
- If similar process in AV, AA shunts or coarctation of aorta aka **Infective Endarteritis** 
- Acute IE is rapid damage to cardiac structure, involves extracardiac sites and death if untreated in weeks 
- Subacute is indolent course 
- Predisposing
    - congenital heart defects
    - Chronic rheumatic heart disease
    - Injection drug abuse 
    - Degenerative valve disease 
    - Intracardiac devices 
        - 1st year high risk for valves 
        - Bioprosthetic higher risk than mechanical
# Etiology
- staphylococcus aureus most common
- Oral, skin, upper respiratory tract source of viridans streptococci, staphylococcus, HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae)
- Streptococcus gallolyticus from GI tract and associated with polyp and tumours in colon 
- Enterococci from GU tract
- Healthcare onset mostly by S. aureus, CoNS, Enterococci
- Prosthetic valve endocarditis
    - in 2 months -- early, nosocomial, S aures, CoNS , G negative bacilli, diphtheria, fungus
    - >12 months are like community acquired
    - TAVR-PVE (transcatheter implanted aortic valve )have more Enterococci
    - CIED-IE (Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices) involve device or endothelium at point of contact while some have concurrent aortic or mitral involvement max with S aureus or CoNS 
- IV drug users 
    - tricuspid valve by S aureus (methicillin resistance) 
    - Left sided have varied etiology
    - Enterobacterales , Pseudomonas, Candida, unusual organisms like bacillus, lactobacillus, Corynebacterium
- Culture negative
    - 5-15% negative culture
    - 1/3-1/2 of negative culture due to prior antibiotic exposure
    - Others by fastidious organism like some streptococci, nutritionally variant bacteria like Granulicatella & Abootrophia , HACEK, Coxiella burnetti, Bartonella
    - Tropheryma whipplei causes indolent culture negative IE 
    - Coxiella burnetti in prosthetic valve
    - Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium involve intracardiac devices
    - Mycobacterium chimaera causes prosthetic valve endocarditis
    - Atrial myxoma, marantic endocarditis, APLA may mimic culture negative IE
# Pathogenesis 
- undamaged epithelium resistant to infection by most bacteria
- Endothelial injury 
    - direct infection or
    - Platelet-fibrin thrombus aka ***NBTE (nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis)***
        - NBTE acts as site of bacterial attachment during transient bacteremia
        - NBTE seen in MR, AS, AR, VSD, Complex CHD 
        - Also seen in hypercoagulable states -- ***marantic endocarditis (uninfected vegetation in malignancy or chronic disease)***  
        - Bland vegetation complicating SLE and APLA 
- Colonisation
    - body surface or sites of infection are source of organisms
# Clinical
- variable course 
- Depends on causative agent
- Acute -- high grade fever >103-104 
    - beta hemolytic streptococcus
    - S aureus
    - Pneumococcal
    - Staphylococcus lugdunensis (CoNS)
    - Enterococci
- Subacute -- low grade fever <103 
    - S aureus sometime
    - Viridans streptococci
    - Enterococci 
    - CoNS 
    - HACEK 
- Indolent by Bartonella, T whipplei, Coxiella burnetti, M chimaera 
## Cardiac Manifestation
- murmurs usually reflect underlying predisposing cardiac pathology
- Valvular damage and rupture of chordae may cause new regurgitation murmurs
- 85% have murmurs
- CHF (due to valve dysfunction or intracardiac fistulae) in 30-40% 
- Extension of leaflet infection into annular or myocardium may cause intracardiac fistulae
- **Aortic paravalvular infection may extend to upper ventricular septum -- interrupt conducting system -- heart block** 
- Mitral paravalvular abcess rarely causes 
- Coronary artery emboli leading to MI in 2% 
## Non cardiac manifestation
- Non suppurative like Janeway lesions in subacute are related to prolonged infection have reduced due to antibiotic therapy
- Septic embolization related more common in acute 
    - subungual hemorrhage
    - Oslers node 
- Musculoskeletal pain usually resolves (differential is metastatic infection like Spondylodiscitis in 10-15%)
- Hematogenous spread to
    - skin 
    - Spleen 
    - Kidney 
    - Skeletal system
    - Meninges 
- Arterial emboli in 50% (usually 50% of these seen before diagnosis also) causes 
    - regional pain 
    - Ischemic damage to kidney, spleen, bowel, extremity 
    - Cerebrovascular emboli as stroke or encephalopathy in 15-35% and asymptomatic in upto 30-60% (left sided IE)
- Embolization risk 
    - staphylococcus aureus
    - Vegetation>10mm 
    - Infection of anterior leaflet of mitral valve
- Neurological sequelae
    - aseptic or purulent meningitis
    - ICH due to hemorrhagic infarct or ***mycotic aneurysm rupture (focal dilatation of arteries at point of weakness due to infection of Vasa vasorum or emboli)***
    - Microabcess
- ***Hypocomplimentemic glomerulonephritis*** due to immune complex deposition on glomerular basement membrane
## Specific manifestation
- septic pulmonary emboli
    - tricuspid IE 
    - Cough, pleuritic chest pain, nodular pulmonary infiltrate 
    - Occasionally empyema or pneumothorax
- Tricuspid IE rarely has peripheral manifestation
- Aortic valve or mitral valve IE has typical features with peripheral manifestation
- Healthcare associated IE has typical features unless 
    - intracardiac devices
    - Masked by concurrent illness
- CIED-E associated with
    - obvious (<6 months) or cryptic generator pocket infection 
    - Bacteremic seeding without pocket infection
-

- Vegetation is prototype lesion made of ***platelets, fibrin, microorganisms, scant inflammatory cells***
- Most commonly in heart valves but may involve lower pressure side of VSD, intracardiac devices, mural endocardium damaged by jets of blood or foreign body
- If similar process in AV, AA shunts or coarctation of aorta aka **Infective Endarteritis** 
- Acute IE is rapid damage to cardiac structure, involves extracardiac sites and death if untreated in weeks 
- Subacute is indolent course 
- Predisposing
    - congenital heart defects
    - Chronic rheumatic heart disease
    - Injection drug abuse 
    - Degenerative valve disease 
    - Intracardiac devices 
        - 1st year high risk for valves 
        - Bioprosthetic higher risk than mechanical
# Etiology
- staphylococcus aureus most common
- Oral, skin, upper respiratory tract source of viridans streptococci, staphylococcus, HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae)
- Streptococcus gallolyticus from GI tract and associated with polyp and tumours

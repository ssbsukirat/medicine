- Vegetation is prototype lesion made of ***platelets, fibrin, microorganisms, scant inflammatory cells***
- Most commonly in heart valves but may involve lower pressure side of VSD, intracardiac devices, mural endocardium damaged by jets of blood or foreign body
- If similar process in AV, AA shunts or coarctation of aorta aka **Infective Endarteritis** 
- Acute IE is rapid damage to cardiac structure, involves extracardiac sites and death if untreated in weeks 
- Subacute is indolent course 
- Predisposing
    - congenital heart defects
    - Chronic rheumatic heart disease
    - Injection drug abuse 
    - Degenerative valve disease 
    - Intracardiac devices 
        - 1st year high risk for valves 
        - Bioprosthetic higher risk than mechanical
# Etiology
- staphylococcus aureus most common
- Oral, skin, upper respiratory tract source of viridans streptococci, staphylococcus, HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae)
- Streptococcus gallolyticus from GI tract and associated with polyp and tumours in colon 
- Enterococci from GU tract
- Healthcare onset mostly by S. aureus, CoNS, Enterococci
- Prosthetic valve endocarditis
    - in 2 months -- early, nosocomial, S aures, CoNS , G negative bacilli, diphtheria, fungus
    - >12 months are like community acquired
    - TAVR-PVE (transcatheter implanted aortic valve )have more Enterococci
    - CIED-IE (Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices) involve device or endothelium at point of contact while some have concurrent aortic or mitral involvement max with S aureus or CoNS 
- IV drug users 
    - tricuspid valve by S aureus (methicillin resistance) 
    - Left sided have varied etiology
    - Enterobacterales , Pseudomonas, Candida, unusual organisms like bacillus, lactobacillus, Corynebacterium
- Culture negative
    - 5-15% negative culture
    - 1/3-1/2 of negative culture due to prior antibiotic exposure
    - Others by fastidious organism like some streptococci, nutritionally variant bacteria like Granulicatella & Abootrophia , HACEK, Coxiella burnetti, Bartonella
    - Tropheryma whipplei causes indolent culture negative IE 
    - Coxiella burnetti in prosthetic valve
    - Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium involve intracardiac devices
    - Mycobacterium chimaera causes prosthetic valve endocarditis
    - Atrial myxoma, marantic endocarditis, APLA may mimic culture negative IE
# Pathogenesis 
- undamaged epithelium resistant to infection by most bacteria
- Endothelial injury 
    - direct infection or
    - Platelet-fibrin thrombus aka ***NBTE (nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis)***
    - NBTE acts as site of bacterial attachment during transient bacteremia
    - NBTE seen in MR, AS, AR, VSD, Complex CHD

# Bacterial 
- Acute purulent infection in the Subarachnoid space 
- CNS inflammatory reaction resulting  in reduced consciousness , seizure , ICP stroke 
- Strep pneumonia > Neisseria meningitidis > gp B strep > Listeria > Haemophilus (<10%) 
## ETIOLOGY 
- S. pneumoniae 
	- mc in adults>20  (>50% cases) 
	- increased risk 
		- pneumococcal pneumonia 
		- acute or chronic pneumococcal sinusitis or otitis media, 
		- alcoholism, 
		- diabetes, 
		- splenectomy,
		- hypogammaglobulinemia, 
		- complement deficiency, 
		- head trauma with basilar skull fracture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea
- N. meningitidis 
	- reduced incidence due to quadrivalent vaccine (A,C,W-135, Y) 
	- does not contain B serogroup -- 1/3 cases of meningococcoal 
	- 16-23 age to be vaccinated with gp B (4MCMenB, MenB-FHbp) -- 
	- Neither group B vaccine reduces the risk of bacterial spread from vaccinated persons to unimmunized persons (vaccines do not significantly reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci, which is major source of person-to-person bacterial transmission)
	- purpuric, petechial skin lesions + 
	- fulminant --death within hours 
	- complement deficiency --> higher risk 
- Gram negative 
	- chronic & debilitating diseases 
		- diabetes 
		- cirrhosis 
		- alcoholism 
		- UTIs 
	- as complication of neurosurgical procedure (craniotomy especially ) 
- otitis, mastoiditis, sinusitis --> Streptococci , gram negative anaerobes , Staphylococcus , Haemophilus , Enterobacteriacae 
- in endocarditis --> viridans , S aures , Streptococci bovis, HACEK (Haemophilus spp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae), enterococci 
- Listeria 
	- neonates, pregnant comen, age>60 , immunocompromised 
	- food borne transmission 
	- coleslaw, milk, soft cheese, deli meat, uncooked hotdogs 
- H. influenzae causes meningitis in unvaccinated children and older adults, and non-b H. influenzae is an emerging pathogen 
- Staphylococcus aureus and CoNS post neurosurgical procedure 
## Pathophysiology 
- Initially colonise nasopharynx --> transported across epithelial cells in membran-bound vacoules or by invading intravascular space by separations in apical tight junction 
- avoid phagocytosis d/t polysaccharide capsule 
- bloodborne --> intraventricular choroid plexus --> epithelial cells --> CSF
- CSF has little defence --> few WBCs, low complement , IGs (prevent opsonisation) 
- Inflammatory 
	- neurological manifestation and complication due to inflammatory process 
	- Lysis of bacteria --> cell wall component released in SAS (LPS, teichoic acid, peptidoglycan )--> meningeal inflammation 
	- tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) are present in CSF within 1–2 h of intracisternal inoculation of LPS 
	- cytokine response --> CSF protein increase 
	- production of excitatory amino acids, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (free oxygen radicals, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite), and other mediators that can induce death of brain cells, especially in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
- ![[meningitisPATHO.png]]
- subarachnoid exudate of proteinaceous material and leukocytes obstructs the flow of CSF through the ventricular system and diminishes the resorptive capacity of the arachnoid granulations in the dural sinuses, leading to **obstructive and communicating hydrocephalus and concomitant interstitial edema** 
- adherence of leukocytes to capillary endothelial cells increases the permeability of blood vessels, allowing for the leakage of plasma proteins into the CSF, which adds to the inflammatory exudate 
- Neutrophil degranulation --> toxic metabolites that contribute to cytotoxic edema, cell injury, and death
- early --> increased cerebral blood flow --> reduced --> loss of autoregulation 
- combination of interstitial, vasogenic, and cytotoxic edema leads to raised ICP and coma 
## Clinical 
- acute or fulminant in few hours or subacute over several days 
- **fever , headache , nuchal rigidity** 
- decreased consciousness in >75% 
- nausea , vomiting , photophobia 
- Nuchal Rigidity 
	- neck Stiffness -- neck resists passive flexion.
	- pathognomic sign of meningeal irritation 
	- Kernig’s 
		- supine --> flex thigh on abdomen + flex knee --> attempt to passive extend knee --> pain
	- Brudzinski’s 
		- supine --> passive neck flex --> spontaneous flex hip and knee 
- Seizures -- 15-40% 
	- focal d/t focal arterial ischemia or infarct , CVT with hemorrhage , focal edema 
	- GTCS or status --> hyponatremia, cerebral anoxia, antimicrobial toxicity 
- Raised ICP 
	- major cause of obtundation and coma 
	- 90% have >180mm, 20% >400mmH20 
	- reduced level of consciousness, papilledema, dilated poorly reactive pupils, sixth nerve palsies, decerebrate posturing, and the Cushing reflex (bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular respirations) 
	- most disastrous complication --> cerebral herniation 1-8%  
- specific clues 
	- rash of meningococcemia, 
		- begins as a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash resembling a viral exanthem; 
		- skin lesions of meningococcemia rapidly become petechial. 
		- Petechiae are found on the trunk and lower extremities, in the mucous membranes and conjunctiva, and occasionally on the palms and soles
## Diagnosis 
- blood culture + empirical antimicrobial + dexamethasone 
- CSF 
	- if immunocompetent + no head trauma , normal consciousness , no papilledema or FNDs --> CSF without neuroimaging 
	- otherwise after neuroimaging 
	- if waiting for CSF --> start therapy as picture not affected in few hours 
	- ![[MeningitisCSF.png]]
	- PMN leucocytosis >100 in 90% 
	- low glucose <40 +/- CSF/serum RBS <0.4 
		- low is CSF/serum <0.6 , <0.4 is highly suggestive 
		- serum to CSF RBS equilibrium can take 30mins so safe to give 50ml of D50 if needed 
	- increased protein -- >0.45/>45 mg/dl in 90% 
	- increased opening pressure >180mmH2O 
	- positive CSF culture + in >70% , positive g stain in >60% 
	- PCR assays 
		- S pneumoniae 
		- N meningitidis 
		- E Coli 
		- L monocytogenes 
		- H influenzae 
		- S agalactaciae 
- neuroimaging 
	- MRI > CT -- areas of edema and ischemia 
	- bacterial meningitis, diffuse meningeal enhancement is often seen after the administration of gadolinium. 
		- not diagnostic but seen in any disease with high BBB permeability 
- biopsy of petechial skin lesions 
## DIFFERENTIAL 
- Viral (HSV) meningoencephalitis 
	- headache fever altered consciousness 
	- FND 
	- focal or general seizures 
	- CSF , imaging and EEG to differentiate (CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis )
	- FLAIR, T2 high-signal-intensity lesions are seen in the orbitofrontal, anterior, and medial temporal lobes in the majority of patients within 48 h of symptom onset
- Rickettsial 
	- Rocky mountain spotted fever -- Rickettsia rickettsi 
		- acutely with high fever, prostration, myalgia, headache, nausea, and vomiting 
		- rash -- diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash that may be difficult to distinguish from that of meningococcemia. It progresses to a petechial rash, then to a purpuric rash, and if untreated, to skin necrosis or gangrene 
		- diagnosis -- immunofluorescent staining of skin biopsy specimens. 
	- Ehrlichioses 
		- tick bite transmission 
		- gram negative coccobacilli 
		- Anaplasma phagocytophilum -- human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (anaplasmosis) 
		- Ehrlichia chaffeensis --> human monocytic ehrlichiosis
		- fever, headache, confusion, nausea, and vomiting 
		- 20% have maculopapular or petechial rash 
		- leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, and mild to moderate elevations in alanine aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase 
		- altered level of consciousness ranging from mild lethargy to coma, confusion, focal neurologic signs, cranial nerve palsies, hyperreflexia, and seizures 
- Focal CNS infection 
	- subdural or epidural empyema , brain abcess 
	- MRI in meningitis with focal features 
- Noninfectious CNS 
	- SAH 
	- Medication induced hypersensitivity meningitis 
	- chemical meningitis d/t tumour content rupture into CSF 
	- Carcinomatous or lymphomatous meningitis 
	- Sarcoid, SLE, Behcets , pituitary apoplexy associated meningitis 
	- uveomeningitic syndromes (Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome) 
## TREATMENT 
- medical emergency 
- start therapy in 60 min of arrival -- before CSF reports available 
- Empirical 
	- suspected bacterial meningitis in children and adults --> combination of **dexamethasone, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or cefepime), and vancomycin,** 
	- plus **acyclovir**, as HSV encephalitis is the leading disease in the differential diagnosis, 
	- **Doxycycline** during tick season to treat tick-borne bacterial infections
- **Ceftriaxone or cefotaxime** --> susceptible S. pneumoniae, group B streptococci, and H. influenzae and adequate for N. meningitidis 
- **Cefepime** is a broad-spectrum fourth-generation cephalosporin with in vitro activity similar to that of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone against S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis and greater activity against Enterobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- Cefepime has been associated with seizures, myoclonus, and encephalopathy, any of which may limit its use in critically ill patients 
- **Ampicillin** --> Listeria coverage in <3m, >55 years or those with impaired cell mediated immunity (chronic disease , pregnancy , organ transplant , malignancy , immunosuppression )
- **Metronidazole** --> cover gram-negative anaerobes in patients with otitis, sinusitis, or mastoiditis 
- Hospital acquired or post neurosurgical 
	- staphylococcus , pseudomonas 
	- combination of **vancomycin and ceftazidime or meropenem**
- Ceftazidime or Meropenem in neutropenia for pseudomonas 
- Meropenem also has activity against Listeria, Pseudomonas , penicillin-resistant pneumococci 
- Pneumococci --> meropenem better than ceftriaxone but worse than vancomycin 
- Meropenem dont use as monotherapy 
- ![[MeningitisTREATMENT.png]]
### Meningococcal 
- penicllin G DOC 
- test CSF isolates for penicillin and ampicillin susceptiblity 
- 7-day course of intravenous antibiotic therapy is adequate for uncomplicated
- Index case and all close contacts --> chemoprophylaxis with a **2-day regimen of rifampin (600 mg every 12 h for 2 days in adults and 10 mg/kg every 12 h for 2 days in children >1 year).** (not in pregnancy )
- adults alternate chemoprophylaxis -- one dose of azithromycin (500 mg) or one intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone (250 mg)
- close contacts -- contact with oropharyngeal secretion by kissing, toys or beverage or cigarette 
### Pneumococci 
- Cephalosporin + Vancomycin 
- susceptible to penicillin with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) <0.06 μg/mL and to be resistant when the MIC is >0.12 μg/mL 
- cefotaxime or ceftriaxone MICs ≤0.5 μg/mL, treatment with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is usually adequate. For MIC >1 μg/mL, vancomycin is the antibiotic of choice 
- Rifampin (can be ADDED to vancomycin ) but unsuitable for monotherapy 
- 2-week IV antibiotic for pneumococcal 
- Repeat CSF 
	- repeat LP performed 24–36 h after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy to document sterilization of the CSF. 
	- Failure to sterilize the CSF after 24–36 h of antibiotic therapy should be considered presumptive evidence of antibiotic resistance.
- If fail with iV vancomycin -- add **intraventricular Vancomycin** 
- intraventricular route of administration is preferred over the intrathecal route because adequate concentrations of vancomycin in the cerebral ventricles are not always achieved with intrathecal administration 
### Listeria 
- Ampicillin for 3 weeks 
- Gentamicin in critically ill --2mg/kg loading f/b 7.5mg/kg/day Q8H 
- Trimethoprim 10-20mg/kg/day Sulfamethoxazole 50-100mg/kg/day Q6H in penicillin allergy 
### Staphylococcus 
- Nafcillin 
- MRSA / penicillin allergy - Vancomycin 
- 48h CSF not sterile -- intraventricular / intrathecal vancomycin 20mg OD 
### Gram-negative Bacillary Meningitis 
- 3rd generation cephalosporin -- cefotaxime , ceftriaxone , ceftazidime 
- if pseudomonas -- ceftazidime or meropenem  
- 3 week IV antibiotic 
## Adjunctive 
- Dexamethasone 
	- **20 min before antibiotic** (only inhibits TNF-a by macrophage & microglia if given before their activation )
	- inhibiting the synthesis of IL-1β and TNF-α at the level of mRNA, 
	- decreasing CSF outflow resistance,
	- stabilizing the blood-brain barrier.
	- best benefit in pneumococcal 
	- 10mg IV Q6H for 4 days 
	- may reduce Vancomycin entry to CSF -- > give 45-60mg/kg/day or intraventricular 
	- reduces complication rates 
	- patients in sub-Saharan Africa and those in low-income countries with negative CSF Gram’s stain and culture should not be treated with dexamethasone. 
- raised ICP 
	- elevation to 30-45 degree 
	- intubation and hyperventilation (pco2 25-30mmhg) 
	- ICP monitoring device in ICU 
## Prognosis 
- risk of death more in 
	- decreased GCS on admission 
	- seizure within 24h of admission 
	- raised ICP 
	- young age 
	- age >50 
	- shock or need for mechanical ventilation 
- sequelae 
	- decreased intellectual function, 
	- memory impairment, 
	- seizures,
	- hearing loss and dizziness, and 
	- gait disturbances

	- >1000 cells in ***lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and mumps*** 
	- PMN predominant rarely in 1st 48h especially WNV, echovirus 9, eastern equine encephalitis virus or mumps 
	- PMN with low glucose in CMV in immunocompromised 
	- if PMN - consider bacterial or parameningeal infection 
	- Lymphocytic + low glucose considere Fungal or TB or listeria or noninfectious 
	- some viral may have low glucose echovirus , enterovirus , HSV-2, VZV 
- PCR 
	- Enteroviral and HSV -- diagnostic of choice and more sensitive than culture 
	- in recurrent "asceptic" meningitis -- HSV DNA PCR + despite negative culture 
	- CMV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), VZV, and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) 
	- WNV PCR available but are not as sensitive as detection of WNV-specific CSF IgM 
	- Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which can mimic viral meningitis and encephalitis 
	- PCR of throat washings may assist in diagnosis of enteroviral and mycoplasmal CNS infections. 
	- PCR of stool specimens may also assist in diagnosis of enteroviral infections
- Viral Culture 
	- sensitivity poor 
	- also be isolated from throat swabs, stool, blood, and urine. 
	- Enteroviruses (not diagnostic) and adenoviruses may be found in feces; 
	- arboviruses, some enteroviruses, and LCMV in blood; 
	- mumps and CMV in urine; and

	- supportive TREATMENT 
- Arbovirus 
	- summer and fall 
	- WNV, St louis encephalitis , California Encephalitis

- HSV 
	- 2nd MC 
	- uncomplicated meningitis -- HSV-2 
	- Encephalitis --> HSV-1 
	- HSV CSF RTPCR 
	- Demonstration of intrathecal synthesis of HSV- specific antibody may also be useful in diagnosis 
	- Most cases of recurrent viral or “aseptic” meningitis, including cases previously diagnosed as Mollaret’s meningitis, are due to HSV. 
- VZV 
	- if concurrent chickenpox or shingles 
	- may have encephalitis or meningitis  without rash also 
	- CSF PCR 
	- demonstration of VZV-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis and/or the presence of VZV CSF IgM antibodies, or by positive CSF cultures.
- EBV 
	- +/- associated infectious mononucleosis 
	- atypical lymphocytosis in CSF or PBF s/o EBV

	- F/B oral drug such as acyclovir (800 mg five times daily), famciclovir (500 mg tid), or valacyclovir (1000 mg tid) for a total course of 7–14 days 
- less sick oral only 
- HIV meningitis --> HAART 
- Deficient humoral immunity (X linked aggamaglobulinemia) + not receiving IM gamma globulin or IVIg --> give 1 of these

- Vaccine to prevent 
# Subacute 
## Clinical 
- unrelenting headache , stiff neck, low-grade fever and lethargy for days to weeks 
- Cranial nerve palsy and night sweats 
## Etiology 
- TB, Cryptococcus neoformans, H capsulatum, C immitis, T pallidum 
- TB meningitis not from hematogenous spread 
	- millet seed–sized (**miliary**) tubercles form in the parenchyma of the brain during hematogenous dissemination of tubercle bacilli in the course of primary infection --> enlarge and caseate 
	- meningitis by caseating lesion if close to SAS and high rate of fibrous encapsulation 
	- Subependymal caseous foci cause meningitis via discharge of bacilli and tuberculous antigens into the SAS 
	- intense inflammatory reaction that leads to the production of a thick exudate that fills the basilar cisterns and surrounds the cranial nerves and major blood vessels at the base of the brain. 
- Fungal 
	- inhalation of airborne spores 
	- asymptomatic or fever, cough, sputum , chest pain -- self-limited pulmonary infection 
	- dormant pulmonary infection --> cell mediated immunity abnormal --> reactivation and CNS dissemination

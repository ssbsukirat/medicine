# Bacterial 
- Acute purulent infection in the Subarachnoid space 
- CNS inflammatory reaction resulting  in reduced consciousness , seizure , ICP stroke 
- Strep pneumonia > Neisseria meningitidis > gp B strep > Listeria > Haemophilus (<10%) 
## ETIOLOGY 
- S. pneumoniae 
	- mc in adults>20  (>50% cases) 
	- increased risk 
		- pneumococcal pneumonia 
		- acute or chronic pneumococcal sinusitis or otitis media, 
		- alcoholism, 
		- diabetes, 
		- splenectomy,
		- hypogammaglobulinemia, 
		- complement deficiency, 
		- head trauma with basilar skull fracture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea
- N. meningitidis 
	- reduced incidence due to quadrivalent vaccine (A,C,W-135, Y) 
	- does not contain B serogroup -- 1/3 cases of meningococcoal 
	- 16-23 age to be vaccinated with gp B (4MCMenB, MenB-FHbp) -- 
	- Neither group B vaccine reduces the risk of bacterial spread from vaccinated persons to unimmunized persons (vaccines do not significantly reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci, which is major source of person-to-person bacterial transmission)
	- purpuric, petechial skin lesions + 
	- fulminant --death within hours 
	- complement deficiency --> higher risk 
- Gram negative 
	- chronic & debilitating diseases 
		- diabetes 
		- cirrhosis 
		- alcoholism 
		- UTIs 
	- as complication of neurosurgical procedure (craniotomy especially ) 
- otitis, mastoiditis, sinusitis --> Streptococci , gram negative anaerobes , Staphylococcus , Haemophilus , Enterobacteriacae 
- in endocarditis --> viridans , S aures , Streptococci bovis, HACEK (Haemophilus spp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae), enterococci 
- Listeria 
	- neonates, pregnant comen, age>60 , immunocompromised 
	- food borne transmission 
	- coleslaw, milk, soft cheese, deli meat, uncooked hotdogs 
- H. influenzae causes meningitis in unvaccinated children and older adults, and non-b H. influenzae is an emerging pathogen 
- Staphylococcus aureus and CoNS post neurosurgical procedure 
## Pathophysiology 
- Initially colonise nasopharynx --> transported across epithelial cells in membran-bound vacoules or by invading intravascular space by separations in apical tight junction 
- avoid phagocytosis d/t polysaccharide capsule 
- bloodborne --> intraventricular choroid plexus --> epithelial cells --> CSF
- CSF has little defence --> few WBCs, low complement , IGs (prevent opsonisation) 
- Inflammatory 
	- neurological manifestation and complication due to inflammatory process 
	- Lysis of bacteria --> cell wall component released in SAS (LPS, teichoic acid, peptidoglycan )--> meningeal inflammation 
	- tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) are present in CSF within 1–2 h of intracisternal inoculation of LPS 
	- cytokine response --> CSF protein increase 
	- production of excitatory amino acids, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (free oxygen radicals, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite), and other mediators that can induce death of brain cells, especially in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

- subarachnoid exudate of proteinaceous material and leukocytes obstructs the flow of CSF through the ventricular system and diminishes the resorptive capacity of the arachnoid granulations in the dural sinuses, leading to **obstructive and communicating hydrocephalus and concomitant interstitial edema** 
- adherence of leukocytes to capillary endothelial cells increases the permeability of blood vessels, allowing for the leakage of plasma proteins into the CSF, which adds to the inflammatory exudate 
- Neutrophil degranulation --> toxic metabolites that contribute to cytotoxic edema, cell injury, and death
- early --> increased cerebral blood flow --> reduced --> loss of autoregulation 
- combination of interstitial, vasogenic, and cytotoxic edema leads to raised ICP and coma 
## Clinical 
- acute or fulminant in few hours or subacute over several days 
- **fever , headache , nuchal rigidity** 
- decreased consciousness in >75% 
- nausea , vomiting , photophobia 
- Nuchal Rigidity 
	- neck Stiffness -- neck resists passive flexion.
	- pathognomic sign of meningeal irritation 
	- Kernig’s 
		- supine --> flex thigh on abdomen + flex knee --> attempt to passive extend knee --> pain
	- Brudzinski’s 
		- supine --> passive neck flex --> spontaneous flex hip and knee 
- Seizures -- 15-40% 
	- focal d/t focal arterial ischemia or infarct

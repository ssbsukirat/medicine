- Encephalitis is defined as an inflammation of the brain caused either by infection, usually with a virus, or from a primary autoimmune process
- Many patients with encephalitis also have evidence of associated meningitis (meningoencephalitis) and, in some cases, involvement of the spinal cord or nerve roots (encephalomyelitis, encephalomyeloradiculitis) 
# Clinical 
- encephalitis is typically an acute febrile illness.
- commonly has an altered level of consciousness (confusion, behavioral abnormalities), or a depressed level of consciousness ranging from mild lethargy to coma, and evidence of either focal or diffuse neurologic signs and symptoms.
- may have hallucinations, agitation, personality change, behavioral disorders, and, at times, a frankly psychotic state. 
- Focal or generalized seizures occur in many patients
- the signs and symptoms reflect the sites of infection and inflammation 
- focal findings are aphasia, ataxia, upper or lower motor neuron patterns of weakness, involuntary movements (e.g., myoclonic jerks, tremor), and cranial nerve deficits (e.g., ocular palsies, facial weakness) 
- hypothalamic-pituitary axis may result in temperature dysregulation, diabetes insipidus, or the development of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) 
# Etiology 
- ![[encephalitisetiology.png]]
- HSV, VZV, EBV 
- Epidemics caused by arboviruses like
	- Alphaviruses (eastern equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya)
	- Flavivirus ( West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Powassan virus, Zika)
	- Bunyaviruses (California encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus, Jamestown Canyon virus)
- New causes 
	- Nipah virus in Southeast Asia 
	- Toscana virus in europe 
	- ZIka 
	- chikungunya 
	- Dengue 
	- Parechoviruses including human parechovirus 3 (HPeV3) 
# Laboratory Diagnosis 
## CSF 
- in all patients except contraindicated by raised ICP 
- 20ml ideally , store 5-10ml for future frozen 
- similar profile to meningitis (viral)
- ***lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein (mild), normal glucose***
- Pleocytosis (>5 cells/uL) in >95% patient but maybe missing in first sample but seen in subsequent LPs 
- Failure to mount response in 
	- severe immunocompromised by HIV 
	- glucocorticoid use or immunosuppresant drugs 
	- chemotherapy 
	- lymphoreticular malignancies 
- cells >500/ul in <10% 
- ***>1000 cells in EEE virus, california encephalitis virus, mumps and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)***
- ***Atypical lymphocytes in the CSF may be seen in EBV infection*** and less commonly with other viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), HSV, and enteroviruses 
- Increased numbers of plasmacytoid or Mollaret-like large mononuclear cells have been reported in WNV encephalitis 
- CSF PMNLs in 
	- EEE virus 
	- echovirus 9 
	- enterovirus 
- persistent CSF neutrophilia 
	- bacterial infections 
	- leptospira 
	- amebic 
	- noninfectious like acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis 
- 20% have RBCs without traumatic tap 
- decreased CSF glucose concentration is distinctly unusual in viral encephalitis and should suggest the possibility of
	- bacterial, 
	- fungal, 
	- tuberculous,
	- parasitic, 
	- leptospiral, 
	- syphilitic, 
	- sarcoid, or 
	- neoplastic meningitis 
- low CSF with mumps, LCMV, advance HSV encephalitis but all very rare 
## CSF for PCR 
- primary Diagnostic tool for HSV, CMV, EBV, HHV6 Enteroviruses
- VZV 
    - CSF PCR 
    - Detection of viral specific IgM 
    - Intrathecal antibody synthesis 
- Equivalent sensitivity and specificity for HSV as brain biopsy 
- Negative test reduces likelihood but does not exclude infection (needs to be done at qualified laboratory, appropriate time during illness, high likelihood of HSV encephalitis )
- Maybe negative <72h of onset and become positive later 
- Negative >14 days of onset 
- <7 days of antiviral therapy does not affect PCR report
- Other than HSV 
    - Enteroviruses PCR is >95 sensitivity and specificity
    - Parechoviruses may not be identified by Enterovirus PCR
    - EBV PCR positive is not clear as it maybe due to latent EBV infection in lymphocytes
    - VZV may have negative PCR but positive PCR so these have complimentary value only
    - In West Nile virus, CSF IgM better than PCR
    - In COVID, only true encephalitis have CSF PCR positive but infection related encephalopathy may have nasopharyngeal swab positive
## CSF culture
- limited utility of viral 
- Takes too long
- Not sensitive enough
## Serology and Antigen detection
- antibody detection less useful which have high seroprevalence in population like HSV, VZV, CMV EBV
- Low seroprevalence viruses can be demonstrated by seroconversion between acute and convalescent serum (2-4 weeks later) or virus specific IgM
- VZV and HSV maybe demonstrated by virus specific antibodies in CSF like high IgG index or IgM antibodies 
- Antibodies less useful in acute management as there is lag period
- HSV antigen and (glycoprotein antigens) antibodies are seen after 1 weeks which will delay diagnosis
- Antibody testing has value if >1 week illness and negative PCR
- WNV IgM in CSF is Diagnostic (max seropositive on day 7)
## MRI CT EEG 
- focal findings in encephalitis patient should raise concern for HSV encephalitis
    - areas of ***increased intensity*** in frontotemporal, cingulate or insular regions on T2, FLAIR, Diffusion weighted 
    - Focal areas of ***low absorption, mass effect and contrast enhancement*** on CT 
    - Periodic focal temporal lobe spikes on background of slow or low amplitude (flattened activity) on EEG 
    - 10% may have normal MRI
    - EEG typical is periodic, stereotypical sharp-and-slow complexes at 2-3s intervals (between days 2)

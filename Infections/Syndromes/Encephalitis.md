- Encephalitis is defined as an inflammation of the brain caused either by infection, usually with a virus, or from a primary autoimmune process
- Many patients with encephalitis also have evidence of associated meningitis (meningoencephalitis) and, in some cases, involvement of the spinal cord or nerve roots (encephalomyelitis, encephalomyeloradiculitis) 
# Clinical 
- encephalitis is typically an acute febrile illness.
- commonly has an altered level of consciousness (confusion, behavioral abnormalities), or a depressed level of consciousness ranging from mild lethargy to coma, and evidence of either focal or diffuse neurologic signs and symptoms.
- may have hallucinations, agitation, personality change, behavioral disorders, and, at times, a frankly psychotic state. 
- Focal or generalized seizures occur in many patients
- the signs and symptoms reflect the sites of infection and inflammation 
- focal findings are aphasia, ataxia, upper or lower motor neuron patterns of weakness, involuntary movements (e.g., myoclonic jerks, tremor), and cranial nerve deficits (e.g., ocular palsies, facial weakness) 
- hypothalamic-pituitary axis may result in temperature dysregulation, diabetes insipidus, or the development of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) 
# Etiology 
- ![[encephalitisetiology.png]]
- HSV, VZV, EBV 
- Epidemics caused by arboviruses like
	- Alphaviruses (eastern equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya)
	- Flavivirus ( West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Powassan virus, Zika)
	- Bunyaviruses (California encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus, Jamestown Canyon virus)
- New causes 
	- Nipah virus in Southeast Asia 
	- Toscana virus in europe 
	- ZIka 
	- chikungunya 
	- Dengue 
	- Parechoviruses including human parechovirus 3 (HPeV3) 
# Laboratory Diagnosis 
## CSF 
- in all patients except contraindicated by raised ICP 
- 20ml ideally , store 5-10ml for future frozen 
- similar profile to meningitis (viral)
- ***lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein (mild), normal glucose***
- Pleocytosis (>5 cells/uL) in >95% patient but maybe missing in first sample but seen in subsequent LPs 
- Failure to mount response in 
	- severe immunocompromised by HIV 
	- glucocorticoid use or immunosuppresant drugs 
	- chemotherapy 
	- lymphoreticular malignancies 
- cells >500/ul in <10% 
- ***>1000 cells in EEE virus, california encephalitis virus, mumps and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)***
- ***Atypical lymphocytes in the CSF may be seen in EBV infection*** and less commonly with other viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), HSV, and enteroviruses 
- Increased numbers of plasmacytoid or Mollaret-like large mononuclear cells have been reported in WNV encephalitis 
- CSF PMNLs in 
	- EEE virus 
	- echovirus 9 
	- enterovirus 
- persistent CSF neu

- Encephalitis is defined as an inflammation of the brain caused either by infection, usually with a virus, or from a primary autoimmune process
- Many patients with encephalitis also have evidence of associated meningitis (meningoencephalitis) and, in some cases, involvement of the spinal cord or nerve roots (encephalomyelitis, encephalomyeloradiculitis) 
# Clinical 
- encephalitis is typically an acute febrile illness.
- commonly has an altered level of consciousness (confusion, behavioral abnormalities), or a depressed level of consciousness ranging from mild lethargy to coma, and evidence of either focal or diffuse neurologic signs and symptoms.
- may have hallucinations, agitation, personality change, behavioral disorders, and, at times, a frankly psychotic state. 
- Focal or generalized seizures occur in many patients
- the signs and symptoms reflect the sites of infection and inflammation 
- focal findings are aphasia, ataxia, upper or lower motor neuron patterns of weakness, involuntary movements (e.g., myoclonic jerks, tremor), and cranial nerve deficits (e.g., ocular palsies, facial weakness) 
- hypothalamic-pituitary axis may result in temperature dysregulation, diabetes insipidus, or the development of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) 
# Etiology 
- ![[encephalitisetiology.png]]
- HSV, VZV, EBV 
- Epidemics caused by arboviruses like
	- Alphaviruses (eastern equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya)
	- Flavivirus ( West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Powassan virus, Zika)
	- Bunyaviruses (California encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus, Jamestown Canyon virus)
- New causes 
	- Nipah virus in Southeast Asia 
	- Toscana virus in europe 
	- ZIka 
	- chikungunya 
	- Dengue 
	- Parechoviruses including human parechovirus 3 (HPeV3) 
# Laboratory Diagnosis 
## CSF 
- in all patients except contraindicated by raised ICP 
- 20ml ideally , store 5-10ml for future frozen 
- similar profile to meningitis (viral)
- ***lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein (mild), normal glucose***
- Pleocytosis (>5 cells/uL) in >95% patient but maybe missing in first sample but seen in subsequent LPs 
- Failure to mount response in 
	- severe immunocompromised by HIV 
	- glucocorticoid use or immunosuppresant drugs 
	- chemotherapy 
	- lymphoreticular malignancies 
- cells >500/ul in <10% 
- ***>1000 cells in EEE virus, california encephalitis virus, mumps and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)***
- ***Atypical lymphocytes in the CSF may be seen in EBV infection*** and less commonly with other viruses, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), HSV, and enteroviruses 
- Increased numbers of plasmacytoid or Mollaret-like large mononuclear cells have been reported in WNV encephalitis 
- CSF PMNLs in 
	- EEE virus 
	- echovirus 9 
	- enterovirus 
- persistent CSF neutrophilia 
	- bacterial infections 
	- leptospira 
	- amebic 
	- noninfectious like acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis 
- 20% have RBCs without traumatic tap 
- decreased CSF glucose concentration is distinctly unusual in viral encephalitis and should suggest the possibility of
	- bacterial, 
	- fungal, 
	- tuberculous,
	- parasitic, 
	- leptospiral, 
	- syphilitic, 
	- sarcoid, or 
	- neoplastic meningitis 
- low CSF with mumps, LCMV, advance HSV encephalitis but all very rare 
## CSF for PCR 
- primary Diagnostic tool for HSV, CMV, EBV, HHV6 Enteroviruses
- VZV 
    - CSF PCR 
    - Detection of viral specific IgM 
    - Intrathecal antibody synthesis 
- Equivalent sensitivity and specificity for HSV as brain biopsy 
- Negative test reduces likelihood but does not exclude infection (needs to be done at qualified laboratory, appropriate time during illness, high likelihood of HSV encephalitis )
- Maybe negative <72h of onset and become positive later 
- Negative >14 days of onset 
- <7 days of antiviral therapy does not affect PCR report
- Other than HSV 
    - Enteroviruses PCR is >95 sensitivity and specificity
    - Parechoviruses may not be identified by Enterovirus PCR
    - EBV PCR positive is not clear as it maybe due to latent EBV infection in lymphocytes
    - VZV may have negative PCR but positive PCR so these have complimentary value only
    - In West Nile virus, CSF IgM better than PCR
    - In COVID, only true encephalitis have CSF PCR positive but infection related encephalopathy may have nasopharyngeal swab positive
## CSF culture
- limited utility of viral 
- Takes too long
- Not sensitive enough
## Serology and Antigen detection
- antibody detection less useful which have high seroprevalence in population like HSV, VZV, CMV EBV
- Low seroprevalence viruses can be demonstrated by seroconversion between acute and convalescent serum (2-4 weeks later) or virus specific IgM
- VZV and HSV maybe demonstrated by virus specific antibodies in CSF like high IgG index or IgM antibodies 
- Antibodies less useful in acute management as there is lag period
- HSV antigen and (glycoprotein antigens) antibodies are seen after 1 weeks which will delay diagnosis
- Antibody testing has value if >1 week illness and negative PCR
- WNV IgM in CSF is Diagnostic (max seropositive on day 7)
## MRI CT EEG 
- focal findings in encephalitis patient should raise concern for HSV encephalitis
    - areas of ***increased intensity*** in frontotemporal, cingulate or insular regions on T2, FLAIR, Diffusion weighted 
    - Focal areas of ***low absorption, mass effect and contrast enhancement*** on CT 
    - Periodic focal temporal lobe spikes on background of slow or low amplitude (flattened activity) on EEG 
    - 10% may have normal MRI
    - EEG typical is periodic, stereotypical sharp-and-slow complexes at 2-3s intervals (between days 2-15 of illness)
- WNV encephalitis has MRI abnormalities in 2/3 
    - deeper brain structures and not cortex usually
    - Like thalamus, basal ganglia, brainstem 
    - Apparent on FLAIR imaging only 
    - Similar pattern in arbovirus like JE virus, St Louis virus, alphavirus
    - EEG shows generalised slowing which is anterior predominant 
- VZV encephalitis
    - multifocal areas of hemorrhagic and ischemic infarct
    - Reflects tendency to produce CNS vasculopathy and not true encephalitis
- CMV encephalitis in immunocompromised have enlarged ventricles with areas of increased T2 on MRI outlining the ventricles and subependymal enhancement on T1 post contrast 
- Cerebellar T2/FLAIR abnormalities in Powassan virus, and EBV, VZV in children..
## Brain Biopsy
- only if 
    - CSF PCR negative
    - Focal abnormalities on MRI
    - No serological evidence of autoimmune disease 
    - Progressive clinical deterioration despite acyclovir and supportive therapy
# Differential diagnosis
- mimics like 
    - TB (Mycobacterium)
    - Fungal 
    - Rickettsiae
    - Listeria 
    - Mycoplasma
    - Bartonella
    - Neurosyphilis
- Antibodies (present in serum or CSF)
    - NMDA receptor (in 25% patients with HSV also so should treat for viral also)
    - VGKC/LGI-1 (voltage gated potassium channel/leucine rich glioma inactivated protein 1 )
    - AMPA 
    - GABA 
    - GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase)
    - Maybe paraneoplastic 
    - Onconeural antibodies (anti-hu, Yo, Ma2, amphiphysin, CRMP5, CV2)
    - Thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase (Hashimotos encephalopathy), prion disease may produce subacute or chronic encephalitis
- Naegleria fowleri (primary amebic meningoencephalitis), 
    - warm iron rich water sources 
    - drains, canals, natural or man-made pools
    - Immunocompetent children swimming in infected waters 
    - CSF similar to bacterial meningitis with neutrophilic pleocytosis and hypoglycorrhachia 
    - Motile trophozoites on wet mount of fresh warm CSF
- ***Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia*** -- subacute or chronic granulomatous amebic meningoencephalitis
- Baylisascaris procyonis (raccoon pinworm)
    - history of raccoon exposure
    - Eating dirt or playing with dirt contaminated with raccoon feces 
    - Children
    - Eosinophils ++ 
- after excluding non viral, differentiate ***HSV vs other viruses***
    - HSV therapy is available whereas others give supportive therapy
    - Suspect HSV if inferomedial frontotemporal regions of brain involved
    - Prominent gustatory or olfactory hallucinations, anosmia 
    - Unusual or bizarre behaviour or personality alterations 
    - Memory disturbance all suggest hsv 
- Rapidly progressive and prominent brainstem signs or neuroimaging abnormal
    - flavivirus (WNV, St Louis, JE) -- so deep gray matter structure involvement like basal ganglia or thalamus
    - HSV 
    - Enteroviruses A71 
    - Rabies 
    - Listeria monocytogenes
- Poliomyelitis like AFM -- 
    - WNV, EV-A71, EV-D68 
    - Acute onset LMN type weakness with flaccid tone and reduced or absent reflexes 
    - Preserved sensation relatively
    - Multisegmental increase FLAIR and T2 in anterior horn cells with CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis
- RABIES encephalitis
    - fever, fluctuating consciousness and autonomic hyperactivity
    - Phobic spasms of larynx, pharynx, neck muscles and diaphragm -- hydrophobia, aerophobia 
    - ***Dumb rabies*** -- paralytic rabies with acute ascending paralysis
    - Bat bite rabies has focal deficit, myoclonus, seizures, hallucinations without phobic spasms
    - CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis
    - Increased T2 signal abnormal in brainstem, hippocampus, hypothalamus
    - rabies virus antigen detection in brain tissue or hair follicles at nape of neck 
    - PCR amplification of CSF, saliva or tears 
    - Serology negative in 1st week 
    - No specific therapy
    - Almost always fatal 
    - Survivors have devastating neurological sequelae

# treatment
- specific therapy when appropriate
- Monitor vitals and support as required 
- Initially most will need icu care 
- ICP monitor
- Fluid restriction
- Avoid hypotonic solutions
- Suppress fever 
- Treat seizures as they occur (prophylaxis maybe considered)
- Acyclovir
    - start empirically of viral encephalitis suspected especially if focal seizures
    - Discontinue of HSV absent except VZV or EBV  
    - Deoxypyrimidine (thymidine) kinase enzyme in HSV, EBV, CMV phosphorylates acyclovir to acyclovir-5-monophosphate which is further converted to triphosphate derivative
    - Triphosphate derivative acts as antiviral drug by blocking viral DNA polymerase and causes premature termination of viral DNA chains 
    - Uninfected cells do not phosphorylate acyclovir to acyclovir-5-monophosphate
    - Acyclovir triphosphate is more potent inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase than of analogous host cell enzymes
    - 10mg/kg IV TID in adults for 21 days 
    - Neonates less responsive so should get 20mg/kg IV TID for 21 days 
    - Administration concentration should be diluted to <7mg/ml (700mg in 100ml NS) 
    - infusion over 1 hour (no bolus) to minimise renal dysfunction
    - Alkaline pH so may cause local inflammation and phlebitis 
    - Dose adjustment in renal dysfunction
    - CSF penetration very good (50% of serum levels)
    - Complications
        - BUN and creatinine rise in 5% 
        - Thrombocytopenia
        - Nausea vomiting diarrhoea
        - Neurotoxicity (lethargy, obtundation, disorientation, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, tremor, seizures)
    - Resistance by DNA polymerase or viral deoxypyrimidine kinase changes 
- Orals 
    - HSV, VZV, EBV activity in acyclovir, famciclovir, valacyclovir but no clear evidence
    - Additional therapy after IV for 21 days has no use 
- IV Glucocorticoids have unclear value with no RCT available
- Ganciclovir, foscarnet maybe used in CMV related CNS infection but unproven efficacy
- Cidofovir in CMV not responding to ganciclovir or foscarnet 
- Ganciclovir
    - analogue of 2-deoxyguanosine 
    - Triphosphate acts as competitive inhibitor of CMV DNA polymerase and causes premature chain termination
    - 25-70% of serum concentration in CSF
    - 5mg/kg IV BD over 1 hour infusion as induction followed by 5mg/kg daily indefinitely (maintenance)
    - Induction done untile CSF cells or CSF CMV DNA levels or quantitative PCR declines
    - Dose adjustment in renal dysfunction
    - Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia are limiting factor (20-25%)
    - nausea vomiting diarrhoea abdominal pain in 20% 
    - CMV retinitis treatment has caused retinal detachment in some but unclear relationship
    - Valganciclovir is oral bioavailable prodrug but limited evidence in CNS infection
- Foscarnet
    - pyrophosphate analogue
    - 15-100% of plasma concentrations in CSF
    - 60mg/kg IV TID over 1 hour infusion as induction for 14-21 days (guided by CSF pleocytosis, DNA copy number, quantitative PCR)
    - followed by maintenance 60-120mg/kg/ day 
    - Reversible renal insufficiency in 1/3 and preventable with hydration
    - Fatigue and nausea
    - Reduced calcium, magnesium, potassium in 15% 
- Cidofovir
    -

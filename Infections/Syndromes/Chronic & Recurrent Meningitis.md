- syndrome exists for >4 weeks and is associated with a persistent inflammatory response in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (white cell count >5/Î¼L)
- Causes 
	- Meningeal infection 
	- malignancy 
	- Autoimmune inflammatory 
	- chemical meningitis 
	- parameningeal infection 
# Clinical Pathophysiology 
- Headache , hydrocephalus , meningeal signs, cranial neuropathies, radiculopathy , cognitive /personality changes 
- CSF -- choroid plexus --> narrow foramen in 4th ventricle --> subarachnoid space --> base of brain, hemisphere --> reabsorption by arachnoid villi 
- Spread from the subarachnoid space into brain parenchyma may occur via the arachnoid cuffs that surround blood vessels that penetrate brain tissue (Virchow-Robin spaces)

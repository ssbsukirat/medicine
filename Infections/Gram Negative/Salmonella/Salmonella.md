* Wide spectrum of disease
* *Typhi* and *Paratyphi* restricted to humans
* Enteric Fever
* nontyphoidal Salmonella, or NTS) can colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of a broad range of animals, includ- ing mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects
# Etiology
* Gram negative 
* non sporing
* facultative anaerobes
* Bacilli
* Acid on glucose fermentation
* Motile by peritrichous flaggela except gallinarum-pullorum
* reduce nitrate
* no cytochrome oxidase
* ***produce h2s except Typhi***
* Subspecies classified to serotypes based on 
	* the somatic O antigen (lipopolysaccharide cell-wall components)
	* surface Vi antigen (restricted to S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi C)
	* flagellar H antigen.
* Subspecies serotypes used as subspecies name and not full name
# Pathogenesis
- starts with contaminated food or water ingestion
- 200-10^6 CFU dose
- Risk increase by
    - reduced stomach acidity
        - age <1
        - PPI or suppression therapy
        - Achlorhydric disease
    - Reduced intestinal integrity
        - IBD
        - Cytotoxic chemo
        - GI surgery
        - Altered gut microbiome by antibiotics
- Penetrate mucosa and traverse the intestinal layer through phagocytic M cells in peyer patches 
- Ruffle formation by actin cytoskeleton alterations via type 3 secretion system leads to bacteria mediated endocytosis
- Sense environmental signals that alter bacteria pathway in macrophages
- PhoP/PhoQ triggers alterations in outer membrane to resist antimicrobial activity of host
- Another type 3 secretion system delivers protein to cytoplasm to remodel the vacuole for replication
- Dissemination in body via lymphatic and colonise reticuloendothelial tissues 
    - liver spleen bone marrow lymph node
- No signs symptoms in initial colonisation or incubation stage
- Fever and abdominal pain occur due to release of cytokines in response to salmonella
- Hepatosplenomegaly may occur due to mononuclear cell recruitment and cell mediated response
- Marked enlargement and necrosis of Peter patches due to mononuclear cell infiltration
- S typhi produces toxin causing symptoms and neuropsychiatric state 
- NTS 
    - massive polymorphonuclear infiltration in small bowel mucosa
    - Due to IL8 a neutrophil chemotactor 
    - Neutrophil degranulation causes toxin release and inflammatory diarrhea
    - NTS can utilise sulphur containing tetrathionated in microaerophilic environment allowing better survival in intestine

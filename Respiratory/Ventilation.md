# Definition and physiology 
* Paco2  is maintained between 37 and 43 mmHg at sea level. 
* All disorders of ventilation result in abnormal measurements of Paco2
* CO2 production by cellular metabolism is eliminate by respiration 
* Paco2  = (k) (Vco2)/VA, 
	* where Vco represents the ***carbon dioxide production,*** 
	* k is a constant, 
	* VA is fresh gas alveolar ventilation
		* calculated as ***minute ventilation × (1 – Vd/Vt),*** 
		* ***dead space fraction Vd/Vt*** represents the portion of a tidal breath that remains within the conducting airways at the conclusion of inspiration and so does not contribute to alveolar ventilation.
* disease affecting Vco2 
	* acute 
	* sepsis 
	* burns 
	* pyrexia 
* CHRONIC ventilation disorders 
	* inappropriate Minute ventilation 
	* increased dead space 
## Normal respiratory Cycle 
* spontaneous in brainstem 
* medulla 
	* into C/L spinal cord 
	* Phrenic nerve and diaphragm initiation 
	* airway muscles a
	* spinal respiratory neurons 
	* abdominal and intercostal muscles 
	* DRG 
		* Dorsal respiratory group 
		* initial integration site for afferent 
			* Pao2, paco2 ph and BP (carotid and aortic chemoreceptors and baroreceptors)
			* Vagus stretch receptor 
			*  juxtapulmonary capillary receptor in lung parenchyma and chest wall 
		* 
	* VRC
		* Ventral respiratory column 
		* Respiratory rhythm generation (also in more rostrally located parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) which also gives Active Expiration)
		* pre-Bötzinger complex
			* responsible for the generation of various forms of inspiration 
			* lesion causes complete cessation of breathing 
	* modulate by higher centres and autonomic 
	* attenuated response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia in sleep 
		* causes nocturnal hypoventilation

# Hypoventilation 
## Clinical Features 
* categories 
	* parenchymal lung and chest wall disease, 
	* sleep-disordered breathing, 
	* neuromuscular disease, 
	* respiratory drive disorders
* ![[hypoventilation-signs.png]]
* Manifestation dependent on 
	* severity of hypoventilation, 
	* rate at which hypercapnia develops
	* degree of compensation for respiratory acidosis
	* underlying disorder
* usually underlying lung disease present with reduced exercise capacity and shortness of breath 
* obstructive lung diseases (COPD)
	* Episodes of increased dyspnea and sputum production 
* [[Interstitial Lung Disease]] 
	* progressive dyspnea and cough are common 
* sleep-disordered breathing 
	* Excessive daytime somnolence, poor-quality sleep, and snoring are common 
* in neuromuscular disorders.
	* Sleep disturbance and orthopnea are also described  
	* As neuromuscular weakness progresses, the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, are placed at a mechanical disadvantage in the supine position due to the upward movement of the abdominal contents
	* New-onset orthopnea is frequently a sign of reduced respiratory muscle force generation.
	* extremity weakness or bulbar symptoms develop prior to sleep disturbance in neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or muscular dystrophy.
* Course 
	* an asymptomatic stage where daytime Pao2 and Paco2 are normal 
	* followed by nocturnal hypoventilation, initially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and later in non-REM sleep.
	* Finally, if vital capacity drops further, daytime hypercapnia develops
* PACO2 and PaCO2 increase 
* PAO2 decrease 
* erythropoiesis 
* chronic hypoxemia and hypercapnia may also induce 
	* pulmonary vasoconstriction,
	* leading eventually to pulmonary hypertension,
	* right ventricular hypertrophy, 
	* and right heart failure.
## Diagnosis 
* elevated serum bicarbonate + absence of volume depletion 
	* serum bicarbonate level <27 mmol/L in the setting of normal renal function makes the diagnosis very unlikely
	* serum bicarbonate >27 should prompt Paco2 as confirmatory 
* An arterial blood gas demonstrating elevated Paco2 with a normal pH confirms chronic alveolar hypoventilation 
* Physical examination, imaging studies (chest x-ray and/or CT scan), and pulmonary function tests 
* if investigation inconclusive screen for ***Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome*** 
	* most common sleep disorder causing hypoventilation 
	* accompanied by OSA 
		* Berlin Questionnaire 
		* Epworth Sleepiness Scale >10 (not useful for sleep disordered breathing )
		* STOP-Bang questionnaire 
* If lung, airway, chest excluded 
	* respiratory drive and neuromuscular disorders 
	* attenuated increase in minute ventilation in response to elevated CO2 and/or low O2 in respiratory drive disorders
	* suspected when normal respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function, and  alveolar-arterial Po2 difference.
	* Brain imaging (CT scan or MRI) can sometimes identify structural abnormalities in the pons or medulla 
	* Chronic narcotic use or significant hypothyroidism can depress the central respiratory drive
## Treatment 
* NIPPV (Nocturnal non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ) 
	* both central and obstructive 
	* in neuromuscular and chest wall disease 
	* improve daytime hypercapnia , prolong survival and QoL 
	* consider if symptoms of hypoventilation + one of 
		* Paco2 ≥45 mmHg; 
		* nocturnal oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤88% for 5 consecutive min; 
		* maximal inspiratory pressure <60 cmH2O; 
		* sniff nasal pressure <40 cmH2O and FVC <50% predicted
* agents that stimulate respiration, such as ***medroxyprogesterone and acetazolamide***, have been poorly studied, focus on treating cause 
* excessive metabolic alkalosis should be corrected, as serum bicarbonate levels elevated out of proportion for the degree of chronic respiratory acidosis can result in additional hypoventilation.
* supplementation of O2 may worsen hypercapnia 
* Phrenic nerve or diaphragm pacing is potential therapy 
# Hypoventilation Syndromes 
## Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome 
* Diagnosis (all)
	* BMI >30 kg/m2 
	* chronic daytime alveolar hypoventilation 
		* Paco2 ≥45 mmHg at sea level in the absence of other known causes of hypercapnia; 
	* evidence of sleep-disordered breathing.
* 90% have OSA, 70% severe OSA 
* Severe obesity (BMI >40kg) and severe OSA (AHI >30/hour) are risk factors 
* Pathogenesis 
	* OSA,
	* increased work of breathing, 
	* respiratory muscle impairment relative to the increased load because of excess adiposity,
	* ventilation-perfusion mismatching, 
	* depressed central ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxemia and hypercapnia
* Treat with weight reduction and positive pressure ventilation 
* 20-25% body weight loss normalises Paco2 
* BiPAP for not able to tolerate CPAP or CPAP 20mmhg but obstructive events persist 
* if hypercapnia persists after ***several weeks of CPAP therapy*** with adherence or ***OHS without OHA or acute decompensated OHS*** 
	* bilevel PAP with a ***backup rate (bilevel PAP ST or spontaneous timed) or volume-assured pressure support modes*** should be strongly considered
## Central Hypoventilation Syndrome 
* present later in life
* or in the neonatal period, 
	* when it is often called ***Ondine’s curse or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS)***
	* gene encoding ***PHOX2b***
* absent respiratory response to hypoxia or hypercapnia, mildly elevated Paco2 while awake, and markedly elevated Paco2 during non-REM sleep
* augment their ventilation and “normalize” Paco2 during exercise and during REM sleep. 
* NIPPV or mechanical ventilation 
* consider phrenic nerve or diaphragm pacing 
# Hyperventilation 
## Clinical Features 
* ventilation in excess of metabolic requirement leading to reduction in PaCO2 
* no typical presentation 
* dyspnea , paresthesia, tetany, headache , dizziness, visual disturbance and atypical chest pain 
* has initiating and sustaining factors 
* ***anxiety disorders and panic attacks are not synonymous with hyperventilation.***
## Diagnosis 
* maybe initial manifestation of DKA or systemic disorders 
* acute hyperventilation should be excluded 
* ABG 
	* compensated respiratory alkalosis
	* with a near normal pH, 
	* low Paco2, and 
	* low calculated bicarbonate
## Treatment 
* lack of universal treatment 
* reassurance and discussion 
* identify and eliminate habits that perpetuate hypocapnia 
* if palpitations and tremors --> beta blockers

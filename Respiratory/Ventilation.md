# Definition and physiology 
* Paco2  is maintained between 37 and 43 mmHg at sea level. 
* All disorders of ventilation result in abnormal measurements of Paco2
* CO2 production by cellular metabolism is eliminate by respiration 
* Paco2  = (k) (Vco2)/VA, 
	* where Vco represents the ***carbon dioxide production,*** 
	* k is a constant, 
	* VA is fresh gas alveolar ventilation
		* calculated as ***minute ventilation × (1 – Vd/Vt),*** 
		* ***dead space fraction Vd/Vt*** represents the portion of a tidal breath that remains within the conducting airways at the conclusion of inspiration and so does not contribute to alveolar ventilation.
* disease affecting Vco2 
	* acute 
	* sepsis 
	* burns 
	* pyrexia 
* CHRONIC ventilation disorders 
	* inappropriate Minute ventilation 
	* increased dead space 
## Normal respiratory Cycle 
* spontaneous in brainstem 
* medulla 
	* into C/L spinal cord 
	* Phrenic nerve and diaphragm initiation 
	* airway muscles a
	* spinal respiratory neurons 
	* abdominal and intercostal muscles 
	* DRG 
		* Dorsal respiratory group 
		* initial integration site for afferent 
			* Pao2, paco2 ph and BP (carotid and aortic chemoreceptors and baroreceptors)
			* Vagus stretch receptor 
			*  juxtapulmonary capillary receptor in lung parenchyma and chest wall 
		* 
	* VRC
		* Ventral respiratory column 
		* Respiratory rhythm generation (also in more rostrally located parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) which also gives Active Expiration)
		* pre-Bötzinger complex
			* responsible for the generation of various forms of inspiration 
			* lesion causes complete cessation of breathing 
	* modulate by higher centres and autonomic 
	* attenuated response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia in sleep 
		* causes nocturnal hypoventilation

# Hypoventilation 
## Clinical Features 
* categories 
	* parenchymal lung and chest wall disease, 
	* sleep-disordered breathing, 
	* neuromuscular disease, 
	* respiratory drive disorders
* ![[hypoventilation-signs.png]]
* Manifestation dependent on 
	* severity of hypoventilation, 
	* rate at which hypercapnia develops
	* degree of compensation for respiratory acidosis
	* underlying disorder
* usually underlying lung disease present with reduced exercise capacity and shortness of breath 
* obstructive lung diseases (COPD)
	* Episodes of increased dyspnea and sputum production 
* [[Interstitial Lung Disease]] 
	* progressive dyspnea and cough are common 
* sleep-disordered breathing 
	* Excessive daytime somnolence, poor-quality sleep, and snoring are common 
* in neuromuscular disorders.
	* Sleep disturbance and orthopnea are also described  
	* As neuromuscular weakness progresses, the respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm, are placed at a mechanical disadvantage in the supine position due to the upward movement of the abdominal contents
	* New-onset orthopnea is frequently a sign of reduced respiratory muscle force generation.
	* extremity weakness or bulbar symptoms develop prior to sleep disturbance in neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or muscular dystrophy.
* Course 
	* an asymptomatic stage where daytime Pao2 and Paco2 are normal 
	* followed by nocturnal hypoventilation, initially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and later in non-REM sleep.
	* Finally, if vital capacity drops further, daytime hypercapnia develops
* PACO2 and PaCO2 increase 
* PAO2 decrease 
* erythropoiesis 
* chronic hypoxemia and hypercapnia may also induce 
	* pulmonary vasoconstriction,
	* leading eventually to pulmonary hypertension,
	* right ventricular hypertrophy, 
	* and right heart failure.
## Diagnosis 
* elevated serum bicarbonate + absence of volume depletion 
	* serum bicarbonate level <27 mmol/L in the setting of normal renal function makes the diagnosis very unlikely
	* serum bicarbonate >27 should prompt Paco2 as confirmatory 
* An arterial blood gas demonstrating elevated Paco2 with a normal pH confirms chronic alveolar hypoventilation 
* Physical examination, imaging studies (chest x-ray and/or CT scan), and pulmonary function tests 
* if

# Definition and physiology 
* Paco2  is maintained between 37 and 43 mmHg at sea level. 
* All disorders of ventilation result in abnormal measurements of Paco2
* CO2 production by cellular metabolism is eliminate by respiration 
* Paco = (k) (Vco )/VA, 
	* where Vco represents the carbon dioxide production, 
	* k is a constant, 
	* VA is fresh gas alveolar ventilation
		* calculated as ***minute ventilation × (1 – Vd/Vt),*** 
		* ***dead space fraction Vd/Vt*** represents the portion of a tidal breath that remains within the conducting airways at the conclusion of inspiration and so does not contribute to alveolar ventilation.

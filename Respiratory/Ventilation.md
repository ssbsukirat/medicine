# Definition and physiology 
* Paco2  is maintained between 37 and 43 mmHg at sea level. 
* All disorders of ventilation result in abnormal measurements of Paco2
* CO2 production by cellular metabolism is eliminate by respiration 
* Paco2  = (k) (Vco2)/VA, 
	* where Vco represents the ***carbon dioxide production,*** 
	* k is a constant, 
	* VA is fresh gas alveolar ventilation
		* calculated as ***minute ventilation × (1 – Vd/Vt),*** 
		* ***dead space fraction Vd/Vt*** represents the portion of a tidal breath that remains within the conducting airways at the conclusion of inspiration and so does not contribute to alveolar ventilation.
* disease affecting Vco2 
	* acute 
	* sepsis 
	* burns 
	* pyrexia 
* CHRONIC ventilation disorders 
	* inappropriate Minute ventilation 
	* increased dead space 
## Normal respiratory Cycle 
* spontaneous in brainstem 
* medulla 
	* into C/L spinal cord 
	* Phrenic nerve and diaphragm initiation 
	* airway muscles a
	* spinal respiratory neurons 
	* abdominal and intercostal muscles 
	* DRG 
		* Dorsal respiratory group 
		* initial integration site for afferent 
			* Pao2, paco2 ph and BP (carotid and aortic chemoreceptors and baroreceptors)
			* Vagus stretch receptor 
			*  juxtapulmonary capillary receptor in lung parenchyma and chest wall 
		* 
	* VRC
		* Ventral respiratory column 
		* Respiratory rhythm generation (also in more rostrally located parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) which also gives Active Expiration)
		* pre-Bötzinger complex
			* responsible for the generation of various forms of inspiration 
			* lesion causes complete cessation of breathing 
	* modulate by higher centres and autonomic 
	* attenuated response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia in sleep 
		* causes nocturnal hypoventilation

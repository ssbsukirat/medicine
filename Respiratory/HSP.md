# Definition 
* aka extrinsic allergic alveolitis 
* pulmonary disease that occurs due to inhalational exposure to a variety of antigens leading to an inflammatory response of the ***alveoli and small airways***
* sensitisation is necessary for pathogenesis 
* sensitization alone is not sufficient as a defining characteristic, because many sensitized individuals do not develop HP
* ![[HSPetiology.png]]

# Pathophysiology 
* immune-mediated condition that occurs in response to inhaled antigens that are ***small enough to deposit in distal airways and alveoli.***
* characterized by dysregulated TH1 and TH17 immune responses 
* prominent role for ***adaptive*** immunity in the pathophysiology of HP, 
* ***innate*** immune mechanisms likely also important 
	* TLRs and MyD88 (downstream signaling protein) activated and cause neutrophil recruitment 
* Antigen processing gene polymorphism like TAP1 and MHC2 implicated 

# Clinical presentation 
* Acute subacute chronic 
* Acute 
	* 4–8 h following exposure to the inciting antigen, 
	* often intense in nature.
	* systemic features including fevers, chills, and malaise and dyspnea 
	* resolve in hours to days after stopping exposure 
* Subacute 
	* gradual course over weeks 
	* like multiple intermittent acute episodes 
	* severe respiratory impairment 
	* resolves in week to month after exposure 
* Chronic 
	* slow and gradual 
	* dyspnea , cough fatigue, weight loss , clubbing of digits 
	* some irreversible component 
	* may progress to fibrosis like IPF 
	* if fibrosis prognosis poor 
* New suggested classification 
	* recurrent systemic signs and symptoms vs Respiratory systems 
	* acute/inflammatory vs chronic/fibrotic 

# Diagnosis 
* No universal criteria 
* establish history of exposure 
* establishing an immunologic and physiologic response to inhalational antigen exposure
## CHEST imaging 
* xray is nonspecific 
	* acute subacute 
		* transient 
		* ill-defined micronodular opacities or ground-glass airspace opacities 
	* Chronic 
		* fibrotic 
		* like IPF 
* HRCT 
	* normal in acute forms 
		* lack of temporal correlation between exposure to the offending antigen and obtaining the imaging 
	* Subacute 
		* ground glass opacities 
		* centrilobular nodules 
		* air trapping on expiratory images 
	* Chronic 
		* reticular changes 
		* traction bronchiectasis 
		* subpleural honeycombing (like IPF)
		* ***lung bases spared (unlike IPF )***

## Pulmonary Function 
* either restrictive or obstructed 
* pattern not useful in diagnosis 
* characterizing the physiologic impairment of an individual patient 
* gauging the response to antigen avoidance and/or corticosteroid therapy.
* DLCO maybe impaired 
	* chronic with fibrosis 

## serum preciptins
* IgG antibodies against specific antigens 
* adjunct to diagnosis 
* alone is not sufficient 
* may give false negative as all known and unknown antigens cannot be tested 
## Bronchoscopy 
* With BAL 
* BAL lymphocytosis 
	* non specific 
	* characteristic 
	* lower threshold in smokers 
* CD4+/CD8+ <1 

## Lung Biopsy 
* bronchoscopic or surgical 
* not absolutely necessary 
* non caseating granuloma 
	* in vicinity of small airways 
	* loose and poorly defined (well defined in sarcoid)
* mixed cellular infiltrates in alveoli and interstitium 
	* patchy 
* bronchiolitis with organising exudates 
* fibrosis in chronic 
## Clinical prediction rule 
* 6 statistically significant predictors 
* strongest is exposure to antigen which is a known cause 
* serum preciptins 
* recurrent symptoms 
* symptoms 4-8h after exposure 
* crackles on inspiration 
* weight loss 
# Differential diagnosis 
* respiratory infections 
* chronic must be differentiate from IPF or NSIP 
* sarcoid if granulomatous 
	* hilar adenopathy 
	* other organ involvement 
	* well formed granuloma in sarcoid 
* Organic toxic dust Syndrome (OTDS)
# Treatment 
* antigen avoidance 
* identify antigen in vicinity 
* modify the environment to minimize patient exposure 
* Personal protective equipment can be used but may ***not provide adequate protection for sensitized individuals***
* must be balanced against the effects to an individual’s lifestyle or occupation 
* generally self limited 
* some role of glucocorticoids in subacute and chronic 
	* long term outcome same
	* accelerated resolution of symptoms 
	* prednisolone at 0.5-1mg/kg

# Definition 
* aka extrinsic allergic alveolitis 
* pulmonary disease that occurs due to inhalational exposure to a variety of antigens leading to an inflammatory response of the ***alveoli and small airways***
* sensitisation is necessary for pathogenesis 
* sensitization alone is not sufficient as a defining characteristic, because many sensitized individuals do not develop HP
* ![[HSPetiology.png]]

# Pathophysiology 
* immune-mediated condition that occurs in response to inhaled antigens that are ***small enough to deposit in distal airways and alveoli.***
* characterized by dysregulated TH1 and TH17 immune responses 
* prominent role for ***adaptive*** immunity in the pathophysiology of HP, 
* ***innate*** immune mechanisms likely also important 
	* TLRs and MyD88 (downstream signaling protein) activated and cause neutrophil recruitment 
* Antigen processing gene polymorphism like TAP1 and MHC2 implicated 

# Clinical presentation 
* Acute subacute chronic 
* Acute 
	* 4â€“8 h following exposure to the inciting antigen, 
	* often intense in nature.
	* systemic features including fevers, chills, and malaise and dyspnea 
	* resolve in hours to days after stopping exposure 
* Subacute 
	* gradual course over weeks 
	* like multiple intermittent acute episodes 
	* severe respiratory impairment 
	* resolves in week to month after exposure 
* Chronic 
	* slow and gradual 
	* dyspnea , cough fatigue, weight loss , clubbing of digits 
	* some irreversible component 
	* may progress to fibrosis like IPF 
	* if fibrosis prognosis poor 
* New suggested classification 
	* recurrent systemic signs and symptoms vs Respiratory systems 
	* acute/inflammatory vs chronic/fibrotic 

# Diagnosis 
* No universal criteria 
* establish history of exposure 
* establishing an immunologic and physiologic response to inhalational antigen exposure
## CHEST imaging 
* xray is nonspecific 
* acute subac

* irreversible airway dilation that involves the lung in either a focal or a diffuse manner 
* classically has been categorized as 
	* cylindrical or tubular (the most common form)
	* varicose
	* cystic

# Etiology 
* Infectious or non infectious 
* Pattern of involvement gives clues
* ***Focal*** bronchiectasis 
	* bronchiectatic changes in a localized area of the lung
	* consequence of ***obstruction of the airway*** 
		* either extrinsic (e.g., due to compression by adjacent lymphadenopathy or parenchymal tumor mass) 
		* intrinsic (e.g., due to an airway tumor or aspirated foreign body, a scarred/stenotic airway, or bronchial atresia from congenital underdevelopment of the airway).
* ***Diffuse*** bronchiectasis 
	* characterized by widespread bronchiectatic changes throughout the lung 
	* often arises from an ***underlying systemic or infectious disease process*** 
* ***upper*** lung fields 
	* is most ***common in CF*** 
	* also is observed in ***postradiation fibrosis***, corresponding to the lung region encompassed by the radiation port
* ***lower*** lung fields 
	* usually has its source in ***chronic recurrent aspiration*** (e.g., due to esophageal motility disorders like those in scleroderma),
	* end-stage ***fibrotic lung disease*** (e.g., traction bronchiectasis from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), 
	* or ***recurrent immunodeficiency-associated associated infections*** (e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia)
* Midlung fields 
	* Non-tubercular mycobacteria 
	* Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex

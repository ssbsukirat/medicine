* irreversible airway dilation that involves the lung in either a focal or a diffuse manner 
* classically has been categorized as 
	* cylindrical or tubular (the most common form)
	* varicose
	* cystic

# Etiology 
* Infectious or non infectious 
* Pattern of involvement gives clues
* ***Focal*** bronchiectasis 
	* bronchiectatic changes in a localized area of the lung
	* consequence of ***obstruction of the airway*** 
		* either extrinsic (e.g., due to compression by adjacent lymphadenopathy or parenchymal tumor mass) 
		* intrinsic (e.g., due to an airway tumor or aspirated foreign body, a scarred/stenotic airway, or bronchial atresia from congenital underdevelopment of the airway).
* ***Diffuse*** bronchiectasis 
	* characterized by widespread bronchiectatic changes throughout the lung 
	* often arises from an ***underlying systemic or infectious disease process*** 
* ***upper*** lung fields 
	* is most ***common in CF*** 
	* also is observed in ***postradiation fibrosis***, corresponding to the lung region encompassed by the radiation port
* ***lower*** lung fields 
	* usually has its source in ***chronic recurrent aspiration*** (e.g., due to esophageal motility disorders like those in scleroderma),
	* end-stage ***fibrotic lung disease*** (e.g., traction bronchiectasis from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), 
	* or ***recurrent immunodeficiency-associated associated infections*** (e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia)
* ***Midlung*** fields 
	* Non-tubercular mycobacteria 
	* Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (***MAC***) is most common 
	* Congenital ***dyskinetic/ immotile cilia syndrome***
* ***Central*** airways
	* association with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (***ABPA***), in which an immune-mediated reaction to Aspergillus damages the bronchial wall 
	* Congenital cartilage deficiency 
		* include tracheobronchomegaly (Mounier-Kuhn syndrome) 
		* Williams-Campbell syndrome.
* 25-30% have idiopathic disease with no clear etiology

# Epidemiology 
* patients with CF develop clinical bronchiectasis in late adolescence or early adulthood
* atypical presentations of CF in adults in their thirties and forties are also possible.
* MAC infection classically affects nonsmoking women >50 years of age
* Incidence increases with age 
* F > M
* May be co-diagnosed with COPD or asthma 
* tuberculosis is prevalent, bronchiectasis occurs as a sequela of granulomatous infection
	* ***Focal*** bronchiectasis from ***extrinsic*** compression by enlarged granulomatous lymph nodes and/or from ***intrinsic*** obstruction as a result of erosion of a calcified lymph node through the airway wall (e.g., broncholithiasis)
	* reactivated tuberculosis, parenchymal destruction from infection can result in areas of more ***diffuse*** bronchiectasis.

# Pathogenesis 
* most accepted is ***Vicious cycle hypothesis***

* region between pleural sacs 
* 3 compartments 
	* ![[mediastinum-parts.png]]
	* Anterior 
		* sternum to pericardium + brachiocephalic vessels 
		* thymus + the anterior mediastinal lymph nodes + internal mammary arteries and veins.
	* middle 
		* between the anterior and posterior mediastina
		* contains
			* heart; 
			* the ascending and transverse arches of the aorta; 
			* the venae cavae;
			* the brachiocephalic arteries and veins; 
			* the phrenic nerves; 
			* the trachea,
			* the main bronchi, and their contiguous lymph nodes;
			* and the pulmonary arteries and veins. 
		* posterior 
			* the pericardium and trachea anteriorly and the vertebral column posteriorly. 
			* contents 
				* descending thoracic aorta, 
				* the esophagus, 
				* thoracic duct, 
				* azygos and hemiazygos veins,

# Mediastinal Masses 
* 1st place in compartments 
* CT is imaging of choice 
* If posterior mediastinal 
	* Barium Swallow 
		* hernias, diverticula, and achalasia
* Iodine-131 scan for intrathoracic goitre 
* Mediastinoscopy in anterior or middle (VATS is alternate ) 
* percutaneous FNAC or endoscopy USG-guided biopsy minimally invasive 
* VATS for removal 

# Acute mediastinitis 
* esophageal perforation
	* acutely ill 
	* chest pain 
	* dyspnea 
	* explore + primary repair 
*  after median sternotomy for cardiac surgery (0.4-5.0%)
	* present with wound drainage. 
	* sepsis and a widened mediastinum. 
	* diagnosis with mediastinal needle aspiration. 
	* Treatment includes immediate drainage, debridement, and parenteral antibiotic
	* high mortality 20% 
* Infections from neck, oral , facial 
# CHRONIC Mediastinitis 
* granulomatous inflammation of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum 
	* histoplasmosis or TB 
	* silicosis 
	* sarcoid 
	* fungal 
	* usually asymptomatic 
* fibrosing mediastinitis 
	* signs of compression of a mediastinal structure such as the superior vena cava or large airways, phrenic or recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis,
	* obstruction of the pulmonary artery or proximal pulmonary veins.
	* If veins or arteries are involved 
		* stent placement 
# Pneumomediasti

* episodic airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness usually accompanied by airway inflammation
* usually obstruction is reversible but maybe irreversible in a small subset 
* Mostly eosinophilic inflammation ( maybe other type or no inflammation also )
# Manifestation 
* episodic shortness of breath 
* wheeze 
* cough 
* with trigger or spontaneous 
* chest tightness or mucus production 
* exacerbations --> episode of acute bronchospasm 
# Epidemiology 

# Pathway to development of asthma 
* interplay of 
	* genetics 
	* environment 
	* endogenous development factors 
* ![[asthma-triggers.png]]
* ![[asthma-pathway.png]]
# Pathophysiology 
## MECHANISMS LEADING TO ACUTE AND CHRONIC AIRWAY Obstruction 
* ![[asthma-airwaypath.png]]
* process may occur individual or simultaneously 
* temporal variation in process also seen 
* ***Parenchyma not involved***
* entire airway maybe involved 
	* spatial heterogenecity ++ 

### Airway hyperresponsiveness 
* hallmark of asthma 
* acute narrowing response of the airways in reaction to agents that do not elicit airway responses in non- affected individuals or
* excess narrowing response to inhaled agents as compared to that which would occur in nonaffected individuals 
* some component at level of smooth muscle itself 
	* to histamine or methacoline 
* inDirect activation of narrowing mechanism due to inflammatory cell stimulation 
	* release bronchoconstrictors
	* mediators --> edema and mucus secretion 
* stimulation of sensory nerves acting on smooth muscle or inflammatory cells 
* structural etiology maybe present 
	* wall thickness associated with severity and duration 
	* smooth muscle hypertrophy & hyperplasia 
	* subepithelial collagen deposits 
	* airway edema 
	* mucosal inflammation 
* therapy to target airway hyperresponsiveness

* episodic airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness usually accompanied by airway inflammation
* usually obstruction is reversible but maybe irreversible in a small subset 
* Mostly eosinophilic inflammation ( maybe other type or no inflammation also )
# Manifestation 
* episodic shortness of breath 
* wheeze 
* cough 
* with trigger or spontaneous 
* chest tightness or mucus production 
* exacerbations --> episode of acute bronchospasm 
# Epidemiology 

# Pathway to development of asthma 
* interplay of 
	* genetics 
	* environment 
	* endogenous development factors

# Pathophysiology 
## MECHANISMS LEADING TO ACUTE AND CHRONIC AIRWAY Obstruction 
* ![[asthma-airwaypath.png]]
* process may occur individual or simultaneously 
* temporal variation in process also seen 
* ***Parenchyma not involved***
* entire airway maybe involved 
	* spatial heterogenecity ++ 

### Airway hyperresponsiveness 
* hallm

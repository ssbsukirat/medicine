* episodic airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness usually accompanied by airway inflammation
* usually obstruction is reversible but maybe irreversible in a small subset 
* Mostly eosinophilic inflammation ( maybe other type or no inflammation also )
# Manifestation 
* episodic shortness of breath 
* wheeze 
* cough 
* with trigger or spontaneous 
* chest tightness or mucus production 
* exacerbations --> episode of acute bronchospasm 
# Epidemiology 

# Pathway to development of asthma 
* interplay of 
	* genetics 
	* environment 
	* endogenous development factors

# Pathophysiology 
## MECHANISMS LEADING TO ACUTE AND CHRONIC AIRWAY Obstruction 
* ![[asthma-airwaypath.png]]
* process may occur individual or simultaneously 
* temporal variation in process also seen 
* ***Parenchyma not involved***
* entire airway maybe involved 
	* spatial heterogenecity ++ 

### Airway hyperresponsiveness 
* hallmark of asthma 
* acute narrowing response of the airways in reaction to agents that do not elicit airway responses in non- affected individuals or
* excess narrowing response to inhaled agents as compared to that which would occur in nonaffected individuals 
* some component at level of smooth muscle itself 
	* to histamine or methacoline 
* inDirect activation of narrowing mechanism due to inflammatory cell stimulation 
	* release bronchoconstrictors
	* mediators --> edema and mucus secretion 
* stimulation of sensory nerves acting on smooth muscle or inflammatory cells 
* structural etiology maybe present 
	* wall thickness associated with severity and duration 
	* smooth muscle hypertrophy & hyperplasia 
	* subepithelial collagen deposits 
	* airway edema 
	* mucosal inflammation 
* therapy to target airway hyperresponsiveness 
### Inflammatory Cells 
* chronic inflammation of airways ++ 
* commonly is eosinophilic nature 
* some with ***severe*** asthma have ***neutrophil inflammation*** 
* mast cells ++ 
### Airway smooth muscle 
* hyperresponsiveness to stimuli 
* hypertrophy and hyperplasia 
* produce chemokines and cytokines that promote inflammation 
### Subepithelial collagen deposits 
* deposition of repair-type collagens and tenascin, periostin, fibronectin, and osteopontin primarily from myofibroblasts under the epithelium.
* stiffens the airway and can result in exaggerated responses to increased circumferential tension exerted by the smooth muscle.
### airway epithelium 
* epithelium disruption takes the form of separation of columnar cells from the basal cells
* form a trophic unit with the underlying mesenchyme.
* releases cytokine 
### Vascular proliferation 
* significant angiogenesis thought to be secondary to elaboration of angiogenic factors in the context of airway inflammation 
### Airway edema 
### Epithelial goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion 
* Mucus plugs can obstruct medium-size airways and can extend into the small airways 
### neuronal proliferation 
* Neurotrophins, which can lead to neuronal proliferation, are elaborated by smooth-muscle cells, epithelial cells, and inflammatory cells.
* mediate acute bronchospasm and potentially chronically increased airway tone
## Airway inflammation 
* in most asthma 
* earlier atopic/extrinsic vs nonatopic/intrinsic 
* atopic 
	* allergen sensitivity 
	* IgE 
	* children 
* Nonatopic 
	* late onset 
	* with or without allergy 
	* eosinophilic 
* now ***type 2 inflammation or not***
* Type 2 inflammation 
	* innate and adaptive arms of the immune system to ***promote barrier immunity on mucosal surfaces.***
	* associated with the type 2 subset of CD4+ T-helper cells,
		* produce interleukin (IL) 4, IL-5, and IL-13.
	* IL-4
		* induces B-cell isotype switching to production of IgE. 
		* IgE, binding to basophils and mast cells, results in environmental sensitivity to allergens as a result of cross-linking of IgE on the surface of these mast cells and basophils.
	* IL-5 has a critical role in regulating eosinophils
	* IL-13 induces airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus hypersecretion, and goblet cell metaplasia
	* non allergic stimuli can cause type 2 also 
		* stimulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2)
		* ILC2 produce IL-5 and IL-13. 
		* ILC2s can be activated by epithelial cytokines known as alarmins, which are produced in response to “nonallergic” epithelial exposures such as irritants, pollutants, oxidative agents, fungi, or viruses, leading to eosinophilia 
	* eosinophils 
		* hyperresponsiveness through MBP which disrupts epithelium 
* Non type 2 process 
	* with or without type 2
	* neutrophilic inflammation 
		* severe asthma not responding to corticosteroids 
	* chronic infections 
		* atypical like Mycoplasma 
		* respond to macrolide 
		* in Reactive airway dysfunction syndromes

# Mediators 
* Cytokine 
	* IL-4 IL-5 IL-13 
	* targeted in therapy 
	* Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)
	* IL-25, IL-33 in signalling cascade with TSLP
	* IL- 9
	* IL-6,IL-17 TNF-α , IL-1B IL-8 in non type 2 
* Fatty acids 
	* leukotriene and prostaglandins 
	* Cysteinyl leukotriene (C4, D4, E4) 
		* by eosinophils and mast cells 
		* smooth muscle constrictors 
		* also stimulate mucus secretion, recruit allergic inflammatory cells, cause microvascular leakage, modulate cytokine production, and influence neural transmission
	* LTB4 (non cysteinyl leukotriene )
		* neutrophil mainly 
		* macrophage and epithelium 
		* neutrophil chemotactor 
	* PGD2
		* mast cells 
		* CRTH2 receptors
			* are present on TH2 cells, ILC2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells 
			* activation upregulates type 2 inflammation
	* resolution of inflammation 
		* ***resolvins and lipoxins*** 
		* deficiency causes ongoing inflammation 
* Nitric Oxide 
	* Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator,
	* increase mucus production and smooth-muscle proliferation.
	* produced by epithelial cells, in response to IL-13, and by inflammatory cells including eosinophils, mast cells, and neutrophils.
* Reactive oxygen species 
	* inflammatory cells activation in the airway, induces respiratory bursts
	* release reactive oxygen species that result in oxidative stress in the surrounding tissue.
	* affect smooth-muscle contraction, increase mucus secretion, produce airway hyperresponsiveness, and result in epithelial shedding.
* Chemokines 
	* eotaxin (an eosinophil chemoattractant), 
	* TARC and MDC (which attract T 2 cells), 
	* RANTES (which has pluripotent prophlogistic effects).

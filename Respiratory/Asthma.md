* episodic airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness usually accompanied by airway inflammation
* usually obstruction is reversible but maybe irreversible in a small subset 
* Mostly eosinophilic inflammation ( maybe other type or no inflammation also )
# Manifestation 
* episodic shortness of breath 
* wheeze 
* cough 
* with trigger or spontaneous 
* chest tightness or mucus production 
* exacerbations --> episode of acute bronchospasm 
# Epidemiology 

# Pathway to development of asthma 
* interplay of 
	* genetics 
	* environment 
	* endogenous development factors

# Pathophysiology 
## MECHANISMS LEADING TO ACUTE AND CHRONIC AIRWAY Obstruction 
* ![[asthma-airwaypath.png]]
* process may occur individual or simultaneously 
* temporal variation in process also seen 
* ***Parenchyma not involved***
* entire airway maybe involved 
	* spatial heterogenecity ++ 

### Airway hyperresponsiveness 
* hallmark of asthma 
* acute narrowing response of the airways in reaction to agents that do not elicit airway responses in non- affected individuals or
* excess narrowing response to inhaled agents as compared to that which would occur in nonaffected individuals 
* some component at level of smooth muscle itself 
	* to histamine or methacoline 
* inDirect activation of narrowing mechanism due to inflammatory cell stimulation 
	* release bronchoconstrictors
	* mediators --> edema and mucus secretion 
* stimulation of sensory nerves acting on smooth muscle or inflammatory cells 
* structural etiology maybe present 
	* wall thickness associated with severity and duration 
	* smooth muscle hypertrophy & hyperplasia 
	* subepithelial collagen deposits 
	* airway edema 
	* mucosal inflammation 
* therapy to target airway hyperresponsiveness 
### Inflammatory Cells 
* chronic inflammation of airways ++ 
* commonly is eosinophilic nature 
* some with ***severe*** asthma have ***neutrophil inflammation*** 
* mast cells ++ 
### Airway smooth muscle 
* hyperresponsiveness to stimuli 
* hypertrophy and hyperplasia 
* produce chemokines and cytokines that promote inflammation 
### Subepithelial collagen deposits 
* deposition of repair-type collagens and tenascin, periostin, fibronectin, and osteopontin primarily from myofibroblasts under the epithelium.
* stiffens the airway and can result in exaggerated responses to increased circumferential tension exerted by the smooth muscle.
### airway epithelium 
* epithelium disruption takes the form of separation of columnar cells from the basal cells
* form a trophic unit with the underlying mesenchyme.
* releases cytokine 
### Vascular proliferation 
* significant angiogenesis thought to be secondary to elaboration of angiogenic factors in the context of airway inflammation 
### Airway edema 
### Epithelial goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion 
* Mucus plugs can obstruct medium-size airways and can extend into the small airways 
### neuronal proliferation 
* Neurotrophins, which can lead to neuronal proliferation, are elaborated by smooth-muscle cells, epithelial cells, and inflammatory cells.
* mediate acute bronchospasm and potentially chronically increased airway tone
## Airway inflammation 
* in most asthma 
* earlier atopic/extrinsic vs nonatopic/intrinsic 
* atopic 
	* allergen sensitivity 
	* IgE 
	* children 
* Nonatopic 
	* late onset 
	* with or without allergy 
	* eosinophilic 
* now ***type 2 inflammation or not***
* Type 2 inflammation

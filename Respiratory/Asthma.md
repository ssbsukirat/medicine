Here are notes from the provided chapter:

### Definition

- Asthma is characterized by **episodic airway obstruction** and **airway hyperresponsiveness**, usually with airway inflammation.
- Airway obstruction is mostly **reversible**, but can become irreversible in some patients.
- Airway inflammation is often **eosinophilic**, but other types or no obvious inflammation can also occur.

### Manifestations

- Most frequent presentation: **episodic shortness of breath**, **wheezing**, and **cough**, which can be triggered or spontaneous.
- Symptoms can be combined or separate.
- Other symptoms: **chest tightness** and/or **mucus production**.
- Symptoms may resolve spontaneously or with therapy.
- Wheezing and/or dyspnea can be persistent in some patients.
- Acute bronchospasm episodes (**exacerbations**) can be severe, requiring emergency care or hospitalization, and may result in death.

### Epidemiology

- Asthma is the **most common chronic disease** with significant morbidity and mortality, affecting ~241 million globally.
- **Prevalence in the US**: **7.9%** (compared to ~4.3% worldwide).
- Prevalence is increasing, associated with **transition from rural to urban living**.
- **More prevalent in children (8.4%) than adults (7.7%)**.
- In children, prevalence is greatest among boys (**2:1 male-to-female ratio**), but trends towards greater prevalence in women in adulthood.
- Some patients experience resolution in adulthood, with later "recurrence".
- In 2016 US: **1.8 million ED visits** and **189,000 hospitalizations** for asthma.
- Total economic cost in US (2007) estimated at **$56 billion**.
- More prevalent in **blacks than Caucasians** in the US, with black race linked to greater case morbidity.
- **Puerto Rican population** has the greatest prevalence in the US.
- Global mortality increased in the 1960s (likely due to overuse of inhaled β2-agonists).
- Mortality reduction attributed to increased inhaled corticosteroid use.
- Global mortality declined from 0.44 per 100,000 (1993) to 0.19 (2006), with no further reduction since.

### The Pathway to the Development of Asthma

- Development pathway is varied, involving an **interplay between genetic susceptibility, environmental exposure, and endogenous developmental factors** (e.g., aging, menopause).
- Continued or additional exposures and triggers influence disease progression and impairment.
- **Disease expression** is characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, varying degrees of airway inflammation, and structural changes, accompanied by symptoms influenced by triggers.

### Pathophysiology

#### Mechanisms Leading to Acute and Chronic Airway Obstruction

- Pathobiologic processes in airways lead to episodic and chronic obstruction.
- Processes can occur individually or simultaneously, with temporal and spatial variation.
- Involve the entire airway (not parenchyma), but can have significant spatial heterogeneity.
- Pathologic changes in asthmatic airways:
    - **Reduced airway lumen** due to smooth-muscle constriction, mucus, and submucosal thickening (edema, cellular infiltration).
    - Impaired lumen increase with smooth-muscle relaxation due to **collagen deposition**.
    - **Disrupted epithelium**, **vascular and neuronal proliferation**.
    - Not all changes present in one individual; some patients may have normal-appearing airways.

##### Airway Hyperresponsiveness

- A **hallmark of asthma**.
- Defined as **acute airway narrowing** in response to agents that do not affect non-affected individuals, or an excessive narrowing response.
- Component occurs at the airway smooth muscle itself (e.g., hyperresponsiveness to histamine or methacholine).
- Often due to **indirect activation** via inflammatory cells (releasing bronchoconstrictors, mediators causing edema/mucus) or sensory nerve stimulation.
- Increased responsiveness may have a **structural etiology**.
- **Airway wall thickening** (smooth-muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, subepithelial collagen deposition, edema, mucosal inflammation) leads to disproportionate narrowing.
- Major therapeutic objective: **decrease airway hyperresponsiveness**.

##### Inflammatory Cells

- Most asthmatics have **chronic inflammation** in airways, often **eosinophilic**.
- **Neutrophilic inflammation** may predominate in severe asthma.
- **Mast cells** are more frequent and often activated.

##### Airway Smooth Muscle

- Contributes in three ways:
    - **Hyperresponsive** to stimuli.
    - **Hypertrophy and hyperplasia** lead to airway wall thickening, affecting hyperresponsiveness.
    - Produces **chemokines and cytokines** promoting airway inflammation and survival of inflammatory cells (especially mast cells).

##### Subepithelial Collagen Deposition and Matrix Deposition

- **Thickening of subepithelial basement membrane** from deposition of repair-type collagens, tenascin, periostin, fibronectin, osteopontin (mainly from myofibroblasts).
- **Stiffens the airway**, leading to exaggerated responses to smooth muscle tension.
- Can **narrow the airway lumen** and decrease its ability to relax, contributing to chronic obstruction.

##### Airway Epithelium

- **Disruption**: separation of columnar from basal cells.
- Damaged epithelium forms a trophic unit with underlying mesenchyme, elaborating growth factors (contributing to remodeling) and cytokines/mediators (promoting inflammation).

##### Vascular Proliferation

- Significant **angiogenesis** occurs in a subset of asthmatics, possibly secondary to angiogenic factors from inflammation.
- Inflammatory mediators can cause **leakage from postcapillary venules**, contributing to acute and chronic airway edema.

##### Airway Edema

- **Submucosal edema** can be an acute response and a chronic contributor to airway wall thickening.

##### Epithelial Goblet Cell Metaplasia and Mucus Hypersecretion

- Chronic inflammation leads to appearance and proliferation of **mucus cells**.
- Increased mucus production **reduces airway luminal area**.
- **Mucus plugs** can obstruct medium-sized airways and extend into small airways.

##### Neuronal Proliferation

- **Neurotrophins** (from smooth muscle, epithelial, inflammatory cells) lead to neuronal proliferation.
- Neuronal inputs regulate **smooth-muscle tone and mucus production**, mediating acute bronchospasm and potentially chronic increased airway tone.

#### Airway Inflammation (Type 2 and Non–Type 2 Inflammation)

- Most asthma is accompanied by **airway inflammation**.
- Old paradigm: atopic (allergen sensitivity, IgE, common in children) vs. nonatopic/intrinsic (later onset, with/without allergies, often eosinophilia).
- New paradigm: **Type 2 vs. Non–Type 2 inflammation** based on immune processes and targeted therapies.

##### Type 2 Inflammation

- Immune response involving innate and adaptive systems for **barrier immunity on mucosal surfaces**.
- Associated with **Type 2 CD4+ T-helper cells** producing **IL-4, IL-5, IL-13**.
- **IL-4**: Induces B-cell isotype switching to **IgE production**. IgE binds to mast cells and basophils, leading to allergen sensitivity upon cross-linking, releasing Type 2 cytokines, direct bronchoconstrictors, and edema mediators.
- **IL-5**: Critical for **regulating eosinophils** (formation, recruitment, survival).
- **IL-13**: Induces **airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus hypersecretion, and goblet cell metaplasia**.
- **Nonallergic stimuli** (irritants, pollutants, oxidative agents, fungi, viruses) can also elicit Type 2 cytokines, especially via **Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2)**, which produce IL-5 and IL-13 when activated by epithelial alarmins.
- Anti–IL-5 drugs show **eosinophils play a major role** in asthma pathobiology.
- Eosinophils may induce hyperresponsiveness by releasing oxidative radicals and major basic protein, disrupting epithelium.
- Mucus plugs, potentially with eosinophil aggregates, may accumulate and contribute to severity.

##### Non–Type 2 Processes

- Can exist **with or without Type 2 inflammation**.
- **Neutrophilic inflammation** can occur, more common in **severe asthma** unresponsive to corticosteroids (which suppress Type 2 inflammation).
- May be associated with **chronic infection** (e.g., Mycoplasma), explaining response to macrolides.
- Common in **reactive airway dysfunction syndrome (RADS)**.
- A small subset of asthmatics may have pathologic changes without inflammatory cell infiltration (**pauci-granulocytic asthma**).

#### Mediators

- Many chemical substances/signaling factors contribute to asthma pathobiology.
- Some have been successfully targeted in therapies.

##### Cytokines

- **IL-4, IL-5, IL-13** are major cytokines in Type 2 inflammation and successful therapy targets.
- **TSLP, IL-25, IL-33** also play a role and are studied as targets.
- **IL-9** has been implicated.
- **IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8** implicated in non–Type 2 inflammation.

##### Fatty Acid Mediators

- Proinflammatory: **leukotrienes** and **prostaglandins** from arachidonic acid.
- **Cysteinyl leukotrienes (C4, D4, E4)**: produced by eosinophils and mast cells; **potent smooth-muscle constrictors**; stimulate mucus, recruit inflammatory cells, cause microvascular leakage, modulate cytokine, influence neural transmission.
    - **Cysteinyl leukotriene modifiers** show clinical benefit.
- **LTB4**: produced by neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells; potent **neutrophil chemoattractant**.
- **Prostaglandins**: mostly proinflammatory.
- **Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)**: produced by mast cells; its receptors (**CRTH2**) on TH2, ILC2, mast, eosinophils, macrophages, epithelial cells **upregulate Type 2 inflammation**.
    - Drugs blocking CRTH2 show mild to moderate effectiveness.
- **Resolvins and lipoxins**: fatty acid-derived mediators for **resolution of inflammation**. Deficiencies may contribute to ongoing inflammation, especially in severe asthma.

##### Nitric Oxide

- **Potent vasodilator**.
- In vitro: may increase mucus production and smooth-muscle proliferation.
- Produced by epithelial cells (especially in response to IL-13) and stimulated inflammatory cells (eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils).
- Role in asthmatic diathesis unclear.
- Increased in airways with eosinophilic inflammation and detectable in exhaled breath.

##### Reactive Oxygen Species

- Released by inflammatory cells upon activation by allergens, pollutants, bacteria, viruses.
- Cause **oxidative stress** in surrounding tissue.
- Increase oxidative stress affects smooth-muscle contraction, mucus secretion, airway hyperresponsiveness, and epithelial shedding.

##### Chemokines

- Secreted by epithelium and other inflammatory cells to **attract inflammatory cells** to airways.
- Examples: **eotaxin** (eosinophil chemoattractant), **TARC and MDC** (attract TH2 cells), **RANTES** (pluripotent pro-phlogistic effects).

### Etiologic Mechanisms, Risk Factors, Triggers, and Complicating Comorbidities

- Asthma development is an interplay between risk factors, exposures, and genetic predisposition.

#### Heritable Predisposition

- **Strong genetic predisposition**: 25–80% heritability from family/twin studies.
- **Complex polygenic inheritance** interacting with environmental exposures.
- **Epigenetic modifications** related to environmental exposures can also produce heritable patterns.
- Many asthma-related genes associated with **atopy risk**.
- Identified candidate genes (vary by population): **ORMDL3/GSDMB (17q21), ADAM33, DPP-10, TSLP, IL-12, IL-33, ST2, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQB2, TLR1, IL6R**.
- Polymorphisms often in noncoding regions, acting as "enhancers" of biologic processes.
- Genetic polymorphisms associated with **differential responses to therapies** (e.g., β-receptor variants, glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 gene, leukotriene pathways).
- Unraveling genetic contribution is elusive; only **2.5% of asthma risk explained by 31 SNPs**.
- Significant proportion of heritability relates to **heritability of atopy** (genetic tendency for specific IgE production).
- **Serum IgE levels correlate with asthma development**.
- NHANES III: Half of asthma (ages 6–59) attributed to atopy with allergic sensitization evidence.
- Allergens most associated with risk: **house dust mites, indoor fungi, cockroaches, indoor animals**.

#### Exposures and Risk Factors

##### Allergic Sensitization and Allergen Exposure

- Involves interplay of heritable susceptibility and allergen exposure.
- Exposure during vulnerable developmental periods increases risk in atopy-prone individuals.
- Increased in industrialized nations.
- Varied microbiome exposure (bacteria/products) may influence atopy, with decreased risk in rural environments.
- Early allergen avoidance studies show contradictory results.

##### Tobacco

- **Maternal smoking** and **secondhand smoke** linked to increased childhood asthma.
- Childhood secondhand smoke doubles asthma risk.
- Active smoking increases incidence by up to fourfold in adolescents/young adults.

##### Air Pollution

- **Early life exposure** increases asthma risk.
- Proximity to major roadways increases early childhood asthma risk (attributed to nitrogen dioxide).
- Decreasing NO2 exposure decreases asthma incidence in children.
- Mixed pollutants: most risk from **carbon monoxide and nitric dioxide**.
- Indoor pollution (open fires, gas stoves) linked to increased childhood asthma symptoms.
- Mechanistically: pollutants cause oxidative injury, airway inflammation, remodeling, increased sensitization risk.

##### Infections

- Respiratory infections can **precipitate asthma deteriorations**.
- Causal role vs. susceptibility/protection unclear.
- Incidence/frequency of human rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus in children associated with asthma development.
- Prior Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection associated with asthma in Taiwanese adults.

##### Occupational Exposures

- Estimated **10–25% of adult-onset asthma**.
- Most common in nursing and cleaning occupations.
- Two types:
    - **Immunologic stimulus** (high-molecular-weight like proteins/flour, or low-molecular-weight like formaldehyde/diisocyanate) - has latency period.
    - **Irritative stimulus** (Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome - RADS).
- Influenced by genetic predisposition (atopy), timing, intensity, co-exposure (e.g., smoking).

##### Diet

- Suggestions that prenatal diet or vitamin deficiency may alter risk.
- Not definitive, but **vitamin D insufficiency may increase risk**; supplementation may decrease.
- Preliminary studies: maternal supplementation with **vitamins C, E, and zinc** may decrease childhood asthma.
- Maternal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation may decrease childhood asthma risk.
- Observational studies: increased maternal sugar intake may increase childhood asthma risk.

##### Obesity

- Multiple studies suggest obesity is a **risk factor for childhood and adult asthma**.
- Adipokines and IL-6 thought to play a pathobiologic role.
- Some argue risk is overestimated; NHANES II found association with dyspnea but not airway obstruction.

##### Medications

- Conflicting data on prenatal/early childhood asthma risk from certain medications.
- H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors in pregnancy associated with increased risk (RR 1.36–1.45), though one study found small risk for H2 blockers only.
- Conflicting data on perinatal/early childhood acetaminophen use; prospective study found no increased exacerbation risk compared to ibuprofen.

##### Prenatal and Perinatal Risk Factors

- **Preeclampsia** and **prematurity** associated with increased asthma risk in progeny.
- Babies born by **cesarean section** are at higher risk.
- Those with **neonatal jaundice** are at increased risk.
- **Breast-feeding** reduced early wheezing but unclear effect on later asthma incidence.

##### Endogenous Developmental Risk Factors

- **More prevalent in boys** than girls, reversing by age 40 (more prevalent in women).
- Boys have more childhood atopy and reduced airway size.
- Subset of women develop asthma around menopause, often involving non–Type 2 mechanisms.
- Pregnancy may precipitate or aggravate asthma.

##### High-Concentration Irritant Exposure and RADS

- **Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS)**: solitary exposure to high concentration of irritants rapidly producing bronchospasm and bronchial hyperactivity.
- Causative agents: oxidizing/reducing agents in aerosol, high particulates.
- Acute pathology: epithelial injury with neutrophilia; little evidence of Type 2 inflammation.
- Differs from occupational asthma: patients not sensitized, can return to environment after recovery.
- Course variable; documented abnormalities and persistent symptoms 10 years post-exposure.

##### Fungi and Allergic Airway Mycoses

- **1-2% of asthma patients** may have IgE-mediated sensitization to airway colonization by fungi, most commonly **Aspergillus fumigatus**.
- **Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)**: Type 2 airway inflammatory response to Aspergillus.
    - Characteristics: IgE >1000 IU/mL, eosinophils >500/μL, positive skin test to Aspergillus, specific IgE/IgG antibodies to Aspergillus.
    - May have intermittent mucus plugging and central bronchiectasis.
    - Up to two-thirds grow Aspergillus from sputum.
    - Treatment: systemic antifungal (itraconazole or voriconazole) and oral corticosteroids.

##### Exercise-Induced Symptoms in Elite Athletes

- Airway narrowing in elite athletes during extreme exercise in strenuous conditions.
- May have little/no airway hyperreactivity or asthma risk factors.
- May involve additional mechanisms, including **direct epithelial injury**.
- Reported in swimmers, possibly related to pool chlorination.

#### Triggers of Airway Narrowing

- Lead to increased airway reactivity and propensity to react to factors causing narrowing.
- Almost all asthmatics can identify triggers that worsen their asthma.
- Triggers often overlap with risk/etiologic factors.
- Elimination of triggers may dramatically reduce impairment; abatement can lead to "remission" in a minority.
- Acute exposures generally cause short-lived bronchospasm, but can be severe enough for exacerbation treatment.
- Chronic exposure may lead to permanent deterioration (not for exercise/stress).
- Severe asthma exacerbations may accelerate lung function decline.

##### Allergens

- In sensitized patients, inhalation leads to **mast cell/basophil activation** and acute bronchoactive mediator production.
- Can produce **immediate bronchospasm** (early response) and a **late response** (2–24h after exposure) with narrowing and inflammation.
- Accounts for reactions to: pollens, mold, dust, insects (cockroaches), animals, occupational materials, seasonal worsening, "thunderstorm asthma".
- Chronic exposure can lead to persistent symptoms.
- Food allergies can cause bronchospasm via anaphylaxis, but generally **not etiologically linked to asthma**.

##### Irritants

- Many asthmatics report increased symptoms to **strong odors, smoke, combustion products, cleaning fluids, perfumes**.
- Effects generally short-lived, but chronic/large exposures (RADS) can cause long-lasting/permanent symptoms.

##### Viral Infections

- Most asthmatics report exacerbations triggered by **upper respiratory infections**.
- Inflammation can be neutrophilic and eosinophilic.
- IgE generation may reduce interferon production, predisposing to viral effects.
- Increased airway reactivity after viral infections usually persists 4–6 weeks, but can lead to permanent changes/impairment.

##### Exercise and Cold/Dry Air

- **Exercise** can trigger bronchoconstriction.
- **Hyperventilation during exercise dries airway lining**, changing tonicity and causing release of bronchoconstrictive mediators.
- More prominent with lower moisture content/temperature of air.
- Cold air may cause airway edema during rewarming.
- Short-lived at routine exercise levels.

##### Air Pollution

- Increased exacerbations linked to ambient **ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide**.

##### Drugs

- **Beta blockers** may trigger bronchospasm (even ophthalmic).
- **Aspirin** may precipitate bronchospasm in **aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease**.
- **ACE inhibitors** (and less so ARBs) may cause cough.

##### Occupational Exposures

- Episodic/recurrent exposures to workplace irritants/sensitizers can cause symptoms.
- Symptoms usually reduced away from exposure (weekends, vacation).

##### Stress

- Asthmatics may report increased symptoms with stress; mechanisms poorly understood.

##### Hormonal Factors

- Small proportion of women report regular increase in **perimenstrual symptoms**; worsening during perimenopause (related to rapid estrogen fluctuations).
- Pregnancy can precipitate worsening of asthma in ~1/3 of pregnant patients.

#### Comorbidities

- Comorbidities can make asthma difficult to manage.

##### Obesity

- Obese adults with asthma have **more severe symptoms** and are **2-4 times more likely to be hospitalized**.
- Bariatric surgery has shown improvement and significant reduction in exacerbations.

##### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

- Predicts poor quality of life and is an independent predictor of asthma exacerbations.
- Treatment of symptomatic reflux shows modest improvements in airway function, symptoms, exacerbation frequency.
- Treatment of asymptomatic patients shows no benefit.

##### Rhinosinusitis And/Or Nasal Polyposis

- Rhinosinusitis may be a manifestation of eosinophilic inflammation in lower airway.
- Poorly controlled rhinosinusitis aggravates asthma via inflammatory/irritant effects of secretions, neural reflexes, inflammatory mediators/cells.
- Intranasal corticosteroids decrease airway reactivity, ED visits, hospitalizations.
- Surgical therapy inconclusive benefit.
- Biologics targeting Type 2 inflammation may be useful for asthma with rhinosinusitis/polyposis.
- Nasal polyposis rare in children; in adults with asthma, raises suspicion of **aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease**.

##### Vocal Cord Dysfunction

- Also known as **inducible laryngeal obstruction**.
- Involves inappropriate laryngeal narrowing, producing airflow resistance.
- Can complicate and mimic asthma.
- More common in women and patients with anxiety/depression.
- Diagnosis involves laryngoscopy during symptomatic episodes or induced obstruction.

##### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

- Asthma-COPD overlap is not a syndrome, but identifies patients with symptoms due to coexistence of both.

##### Anxiety/Depression

- Increased asthma exacerbations in asthmatics with anxiety, depression, chronic stress.
- Some patients confuse anxiety attacks with asthma.

### Diagnosis and Evaluation

#### Approach

- **Presumptive diagnosis** based on compatible history of recurrent wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, or cough related to common precipitants, with differential diagnoses considered/eliminated.
- Therapeutic trial of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) may be considered.
- Diagnosis should be **confirmed with pulmonary function testing or demonstration of airway hyperresponsiveness** (except in mildest cases).
- Diagnosis can be hard to confirm post-therapy, as obstruction/hyperresponsiveness may be mitigated; medication tapering trial may be needed.
- **More than 1/3 of physician-diagnosed asthma patients don't meet criteria**.
- **Adjunctive evaluation** to identify precipitating factors/mechanisms (e.g., allergen avoidance).
- Cases requiring more than daily moderate-dose ICS/LABA need formal evaluation for comorbidities and confounding diagnoses.

#### Primary Assessment Tools for Establishing a Diagnosis

##### History

- Common complaints: episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, mucus production, or cough upon exposure to triggers.
- Symptoms may be **worse in the morning** or nocturnal.
- Nocturnal symptoms alone should prompt evaluation for postnasal drip or GERD.
- Symptoms often with **rapid temperature/humidity changes**.
- **Exercise-induced symptoms are common**, especially with cold air sensitivity.
- Exercise symptoms develop and resolve slower than cardiac dyspnea unless β2-agonist administered.
- **Careful exposure history**: home (pets, molds, dust, smoke), work (occupational sensitizers), recreational.
- Allergen-sensitized patients report symptoms to known allergens (animals) and seasonal worsening.
- **Up to 2/3 of asthma patients are atopic** (vs. half of US population).
- Almost half have rhinitis history, many with intermittent sinusitis.
- Adult-onset asthma: inquire about occupational history, NSAID reactions, new medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors).

##### Physical Examination

- Between acute attacks: **physical findings may be normal**.
- Many have **allergic rhinitis** (pale nasal mucus membranes).
- **≥5% may have nasal polyps**, more frequent in severe asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.
- Some have **expiratory wheezing** (less inspiratory).
- During acute attack: **tachypnea, tachycardia, accessory muscle use**.
- Wheezing with prolonged expiratory phase common; as obstruction severity increases, chest may become "silent".

##### Pulmonary Function Tests

- Reduction in airway lumen increases airflow resistance, detected as **reduced expiratory airflow**.
- **PEFR, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio reduced** below lower limit of normal.
- Flow-volume loop may show characteristic scalloping.
- Findings may not be present during acute attacks or on therapy.
- **Reversibility**: **≥12% increase in FEV1 and ≥200 mL absolute increase** after β2-agonist (≥15 min) or several weeks of corticosteroid therapy.
- Diurnal peak flow variability >20% suggested as indicator, but less reliable due to quality control/variability.
- **Lung volumes and diffusing capacity should be normal** in uncomplicated asthma.

##### Assessment of Airway Responsiveness

- If PFTs nonconfirmatory and diagnosis doubtful, test for increased reactivity to provocative stimuli.
- **Methacholine** (cholinergic agonist) most common: PD20 ≤400 μg indicates reactivity.
- **Mannitol** and hypertonic saline also used.
- **Exercise and/or cold, dry air challenge**: positive if ≥10% FEV1 drop from baseline.
- Suspected environmental/occupational exposures: specific allergen challenges in specialized labs.

#### Adjunctive Assessment Tools

##### Eosinophil Counts

- Large proportion of patients not treated with oral/high-dose ICSs have **eosinophil counts ≥300 cells/μL**.
- Correlate with disease severity in population studies.
- Presence in severe asthma indicates likelihood of response to **Type 2-targeted medications**.
- Extremely elevated levels prompt consideration of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis or primary eosinophilic disorders.

##### IgE, Skin Tests, and Radioallergosorbent Tests

- **Total serum IgE levels** useful for anti-IgE therapy eligibility.
- Levels >1000 IU/mL suggest ABPA.
- **Skin tests or RAST** (detect IgE to specific antigens) confirm atopy and suggest allergic rhinitis (complicates management).
- Allergy investigations useful in identifying aggravating environmental exposures (when correlated with history).

##### Exhaled Nitric Oxide Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)

- Approximate indicator of **eosinophilic inflammation** in airways.
- Easily suppressed by ICSs, so can assess adherence if initially elevated.
- **Elevated levels (>35–40 ppb)** in untreated patients indicate eosinophilic inflammation.
- **Levels >20–25 ppb** in severe asthma on moderate-to-high-dose ICS indicate poor adherence or persistent Type 2 inflammation.

#### Additional Evaluation in Severe/Poorly Responsive Asthma

- Evaluate for comorbidities (e.g., sinus radiographic studies, esophageal studies).
- In nonreversible disease, **serum α1 antitrypsin level**.

##### Chest Radiography

- **Chest CT** useful for bronchiectasis and other structural abnormalities causing obstruction.
- New image analysis tools assess airway properties (wall thickness, diameter, air trapping).

##### Sputum

- **Induced sputum** in specialized centers to characterize Type 2 (eosinophils) and non–Type 2 (neutrophils) inflammation.
- In severe asthma, some patients may have localized persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation despite normal peripheral eosinophils.

### Treatment

#### Goals of Asthma Therapy and Assessment of Control

- Goals: achieve symptom control and reduce risk (exacerbation frequency).
- Comprehensive approach: **avoiding/reducing triggers** and **adjunctive use of medications**.
- Medications divided into:
    - **Reliever medications**: relax smooth muscle, rapid relief of acute symptoms.
    - **Controller medications**: target inflammation or mediator production.

#### Reducing Triggers

##### Mitigation

- Triggers/exposures can cause and make asthma difficult to control.
- **Removal from offending occupational environment** can result in complete resolution or significant improvement.
- Remediable environmental exposures: secondhand smoke, frequent cannabis combustion products.
- **Removal of pets** clearly associated with symptoms can reduce them.
- **Pest control** (home/school) beneficial in IgE-mediated sensitivity.
- Effect of **dust/mold control** variable; moderate evidence for dust control (mattress/pillowcase covers) in sensitized patients as part of comprehensive strategy.

##### Allergen Immunotherapy

- Reduces IgE-mediated reactions to administered allergens.
- Reduces allergic rhinitis symptoms.
- Variable evidence for effectiveness in isolated asthma.
- Guidelines recommend only for **controlled mild-to-moderate asthma** due to anaphylaxis risk.
- Evidence for sublingual immunotherapy in asthma not substantial.

##### Vaccination

- Respiratory infections are major cause of asthma exacerbations.
- **Strongly advised**: pneumococcal vaccines (both types) and yearly influenza vaccines.
- **COVID-19 vaccination** also advised.

#### Medications

- **Bronchodilators**: relax airway smooth muscle.
    - Classes: β2-agonists, anticholinergics, theophylline.
- **Controller (Anti-Inflammatory/Antimediator) Therapies**: reduce exacerbations and improve long-term control, decreasing need for intermittent bronchodilators.
    - None shown to prevent airway remodeling progression or rapid lung function decline.

##### β2-Agonists

- Available inhaled or oral; activate β2-receptors on airway smooth muscle (and mast cells, but less significant for efficacy).
- G protein–coupled receptors: activate adenyl cyclase to produce cyclic AMP, relaxing smooth muscle.
- **Use**: Primarily inhaled for **relief of bronchospasm** or to **reduce anticipated bronchospasm** (e.g., exercise).
    - Regular use associated with **tachyphylaxis** of bronchoprotective effect and possible increased airway reactivity (more common with specific β2-receptor polymorphism).
    - Frequent **short-acting β-2 agonist (SABA)** use linked to increased asthma mortality, discouraging isolated use without ICS.
- **Short-Acting β2-Agonists (SABAs)**:
    - **Albuterol** (salbutamol) most common.
    - Onset 3–5 min, effects last 4–6 h.
    - Administered by metered-dose inhaler; nebulized solutions for children.
    - Oral forms available but rarely used.
- **Long-Acting β2-Agonists (LABAs)**:
    - Salmeterol and formoterol.
    - ~12-h duration.
    - **Formoterol** has quick onset like SABAs; Salmeterol slower.
    - Used for **prophylaxis of exercise-induced bronchospasm**.
    - **Not recommended for monotherapy in asthma** (unlike COPD); generally restricted to **combination with ICS**.
- **Ultra-Long-Acting β2-Agonists**:
    - Indacaterol, olodaterol, vilanterol (24-h effect).
    - Only used in **combination with ICSs** in asthma.
- **Safety**:
    - Generally specific, but at higher doses: **tremor, tachycardia, palpitations, hypertension**.
    - Promote potassium reentry: high doses can cause **hypokalemia**.
    - Type B lactic acidosis can occur.
    - Increased asthma mortality associated with high-potency β2-agonists in Australia/NZ.
    - Increased β2-agonist use is a **marker of poor asthma control** and linked to increased mortality.
    - Studies have not found severe adverse asthma outcomes when adding LABAs to ICS compared to maintaining ICS dose.

##### Anticholinergics

- Antagonize cholinergic nerve–induced smooth-muscle constriction.
- Designed for less systemic absorption to minimize systemic anticholinergic effects.
- Long-acting agents are **long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs)**.
- **Use**: Short-acting agents alone for acute bronchodilation.
    - Less effective than β2-agonists and slower onset.
- **Safety**: Dry mouth. Higher doses/elderly: acute glaucoma, urinary retention.
    - Numerical (not significant) difference in mortality for African Americans treated with ICS/LAMA vs. ICS/LABA.

##### Theophylline

- Oral compound, increases cyclic AMP by inhibiting phosphodiesterase.
- **Rarely used** due to **narrow therapeutic window, drug-drug interactions, reduced bronchodilation**.

##### Corticosteroids

- **Particularly effective in reducing Type 2 inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness**.
- Mechanism: bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor, translocate to nucleus, inhibit T-cell activation, eosinophil function/migration/proliferation, proinflammatory cytokine elaboration, NF-κB activation; deactivate other proinflammatory pathways.
- **Use**: Reduce airway hyperresponsiveness, improve function, prevent exacerbations, improve symptoms.
- **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICSs)**:
    - **Cornerstone of asthma therapy**; minimize systemic toxicity.
    - Use associated with **decreased asthma mortality**.
    - Generally used **regularly twice daily as first-line for persistent asthma**.
    - Doses increased and combined with LABAs for increasing severity.
    - European guidelines recommend **intermittent use even in intermittent asthma**.
    - Combining with LABAs allows effective control at lower ICS dose.
    - Longer-acting preparations available for once-daily use.
    - Effects noticeable in days, continue over months (majority in first month).
    - **Adherence often poor** (as few as 25% refill prescriptions).
    - Very high doses sometimes used to reduce oral corticosteroid (OCS) requirements.
    - Not all patients respond; most responsive have significant Type 2-mediated asthma.
- **Oral Corticosteroids (OCSs)**:
    - Chronic OCS at lowest possible doses for patients who cannot achieve control without them (due to side effects).
    - Alternate-day dosing preferred.
    - Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis for daily prednisone ≥20 mg.
    - Used to treat **exacerbations** (frequently 40–60 mg/d prednisone for 1–2 weeks).
    - Well absorbed, used for hospitalized patients.
- **Intravenous Corticosteroids**:
    - Frequently used in hospitalized patients; rapid transition to OCS once stable.
- **Intramuscular Corticosteroids**:
    - Intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide used in high-risk, poorly adherent patients.
- **Safety**:
    - **Chronic systemic corticosteroids**: plethora of side effects including **diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts/glaucoma, bruising, weight gain, truncal obesity, hypertension, ulcers, depression, accelerated cardiac risk**.
    - Monitoring and prophylaxis for infection (pneumocystis pneumonia) and bone health needed.
    - Intermittent "bursts" for exacerbations have reduced side effects, but cumulative dose associated with deleterious effects.
    - **ICSs dramatically reduced side effects** vs. OCSs.
    - Higher ICS doses: bruising, accelerated osteoporosis, small increase in glaucoma/cataracts.
    - **Local effects**: thrush (reduced by spacer/gargling), hoarseness (myopathic effect on vocal cords).
    - Rare patients exhibit side effects even at moderate ICS doses.
    - Children may experience **growth suppression**.

##### Leukotriene Modifiers

- Inhibit leukotriene production (zileuton) or action at CysLT1 receptor (montelukast, zafirlukast).
- **Moderately effective**; improve airway function and reduce exacerbations, but **less so than bronchodilators or ICS**.
- Effective in reducing **allergic rhinitis** symptoms.
- **Montelukast** frequently used in children with mild asthma due to ICS growth suppression concerns.
- Montelukast use may decrease due to **safety warnings regarding depression**.
- Effective in **preventing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction** without tachyphylaxis of LABAs.
- **Particularly effective in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease** (characterized by leukotriene overproduction).
- Modest effect as add-on therapy in patients poorly controlled on high-dose ICS/LABA.
- **CysLT1 Antagonists (Montelukast, Zafirlukast)**: Oral, rapid onset (hours), most chronic effectiveness in 1 month.
- **5-Lipoxygenase Inhibition (Zileuton)**: Oral, twice daily.
- **Safety**:
    - Montelukast well tolerated, but **suicidal ideation warning** from FDA.
    - Zileuton increases liver function tests (transaminases) in 3%; intermittent monitoring suggested. Inhibits CYP1A2, requires dose adjustments for concomitant meds.

##### Cromolyn Sodium

- Inhaled agent, believed to **stabilize mast cells**.
- Only available by nebulization, 2-4 times daily administration.
- Mild to modestly effective, helpful for **exercise-induced bronchospasm**.
- Primarily used in pediatrics due to ICS side effect concerns.

##### Anti-IgE

- **Omalizumab**: monoclonal antibody to Fc portion of IgE, prevents IgE binding to mast cells/basophils.
- Blocks antigen-related signaling by reducing free IgE.
- Reduces IgE production via feedback mechanisms.
- Increases interferon production in rhinovirus infections, decreases viral-induced exacerbations, reduces duration/peak viral shedding (due to IgE's ability to reduce interferon γ production).
- **Use**: Tested in patients with circulating IgE ≥30 IU/mL and positive skin test/RAST to perennial allergen.
    - Generally used in patients **unresponsive to moderate-to-high-dose ICS/LABA**.
    - Reduces exacerbations by **25–50%**, can reduce symptoms, minimal effect on lung function.
    - Dosed by body weight/circulating IgE; administered subcutaneously every 2–4 weeks.
    - Max dose 300 mg every 2 weeks (restricts to body weight ≤150 kg in US).
    - Most effects seen in 3–6 months.
    - Greatest response (exacerbation reduction) in patients with FeNO ≥20 ppb or circulating eosinophils ≥260/μL.
    - FeNO slightly reduced, but circulating IgE unaffected (measures total, not free IgE).
- **Safety**: Low incidence of side effects; **anaphylaxis reported in 0.2%**.

##### IL-5–Active Drugs

- **Mepolizumab** and **reslizumab** bind to IL-5; **benralizumab** binds to IL-5 receptor.
- Rapidly (within a day) reduce circulating eosinophils.
- **Use**: For patients symptomatic on moderate-to-high-dose ICS/LABA, generally ≥2 OCS-requiring exacerbations/year, and **eosinophil count ≥300/μL**.
    - Reduce exacerbations by ~50% or more.
    - FEV1 and symptoms improve moderately.
    - Less effective with eosinophil counts <300/μL if not on chronic OCS.
    - Effective in reducing chronic OCS need regardless of eosinophil count (presumed Type 2 inflammation suppressed by OCS).
    - FeNO and IgE relatively unaffected.
    - Most clinical effects seen within 3–6 months.
- **Safety**: Minimal side effects. Mepolizumab and benralizumab approved for home administration.

##### Anti–IL-4/13

- **Dupilumab** binds to IL-4 receptor α (common subunit for IL-4 and IL-13 receptors), blocking signaling through both.
- **Use**: Effective in patients responsive to anti–IL-5 therapies, and poorly controlled patients on moderate-to-high-dose ICS/LABA with **FeNO of 20–25 ppb**, even if peripheral eosinophils not elevated.
    - Reduces exacerbations by **≥50%**, decreases symptoms, may have more effect on FEV1 than anti–IL-5 drugs.
    - Gradually reduces FeNO and IgE levels.
    - Paradoxically, circulating eosinophil counts may initially temporarily increase.
    - Most effects seen by 3–6 months.
- **Safety**: Minimal side effects, but cases of **serious systemic eosinophilia** associated with OCS reduction noted.
- Approved for home administration and atopic dermatitis.

##### Bronchial Thermoplasty, Alternative Therapies, and Therapies Under Development

- **Bronchial Thermoplasty**: Radiofrequency ablation of airway smooth muscle in major airways (3 bronchoscopies) for severe asthma.
    - Some evidence for reducing exacerbations in select patients.
    - Significant morbidity; most guidelines do not recommend outside clinical trials/registries.
- **Alternative Therapies**: Acupuncture and yoga **not shown to improve asthma** in controlled trials. Placebo studies show significant response.
- **Therapies in Development**: Targeting TSLP, IL-33, CRTH2.
    - Studies targeting IL-17 and TNF-α not shown efficacy.
    - Proof-of-concept studies targeting mast cells via tyrosine kinase inhibition suggest efficacy in severe asthma.

### Approach to the Patient

- US (NAEPP) and WHO (GINA) guidelines advise a symptomatic approach after addressing triggers, exposures, and comorbidities.
- **Adherence and inhaler technique** must be addressed (cause of poor control in up to 50% of referrals).
- **Stepwise approach** for intensifying/reducing therapy, based on control criteria.
- Assuming comorbidities addressed, adherence evaluated, education on trigger avoidance performed, and inhaler technique verified: **cornerstone is intensification of ICS therapy with LABA** for greater control at lower ICS doses.
- Major change in stepwise approach: **as-needed ICS can be used instead of regular ICS in milder asthma**.
- Trigger for as-needed use: patient perception of need for reliever inhaler.
- **ICS/formoterol** as a single agent:
    - As needed without background in milder asthma.
    - As needed in addition to twice daily ICS/formoterol in more severe asthma.
- GINA recommends **ICS/formoterol as the reliever in all steps** (including intermittent asthma, Step 1) due to mortality risk even in mild asthma.
- NAEPP recommends ICS/formoterol as reliever for Step 3 and 4, and as-needed concomitant ICS and SABA for Step 2.
- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs)** are alternatives in Step 2, possibly less appealing now due to montelukast warnings.
- Leukotriene modifiers and long-acting anticholinergics are possible add-on therapies for Step 4 and/or 5.
- **Biologics** are effective in specific endotypes but high cost relegates them to Step 5 or beyond.

### Treatment of Asthma Attacks

- Mild to moderate deteriorations initially treated with **β2-agonist up to every 1 hour**.
- **Increasing ICS dose by 4–5 fold** may be helpful.
- If inadequate control and hourly β2-agonists needed for several hours, refer for urgent care.
- Urgent care: assess PEFR or FEV1, treat with **nebulized β2-agonists up to every 20 min**.
- PEFR >60% predicted often respond to β2-agonists alone.
- If no response in 1–2 hours, **intravenous corticosteroids**.
- **Supplemental oxygen** for hypoxemia.
- LTRA and magnesium sometimes given.
- **Nebulized anticholinergics** for additional bronchodilation.
- Failure to achieve PEFR >60% or persistent severe tachypnea over 4–6 hours suggests hospitalization.
- In-hospital treatment: continuous bronchodilator nebulization.
- **Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation** to prevent intubation; helium-oxygen mixtures to decrease work of breathing.
- Antibiotics only if signs of infection.
- **Mechanical ventilation** difficult in status asthmaticus due to high pressures/resistance.
- Most attacks: hypocapnia due to high respiratory rate.
- **Normal or near-normal PCO2 with respiratory distress is concern for impending respiratory failure** and need for mechanical ventilation.
- Mechanical ventilation aims for low respiratory rates/volumes to decrease peak airway pressures.
- Can achieve via **"permissive hypercapnia"** (allowing PCO2 to rise) and temporarily correcting acidosis with fluids.
- Neuromuscular paralysis may be beneficial.
- Bronchoscopy to clear mucus plugs described, but risky with ventilation difficulties.

### Special Considerations

#### High-Risk Asthma Patients

- 3,000-4,000 asthma deaths annually in US.
- Characteristics of high-risk patients should be considered in evaluation/treatment.

#### Exercise-Induced Symptoms

- Degree of exercise intolerance may reflect poor asthma control.
- Treatment involves step therapy.
- If asthma otherwise controlled:
    - Start with lower exercise levels (warming up), use mask in colder weather.
    - **Pretreatment with SABA** increases bronchoconstriction threshold.
    - LABAs extend protection, but monotherapy discouraged.
    - For occasional exercise, ICS/LABA can be used (regular use exposes to unnecessary ICS).
    - For regular exercise, **LTRAs may provide protection**.
    - SABA (or ICS/formoterol) always available for quick relief.
- Exercise-induced airway narrowing in elite athletes may be related to **direct epithelial injury**. Conditioning incoming air and ipratropium may help.

#### Pregnancy

- Asthma may improve, deteriorate, or remain unchanged.
- **Poor control, especially exacerbations, linked to poor fetal outcomes**.
- General management principles and goals unchanged.
- **Avoidance of triggers (smoking environments)** is critical.
- Extensive experience suggests **safety of inhaled albuterol, beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone**, with reassuring data on formoterol and salmeterol.
- Animal studies no toxicity for montelukast, zafirlukast, omalizumab, ipratropium.
- Antibodies cross placenta; few human data on IL-5–active drugs or anti–IL-4Rα safety.
- Chronic OCS use linked to neonatal adrenal insufficiency, preeclampsia, low birth weight, slight increase in cleft palate.
- **Poorly controlled asthma in pregnancy carries greater risk to fetus/mother than these effects**.
- No hesitancy in routine pharmacotherapy for acute exacerbations.
- **Not recommended**: initiation of allergen immunotherapy or omalizumab during pregnancy.
- Avoid **PGF2-α** if prostaglandins needed for pregnancy management (associated with bronchoconstriction).

#### Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease

- **5–10% of patients** present in adulthood with **difficult-to-control asthma, Type 2 inflammation with eosinophilia, sinusitis, nasal polyposis, severe exacerbations precipitated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors (e.g., aspirin)**.
- Patients **overproduce leukotrienes** in response to COX-1 inhibition (likely due to PGE2 inhibition).
- Should **avoid COX-1 inhibitors** (aspirin, NSAIDs) but generally tolerate COX-2 inhibitors and acetaminophen.
- Treated with **leukotriene modifiers**.
- **Aspirin desensitization** can decrease upper respiratory symptoms and allow chronic aspirin/NSAID use.
- **Dupilumab and IL-5–active biologics are particularly helpful** and superseding aspirin desensitization unless chronic aspirin/NSAID is medically required.

#### Severe Asthma

- **~5–10% of asthma**; defined as uncontrolled on Step 5 therapy, or requiring it for control, after appropriate evaluation.
- Can account for almost **50% of asthma care cost** in US.
- Significant proportion have issues with **adherence and/or inhaler technique**.
- Almost half have evidence of **persistent eosinophilic inflammation** (peripheral blood eosinophils and/or induced sputum).
- Recurrent exacerbations: substantially increased likelihood of responding to **Type 2 targeted biologics**.
- Treatment for mixed, isolated neutrophilic, or pauci-granulocytic inflammation is unclear.
- Some data suggest aberrations in resolution of inflammation pathways.
- Rare patients may have biochemical abnormalities interfering with steroid response.
- **Macrolides are useful in a subset**.
- Studies targeting mast cells, IL-6, IL-33, and other pathways are underway.
- Therapies for pro-resolving pathways promising.

#### Elderly Patients with Asthma

- Asthma can present or persist into older age.
- Mortality in those >65 is **five times greater** than younger cohorts, even adjusting for comorbidities.
- Many had childhood asthma with quiescent periods.
- New-onset asthma: almost half were current/former smokers; 1/4 due to occupational exposure.
- Patients with **eosinophilic inflammation** appear to have more severe asthma.
- May need adjustment to step therapy due to **intolerance of β2-agonist** (arrhythmia, tremulousness).
- Coexistence of COPD needs careful consideration.

#### Asthma-COPD Overlap

- Not a syndrome, but useful to identify patients with airway dysfunction from **simultaneous coexistence of asthma and COPD**.
- Smoking can **blunt response to ICS**.
- Difficult to demonstrate effectiveness of Type 2 biologics in COPD patients despite ≥300 circulating eosinophils/μL.
- Earlier initiation of **anticholinergics** may be considered in patients with both diseases.

# Pleural effusion 
* space between lung and chest wall 
* contains some fluid as ***Coupling system*** 
* effusion if excess fluid 
## Etiology 
* formation > absorption 
	* enters via 
		* capillary of parietal pleura
		* interstitial spaces of the lung via the visceral pleura
		* peritoneal cavity via small holes in the diaphragm.
	*  removed by lymphatics (20x removal capacity available usually )
## Diagnostic Approach 
* chest imaging for extent 
* USG > lateral decubitus Xray as it also gives guide to thoracocentesis 
* effort to determine cause 
* Transudate vs exudates 
	* 1st step 
* Transudative 
	* systemic factors that influence the formation and absorption of pleural fluid are altered. The leading causes of transudative pleural are left ventricular failure and cirrhosis.

# Pleural effusion 
* space between lung and chest wall 
* contains some fluid as ***Coupling system*** 
* effusion if excess fluid 
## Etiology 
* formation > absorption 
	* enters via 
		* capillary of parietal pleura
		* interstitial spaces of the lung via the visceral pleura
		* peritoneal cavity via small holes in the diaphragm.
	*  removed by lymphatics (20x removal capacity available usually )
## Diagnostic Approach 
* chest imaging for extent 
* USG > lateral decubitus Xray as it also gives guide to thoracocentesis 
* effort to determine cause 
* Transudate vs exudates 
	* 1st step 
	* LDH and protein in fluid 
	* at least one of the following criteria (Lights) , exudative 
		1. Pleural fluid protein/serum protein >0.5
    	2. Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH >0.6
	    3. Pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds the normal upper limit for serum 
	* May misclassify 25% transudate as exudative 
	* if criteria ++, measure serum and fluid protein gradient 
		* if >3.1g/dL 
* Transudative 
	* systemic factors are altered.
	* The leading causes of transudative pleural are left ventricular failure and cirrhosis.
* Exudative 
	* local factors 
	* bacterial pneumonia , malignancy , viral and pulmonary embolism 
	* additional diagnosis to find cause

# Pleural effusion 
* space between lung and chest wall 
* contains some fluid as ***Coupling system*** 
* effusion if excess fluid 
## Etiology 
* formation > absorption 
	* enters via 
		* capillary of parietal pleura
		* interstitial spaces of the lung via the visceral pleura
		* peritoneal cavity via small holes in the diaphragm.
	*  removed by lymphatics (20x removal capacity available usually )
## Diagnostic Approach 
* chest imaging for extent 
* USG > lateral decubitus Xray as it also gives guide to thoracocentesis 
* effort to determine cause 
* Transudate vs exudates 
	* 1st step 
	* LDH and protein in fluid 
	* at least one of the following criteria (Lights) , exudative 
		1. Pleural fluid protein/serum protein >0.5
    	2. Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH >0.6
	    3. Pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds the normal upper limit for serum 
	* May misclassify 25% transudate as exudative 
	* if criteria ++, measure serum and fluid protein gradient 
		* if >3.1g/dL , classify as transudate 
* Transudative 
	* systemic factors are altered.
	* The leading causes of transudative pleural are left ventricular failure and cirrhosis.
* Exudative 
	* local factors 
	* bacterial pneumonia , malignancy , viral and pulmonary embolism 
	* additional diagnosis to find cause 
		* appearance 
		* glucose 
		* DLC 
		* microbiology 
		* cytology 
## Effusion due to heart failure 
* most common cause is LVF 
* increased amounts of fluid in the lung interstitial spaces exit in part across the visceral pleura; 
* overwhelms the capacity of the lymphatics in the parietal pleura 
* Thoracocentesis only if 
	* unilateral 
	* unequal size 
	* febrile 
	* pleuritic chest pain 
	* persistent despite therapy 
* Pleural fluid N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level >1500 pg/mL is virtually diagnostic 
## HEPATIC hydrothorax 
* predominant mechanism is the direct movement of peritoneal fluid through small openings in the diaphragm into the pleural space. 
* The effusion is usually right-sided  
* large enough to produce severe dyspnea.
## Parapneumonic Effusion 
* associated with bacterial pneumonia, lung abscess, or bronchiectasis 
* probably the most common cause of exudative pleural effusion
* if gross pus --> ***empyema*** 
* Clinical 
	* bacterial 
		* acute febrile illness consisting of chest pain, sputum production, and leukocytosis. 
	* anaerobic 
		* subacute illness
		* weight loss, a brisk leukocytosis, mild anemia,
		* history of some factor that predisposes them to aspiration
* Consider  in bacterial pneumonia 
* if lung to chest wall separation >10mm, therapeutic thoracocentesis 
* Chest tube indication (increasing importance)
	* Loculated pleural fluid  
	* Pleural fluid pH <7.20  
	* Pleural fluid glucose <3.3 mmol/L (<60 mg/dL)
	* Positive Gram stain or culture of the pleural fluid 
	* Presence of gross pus in the pleural space
* repeat if recurs 
* if incomplete removal 
	* consider chest tube with fibrinolytic agent (tPA 10mg) and deoxyribonuclease (5mg) or
	* thoracoscopy and adhesiolysis 
	* decortication if ineffective 
## Effusion secondary to malignancy 
* 2nd most common 
* tumor 
	* lung ca
	* breast ca 
	* lymphoma 
* dyspnea out of proportion to size of effusion 
* exudative with low glucose 
* cytology 
	* if negative then thoracoscopy 
	* pleural abrasion for pleurodesis during procedure 
	* can do CT/USG guided needle biopsy of pleural thickening 
* treat symptomatic as usually implies mets and not much treatment available 
* if thoracocentesis improves dyspnea 
	* small indwelling catheter insertion 
	* tube thoracotomy with sclerosant like doxycycline 500mg 
## Mesothelioma 
* primary tumour from mesothelial cells 
* asbestos exposure 
* chest pain and shortness of breath 
* pleural effusion 
* pleural thickening 
* shrunken hemithorax 
## Secondary to Pulmonary Embolization
* overlooked diagnosis 
* dyspnea 
* exudative 
* spiral CT or pulmonary arteriography 
* manage as pulmonary embolism 
* if increase size despite therapy 
	* recurrent embolism 
	* hemothorax 
	* pleural infection 
## TB pleuritis 
* exudative with small lymphocytosis 
* associated with primary TB 
* primarily to a hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculous protein in the pleural space. 
* present with
	* fever, 
	* weight loss, 
	* dyspnea
	* pleuritic chest pain 
* high TB markers in fluid 
	* ADA >40 
	* IFN-gamma >140 
	* cultures 
	* needle biopsy 
	* thoracoscopy 
## Secondary to Viral Infections 
* for undiagnosed effusion 
* resolve spontaneous with no residual 
## Chylothorax
* thoracic duct disrupted 
* ***chyle*** in pleural space 
* cause 
	* trauma (most common) --> most commonly due to thoracic surgery 
	* mediastinal tumours
* dyspnea + large pleural effusion 
* ***milky fluid + TGs > 110 mg/dL*** on fluid analysis 
* if no obvious trauma 
	* lymphangiogram 
	* mediastinal CT 
* Manage with ***chest tube + octreotide*** (prolonged chest tube may cause malnutrition and immune incompetence )
* if fails, ***percutaneous transabdominal thoracic duct blockage*** 
* alternate is duct ligation 
## Hemothorax 
* if blood in fluid 
* obtain ***hematocrit >0.5 of blood --> hemothorax*** 
* causes 
	* trauma 
	* vessel rupture 
	* tumor rupture 
* tube thoracostomy (chest tube) --> quantification 
* if laceration of pleura--> appose the surfaces 
* if >***200ml***/h --> ***angiographic coil embolisation*** 
## Miscellaneous
* if amylase raised --> esophagus rupture or pancreas 
* febrile + PMNs + no parenchymal abnormalities --> abdominal abcess 
* Asbestos --> diagnosis of exclusion 
* Meigs Syndrome 
	* Benign ovarian tumors can produce ascites and a pleural effusion 
	* also in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome 
	* post bypass 
		* early (first few weeks) --> left sided and bloody , eosinophilic + and respond to thoracocentesis 
		* late are left sided, yellow, small lymphos and recur

# Pneumothorax 
* presence of gas in the pleural space. 
* Spontaneous pneumothorax
	* is one that occurs without antecedent trauma to the thorax. 
## **Primary spontaneous pneumothorax*** 
* occurs in the absence of underlying lung disease 
* rupture of ***apical pleural blebs***
	* small cystic spaces that lie within or immediately under the visceral pleura. 
* occur almost exclusively in smokers (imply underlying disease )
* 1/2 have recurrence 
* initial --> simple aspiration 
* if no expansion by aspiration / recurrent 
	* thoracoscopy + blep stapling 
	* + pleural abrasion 
## Secondary 
* occurs in presence of lung disease 
* due to COPD most commonly 
* more life-threatening as low pulmonary reserves 
* treat with tube thoracostomy 
	* add thoracoscopy or thoracostomy + stapling and abrasion 
* if surgery not possible 
	* Pleurodesis 
## Traumatic 
* penetrating or non penetrating both
* tube thoracostomy (unless very small )
* if ***hemopneumothorax***
	* one chest tube should be placed in the ***superior part*** of the hemithorax to evacuate the air 
	* Second should be placed in ***the inferior*** part of the hemithorax to remove the blood.
* Iatrogenic become more common 
	* manage with oxygen and aspiration 
	* if fails tube thoracostomy 
## Tension 
* during mechanical ventilation or resuscitation 
* Positive pleural pressure 
	* life-threatening 
	* ventilation compromised 
	* pressure transmitted to mediastinum, reducing cardiac output 
* suggested by 
	* difficult ventilation in resuscitation 
	* high ***Peak inspiratory pressure*** 
* enlarged hemitho

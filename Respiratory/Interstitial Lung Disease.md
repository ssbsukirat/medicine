* parenchymal lung diseases include a large number (>200) of heterogeneous conditions that affect the lung parenchyma with varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis 
* Interstitial space is dominant site in ILD 
* alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells play role in pathogenesis 
* reports of progressive exertional dyspnea or a persistent dry cough.
* for diagnosis clinical, lab , pft, imaging, hpe all required together
* usually divided as Known vs unknown causes 
* Known 
	* occupational exposure (asbestosis)
	* drugs (nitrofurantoin)
	* underlying systemic disease (cryptogenic oragnising pneumonia in polymyositis)
* Unknown 
	* rare disorders with classic presentation (spontaneous pneumothorax in LAM )
	* Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIPs)
 * Granulomatous 
	* both known (HSP) and unknown 
	  (sarcoidosis)

# Diagnostic approach 
* evaluation for alternate causes especially 
	* CVS disease 
	* diffuse infections 
	* malignancy

* Sex 
	* LAM in young women 
	* CTD -associated more in women 
		* ***except RA*** 
	* IPF and occupation related more in men 
* Duration of symptoms

	* antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone),

## Lung biopsy 
* Fiberoptic bronchoscopic 
	* serial lavage fluid can be helpful in establishing ***DAH***, which can be present in ILDs with vasculitis (e.g., GPA),
	* cellular examination can suggest a specific diagnosis (eosinophilia >25% in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia or fat globules in macrophages in lipoid pneumonia).
	* granulomatous diagnosis 
	* felt to be insufficient to diagnose most of the IIPs 
* Surgical biopsy

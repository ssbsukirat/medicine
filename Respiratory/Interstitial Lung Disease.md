* parenchymal lung diseases include a large number (>200) of heterogeneous conditions that affect the lung parenchyma with varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis 
* Interstitial space is dominant site in ILD 
* alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells play role in pathogenesis 
* reports of progressive exertional dyspnea or a persistent dry cough.
* for diagnosis clinical, lab , pft, imaging, hpe all required together
* usually divided as Known vs unknown causes 
* Known 
	* occupational exposure (asbestosis)
	* drugs (nitrofurantoin)
	* underlying systemic disease (cryptogenic oragnising pneumonia in polymyositis)
* Unknown 
	* rare disorders with classic presentation (spontaneous pneumothorax in LAM )
	* Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIPs)
 * Granulomatous 
	* both known (HSP) and unknown 
	  (sarcoidosis)

# Diagnostic approach 
* evaluation for alternate causes especially 
	* CVS disease 
	* diffuse infections 
	* malignancy 
## History 
* Age 
	* more in >60 
	* rare <50 
	* if >65 without strong alternate diagnosis , atypical CT likely to be UIP 
	* between 20-40
		* sarcoidosis , CTD-associated, LAM , pulmonary lagerhan cell histiocytosis
* Sex 
	* LAM in young women 
	* CTD -associated more in women 
		* ***except RA*** 
	* IPF and occupation related more in men 
* Duration of symptoms 
	* acute presentation rare 
		* misdiagnosed as pneumonia , COPD, Heart failure 
		* in eosinophilic pneumonia , acute interstitial pneumonia , HP, Granulomatosis with polyangitis 
	* chronic course common 
	* subacute 
		* sarcoidosis 
		* CTD-associated 
		* drug induce 
		* COP 
* Respiratory symptoms 
	* progressive dyspnea on exertion 
	* dry cough (IPF)
	* sarcoidosis and HP with cough 
	* cough with hemoptysis 
		* diffuse alveolar hemorrhage 
		  (goodpastures)
		* GPA 
		* LAM 
		* secondary pulmonary infections 
	* chest pain rare 
		* sarcoidosis maybe ++
	* fatigue seen in all 
* Past medical history 
	* history of CTD or similar eg raynauds phenomenon 
	* ILD can be initial presentation of CTD 
	* malignancy history 
		* dermatomyositis associated COP 
		* sarcoid like reaction 
	* eosinophilic GPA 
		* asthma 
		* allergic rhinitis 
* Medications 
	* medications commonly used to treat inflammatory and granulomatous lung disease are also associated with ILD development (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, rituximab, and the tumor necrosis factor α–blocking agents)
	* antibiotics (e.g., nitrofurantoin), 
	* antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone), 
	* antineoplastic agents (e.g., bleomycin)
* Family history 
	* presence of a close relative with an IIP is among the strongest risk factors for IPF. 
	* familial aggregation of diverse forms of IIP (such as IPF, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and DIP running in the same family)
	* MUC5B mucin promoter gene in pulmonary fibrosis also TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) associated with both familial and idiopathic 
* Social 
	* smoking 
		* respiratory bronchiolitis 
		* DIP desquamative interstitial pneumonia -- causative  
		* IPF 
## Physical 
* end inspiration fine crackles at lung bases 
* rales non specific 
* wheeze uncommon 
* advanced disease 
	* cyanosis 
	* clubbing 
	* cor pulmonale 
## Laboratory 
* underlying CTD 
* +/- cost effective 
## Pulmonary function tests 
* restrictive pattern in most 
* reduced TLC, FEV1, FVC 
* DLCO low 
* FEV1/FVC reduction uncommon 
* characterize extent of disease 
* decline on repeated testing is rate of mortality 
## Chest Imaging 
* CXRAY 
	* sarcoidosis 
		* enlarged hilar lymph nodes and a pattern of central nodular opacities in the mid to upper lung zones
	* IPF 
		* basilar reticular pattern, with small cystic spaces, in the absence of clinical evidence for heart failure 
* Chest CT 
	* standard of care in the initial evaluation of a patient with a suspected ILD. 
	* helps to define the extent of the ILD, 
	* determine the presence of more concerning features suggestive of advanced disease (e.g., honeycombing), 
	* provide information on coexisting diseases (e.g., emphysema and lung cancer)
	* location for biopsy 
## Lung biopsy 
* Fiberoptic bronchoscopic 
	* serial lavage fluid can be helpful in establishing ***DAH***, which can be present in ILDs with vasculitis (e.g., GPA),
	* cellular examination can suggest a specific diagnosis (eosinophilia >25% in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia or fat globules in macrophages in lipoid pneumonia).
	* granulomatous diagnosis 
	* felt to be insufficient to diagnose most of the IIPs 
* Surgical biopsy 
	* VATS vs open 
	* diagnostic yield of biopsies tends to be higher if obtained prior to treatment 
	* mortality with pr

* parenchymal lung diseases include a large number (>200) of heterogeneous conditions that affect the lung parenchyma with varying degrees of inflammation and fibrosis 
* Interstitial space is dominant site in ILD 
* alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells play role in pathogenesis 
* reports of progressive exertional dyspnea or a persistent dry cough.
* for diagnosis clinical, lab , pft, imaging, hpe all required together
* usually divided as Known vs unknown causes 
* Known 
	* occupational exposure (asbestosis)
	* drugs (nitrofurantoin)
	* underlying systemic disease (cryptogenic oragnising pneumonia in polymyositis)
* Unknown 
	* rare disorders with classic presentation (spontaneous pneumothorax in LAM )
	* Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIPs)
 * Granulomatous 
	* both known (HSP) and unknown 
	  (sarcoidosis)

* ![[ILD-class.png]]
# Diagnostic approach 
* evaluation for alternate causes especially 
	* CVS disease 
	* diffuse infections 
	* malignancy 
## History 
* Age 
	* more in >60 
	* rare <50 
	* if >65 without strong alternate diagnosis , atypical CT likely to be UIP 
	* between 20-40
		* sarcoidosis , CTD-associated, LAM , pulmonary lagerhan cell histiocytosis
* Sex 
	* LAM in young women 
	* CTD -associated more in women 
		* ***except RA*** 
	* IPF and occupation related more in men 
* Duration of symptoms 
	* acute presentation rare 
		* misdiagnosed as pneumonia , COPD, Heart failure 
		* in eosinophilic pneumonia , acute interstitial pneumonia , HP, Granulomatosis with polyangitis 
	* chronic course common 
	* subacute 
		* sarcoidosis 
		* CTD-associated 
		* drug induce 
		* COP 
* Respiratory symptoms 
	* progressive dyspnea on exertion 
	* dry cough (IPF)
	* sarcoidosis and HP with cough 
	* cough with hemoptysis 
		* diffuse alveolar hemorrhage 
		  (goodpa)
		* GPA 
		* LAM

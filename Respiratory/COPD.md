* Disease state characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction
* includes 
	* ***Emphysema***
		* ***anatomically*** defined condition with destruction of the lung alveoli with air space enlargement; 
	* ***chronic bronchitis***, 
		* a ***clinically*** defined condition with chronic cough and phlegm; and/or 
	* ***small airway disease***, 
		* a condition in which small bronchioles are narrowed and reduced in number
* Classic definition 
	* requires the presence of chronic airflow obstruction, determined by spirometry
* All 3 forms present in varying degrees in different patients 
* May have either of 3 without airflow obstruction so cant be defined as COPD but similar process 
* ***COPDGene*** study recently proposed a multidimensional approach to COPD diagnosis, which is based on domains of 
	* environmental exposures, 
	* respiratory symptoms, 
	* imaging abnormalities, 
	* physiologic abnormalities.
# Pathogenesis 
* Airflow obstruction may be from airway disease or emphysema 
* Small airways may become narrowed by 
	* cells (hyperplasia and accumulation), 
	* mucus 
	* fibrosis,
* extensive small airway destruction has been demonstrated to be a ***hallmark*** of COPD.
* Pulmonary vascular destruction occurs in concert with small airway disease and emphysema 
* Pathogenesis paradigm consists of 4 interrelated events 
	* Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke in genetically susceptible individuals triggers inflammatory and immune cell recruitment within large and small airways and in the terminal air spaces of the lung.
	* Inflammatory cells release proteinases that damage the extracellular matrix supporting airways, vasculature, and gas exchange surfaces of the lungs 
	* Structural cell death occurs through oxidant-induced damage, cellular senescence, and proteolytic loss of cellular-matrix attachments leading to extensive loss of smaller airways, vascular pruning, and alveolar destruction 
	* Disordered repair of elastin and other extracellular matrix components contributes to air space enlargement and emphysema.
## Inflammation and extracellular matrix proteolysis 
* Elastin is principle component of elastic fibres and highly stable, crucial to integrity of lung 
* ***elastase:antielastase hypothesis***
	* the balance of elastin-degrading enzymes and their inhibitors determines the susceptibility of the lung to destruction, resulting in air space enlargement
	* Based on genetic deficiency in α1 antitrypsin (***α1AT***), the inhibitor of the serine proteinase neutrophil elastase, were at increased risk of emphysema, and that instillation of elastases, including neutrophil elastase, into experimental animals results in emphysema
* complex network of immune and inflammatory cells and additional biological mechanisms that contribute to emphysema have subsequently been identified
* ![[COPDpathogen.png]]
* Autoimmune mechanism may promote progression of disease 
* In end-stage lung disease, long after smoking cessation, there remains an exuberant inflammatory cells suggesting that cigarette smoke–induced inflammation both initiates the disease and, in susceptible individuals, establishes a chronic process that can continue disease progression even after smoking cessation. 
* Cell Death 
	* variety of mechanism 
		* ceramide production 
		* Rtp801 inhibition of mTOR 
	* Emphysema is premature aging of lung 
	* hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) is gene involved 
* Ineffective repair 
	* Limited repair ability 
	* Cigarette smoke blocks macrophage uptake of apoptotic cells, blocking Growth factor production 
	* Septation is responsible for alveologenesis in lung development and cannot be reinitiated 

# Pathology 
* Affects large airway, small airway (<_ 2mm) and alveoli 
* Large airway 
	* cough 
	* sputum production 
* Small and alveoli 
	* physiological alterations 
* airway inflammation , destruction and emphysema are present in most as independent process 
* Early COPD has mostly small and medium airway disease 
* GOLD 1/2 have almost no emphysema 
* GOLD 3/4 have emphysema though maybe absent in some 
* greatest risk of progression in COPD are those with both aggressive airway disease and emphysema.
* Emphysema on CT either early or late suggests enhanced disease progression risk

## large airway 
* smoking causes mucus gland enlargement  and goblet cell hyperplasia (in number and extent) --> cough and mucus production --> chronic bronchitis 
* Squamous metaplasia of bronchi --> carcinogenesis risk + mucociliary clearance disrupted 
* smooth muscle hypertrophy + bronchial hypersensitivity leading to obstruction 
* Neutrophil influx causes purulent sputum during respiratory tract infections
* neutrophil elastase is among the most potent secretagogue 
## Small airway (<_ 2mm)
* major site of increased resistance 
* goblet cell metaplasia, with these mucus-secreting cells replacing surfactant-secreting Club cells 
* Smooth-muscle hypertrophy 
* Luminal narrowing by 
	* fibrosis, 
	* excess mucus, 
	* edema, 
	* cellular infiltration 
	* reduced surfactant increasing surface tension
* Narrowing and drop-out of small airways before emphysematous destruction 
## Lung parenchyma 
* destruction of gas-exchanging air spaces 
	* respiratory bronchioles, 
	* alveolar ducts,
	* alveoli
* alveolar spaces in smokers have 
	* macrophage 
	* neutrophil 
	* B & T lymphos 
	* CD8+
* Emphysema types 
	* centrilobular 
		* m/c with smoke 
		* initially close to respiratory bronchioles 
		* upper lobe and superior segment of lower 
		* focal 
	* panlobular 
		* evenly within and across acinar units 
		* α1AT deficiency,
		* lower lobes 
	* paraseptal 
		* pleural margins 
		* 10-15% 
		* sparing of core and central regions 
* ![[COPDemphysematypes.png]]

## Hyperinflation 
* "air trapping"
	* increased residual volume 
	* increased ratio of residual to total lung volume 
* Progressive hyperinflation ( increased TLC )
* preserves maximum expiratory airflow, because as lung volume increases, elastic recoil pressure increases, and airways enlarge so that airway resistance decreases 
* Pushes diaphragm into flat position 
	* zone of apposition reduces, positive abdominal pressure during inspiration is not applied as effectively to the chest wall, hindering rib cage movement and impairing inspiration
	* shortens muscle fibres --> less capable of generating inspiratory pressures than normal
	* must generate greater tension to develop the transpulmonary pressure required to produce tidal breathing
	* thoracic cage is distended beyond its normal resting volume, the inspiratory muscles must do work to overcome the resistance of the thoracic cage
## Gas exchange 
* Pao2 remains normal till FEV1 < 50% 
* Paco2 not elevated till FEV1 <25% 
* PAH severe to cause cor pulmonale and right ventricular failure due to COPD in FEV1 (<25% of predicted) and chronic hypoxemia (Pao2 <55 mmHg)
* Nonuniform ventilation and ventilation-perfusion mismatching 
* multiple parenchymal compartments having different rates of ventilation due to regional differences
* pao2 reduction due to V/Q mismatching 
* minimal shunting 

# Risk Factor 
## Cigarette smoking 
* accelerated decline in FEV1 in a dose-response relationship to the intensity of cigarette smoking 
	* accounts for higher prevalence rates of COPD with increasing age
* typically expressed as pack-years 
	* average number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the total number of years of smoking 
* considerable individual variability in the response to smoking. 
* Pack-years of cigarette smoking is the most highly significant predictor of FEV1 (but only 15% impact explained)
* dditional environmental and/ or genetic factors contribute to the impact of smoking
* even if smoker has normal spirometry 
	* worse health-related quality of life,
	* reduced exercise capacity,
	* emphysema and/or airway disease on chest CT evaluation
* Cigar and pipe less compelling evidence 
	* related to the lower dose of inhaled tobacco by-products

## Airway responsiveness 
* Many patients share responsiveness with asthma 
* considerable overlap between persons with a history of chronic asthma and smokers with COPD in older subjects specially 
* share common environmental and genetic factors and the chronic form in older subjects can present similarly.
* increased airway responsiveness is clearly a significant predictor of subsequent decline in pulmonary function 

## Respiratory infections 
* significant long-term reductions in pul- monary function are not typically seen following an individual episode of acute bronchitis or pneumonia 
* respiratory infections are important causes of COPD exacerbations 
* COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies suggest that COPD exacerbations are associated with increased loss of lung function longitudinally,(particularly among those individuals with better baseline lung function levels)
## occupation exposure 
* exposure to dust and fumes
* Specific exposure 
	* coal mining, 
	* gold mining 
	* cotton textile dust
* coal mine dust exposure was a significant risk factor for emphysema in both smokers and nonsmokers
* less important than cigarette 
## Ambient air pollution
* urban compared to rural areas, more respiratory symptoms 
* relationship unproven 
* smoke produced by biomass combustion in cooking is seen in women 
## passive or second hand smoking 
* maternal smoking results in significantly reduced lung growth 
* In utero, tobacco smoke exposure also contributes to significant reductions in postnatal pulmonary function 
## Genetic 
* development of airflow obstruction in smokers is highly variable. 
* Severe α1AT deficiency is a proven risk factor 
* α1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (1% of COPD)
	* PI or SERPINA1 locus codes 
	* M allele is normal 
	* S is low level 
	* Z is marked reduction 
	* Null is absence 
	* PiZ is most common with 2 null and one Z 
	* develop early-onset COPD 
	* measurement of the immunologic level of α1AT in serum 
	* α1AT augmentation therapy is available for severe α1AT deficiency as a weekly IV infusion 
* Others 
	* Familial aggregation of airflow obstruction within families of COPD patients has also been demonstrated 
	* >80 regions of the genome contain COPD susceptibility loci
	* HHIP on chromosome 4

# Natural History 
* effect of smoking depends on 
	* intensity of smoking exposure, 
	* the timing of smoking exposure during growth and development 
	* baseline lung function of the individual
* Tracking of pulmonary function ++ 
* FEV1 relates to risk of mortality 
* ![[COPDtracking.png]]
* smoking cessation at an earlier age providing a more beneficial effect than smoking cessation after marked reductions in pulmonary function have already developed
* absolute annual loss in FEV1 tends to be highest in mild COPD and lowest in very severe COPD 
* In chronic smokers, CT changes maybe present without spirometry change 
	* emphysema-predominant pattern show emphysema early and classically progress through GOLD 1 to GOLD 2–4
	* airway disease–predominant pattern initial evidence of airway inflammation and progress with little emphysema early as FEV1 falls while retaining a ***normal FEV1/FVC ratio***
		* preserved ratio–impaired spirometry (***PRISm***) physiology
		* Late emphysema 
		* direct to GOLD 3/4 

# Clinical presentation 
## History 
* symptoms 
	* cough, 
	* sputum production 
	* exertional dyspnea
		* increased effort to breathe, heaviness, air hunger, or gasping
		* insidious onset 
		* seek history of physical activity and ability to perform 
		* arm work, at or above shoulde
* exists for years before seeking medical attention
* Progressive but patients date it to a infection in past while history will give evidence of prior respiratory symptoms

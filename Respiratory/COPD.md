* Disease state characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction
* includes 
	* ***Emphysema***
		* ***anatomically*** defined condition with destruction of the lung alveoli with air space enlargement; 
	* ***chronic bronchitis***, 
		* a ***clinically*** defined condition with chronic cough and phlegm; and/or 
	* ***small airway disease***, 
		* a condition in which small bronchioles are narrowed and reduced in number
* Classic definition 
	* requires the presence of chronic airflow obstruction, determined by spirometry
* All 3 forms present in varying degrees in different patients 
* May have either of 3 without airflow obstruction so cant be defined as COPD but similar process 
* ***COPDGene*** study recently proposed a multidimensional approach to COPD diagnosis, which is based on domains of 
	* environmental exposures, 
	* respiratory symptoms, 
	* imaging abnormalities, 
	* physiologic abnormalities.
# Pathogenesis 
* Airflow obstruction may be from airway disease or emphysema 
* Small airways may become narrowed by 
	* cells (hyperplasia and accumulation), 
	* mucus 
	* fibrosis,
* extensive small airway destruction has been demonstrated to be a ***hallmark*** of COPD.
* Pulmonary vascular destruction occurs in concert with small airway disease and emphysema 
* Pathogenesis paradigm consists of 4 interrelated events 
	* Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke in genetically susceptible individuals triggers inflammatory and immune cell recruitment within large and small airways and in the terminal air spaces of the lung.
	* Inflammatory cells release proteinases that damage the extracellular matrix supporting airways, vasculature, and gas exchange surfaces of the lungs 
	* Structural cell death occurs through oxidant-induced damage, cellular senescence, and proteolytic loss of cellular-matrix attachments leading to extensive loss of smaller airways, vascular pruning, and alveolar destruction 
	* Disordered repair of elastin and other extracellular matrix components contributes to air space enlargement and emphysema.
## Inflammation and extracellular matrix proteolysis 
* Elastin is principle component of elastic fibres and highly stable, crucial to integrity of lung 
* ***elastase:antielastase hypothesis***
	* the balance of elastin-degrading enzymes and their inhibitors determines the susceptibility of the lung to destruction, resulting in air space enlargement
	* Based on genetic deficiency in α1 antitrypsin (***α1AT***), the inhibitor of the serine proteinase neutrophil elastase, were at increased risk of emphysema, and that instillation of elastases, including neutrophil elastase, into experimental animals results in emphysema
* complex network of immune and inflammatory cells and additional biological mechanisms that contribute to emphysema have subsequently been identified

* Autoimmune mechanism may promote progression of disease

* Disease state characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction
* includes 
	* ***Emphysema***
		* ***anatomically*** defined condition with destruction of the lung alveoli with air space enlargement; 
	* ***chronic bronchitis***, 
		* a ***clinically*** defined condition with chronic cough and phlegm; and/or 
	* ***small airway disease***, 
		* a condition in which small bronchioles are narrowed and reduced in number
* Classic definition 
	* requires the presence of chronic airflow obstruction, determined by spirometry
* All 3 forms present in varying degrees in different patients 
* May have either of 3 without airflow obstruction so cant be defined as COPD but similar process 
* ***COPDGene*** study recently proposed a multidimensional approach to COPD diagnosis, which is based on domains of 
	* environmental exposures, 
	* respiratory symptoms, 
	* imaging abnormalities, 
	* physiologic abnormalities.
# Pathogenesis 
* Airflow obstruction may be from airway disease or emphysema

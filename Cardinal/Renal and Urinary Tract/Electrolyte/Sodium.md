- Water = 50% of men, 60% women 
	- ICF = 55-75% 
	- ECF = 25-45% 
		- Intravascular / Plasma => 1/4 
		- extravascular / Interstitial -> 3/4 
		- intravascular <-> extravascular water by capillary wall -->
			- Starling forces of hydraulic pressure and oncotic pressure 
			- transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient exceeds the corresponding oncotic pressure gradient, thereby favoring the movement of plasma ultrafiltrate into the extravascular space
- Osmolality = solute/ particle concentration in mOsm/kg 
	- ECF osmolality = ICF osmolality by **Water flow**
- ECF - Na, Cl, HCO3 
- ICF K, organic phosphate -> ATP, creatine phosphate , phospholipid 
- Ineffective Osmoles --> solute that do not contribute to water shift across membrane eg. urea 
# Water Balance 
- Vasopressin , water intake, renal water transport 
- body osmolality ~ 280-295 mOsm/kg 
## Vasopressin 
- magnocellular neuron of hypothalamus 
	- distal axons project to posterior pituitary or neurohypophysis --> release into circulation 
- half-life 10-20min --> rapid effect on water homeostasis 
- Osmoreceptors 
		- magnocellular neurons, central neurons 
		- via nonselective stretch-activated cation channels 
		- activated by increase , inhibited by decrease osmolality --> activated --> AVP release --> thirst 
- FACTORS affecting release 
	- AVP secretion, thirst and water ingestion at osmolality >285 --> linear relationship with release 
	- blood volume and BP changes also act as stimuli for AVP but weaker sensitivity 
- ECF modulates AVP release --> hypovolemia increase slope of response curve + lower threshold of release

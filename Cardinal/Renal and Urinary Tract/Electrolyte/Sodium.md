- Water = 50% of men, 60% women 
	- ICF = 55-75% 
	- ECF = 25-45% 
		- Intravascular / Plasma => 1/4 
		- extravascular / Interstitial -> 3/4 
		- intravascular <-> extravascular water by capillary wall -->
			- Starling forces of hydraulic pressure and oncotic pressure 
			- transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient exceeds the corresponding oncotic pressure gradient, thereby favoring the movement of plasma ultrafiltrate into the extravascular space
- Osmolality = solute/ particle concentration in mOsm/kg 
	- ECF osmolality = ICF osmolality by **Water flow**
- ECF - Na, Cl, HCO3 
- ICF K, organic phosphate -> ATP, creatine phosphate , phospholipid 
- Ineffective Osmoles --> solute that do not contribute to water shift across membrane eg. urea 
# Water Balance 
- Vasopressin , water intake, renal water transport 
- body osmolality ~ 280-295 mOsm/kg 
## Vasopressin 
- magnocellular neuron of hypothalamus 
	- distal axons project to posterior pituitary or neurohypophysis --> release into circulation 
- half-life 10-20min --> rapid effect on water homeostasis 
- Osmoreceptors 
		- magnocellular neurons, central neurons 
		- via nonselective stretch-activated cation channels 
		- activated by increase , inhibited by decrease osmolality --> activated --> AVP release --> thirst 
- FACTORS affecting release 
	- AVP secretion, thirst and water ingestion at osmolality >285 --> linear relationship with release 
	- blood volume and BP changes also act as stimuli for AVP but weaker sensitivity 
	- ECF modulates AVP release --> hypovolemia increase slope of response curve + lower threshold of release 
	- non-osmotic stimuli 
		- nausea 
		- intracerebral angiotensin 2
		- serotonin 
		- drugs 
- Effects 
	- electrolyte-free water retention / release by kidney 
	- V2 receptor in TAL of LOH, Principal cells of CD --> intracellular cAMP & protein kinase A increase --> Na-Cl-K transport in TALH affected 
	- AVP induced, PKA dependent phosphorylation of aquaporin-2 --> active water channel in lumen of CD --> water absorption down the medullary gradient --> concentrated urine 1200mosm/kg 
	- in absence of AVP --> insertion of aquaporin-2 channels and water absorption across the CD is essentially abolished --> secretion of a hypotonic, dilute urine (osmolality as low as 30â€“50 mOsm/kg) 
## Maintenance of Arterial Circulatory Integrity 
- Na actively pumped out of cells by Na+-K+ATPase pump 
- 85-90% Na is extracellular --> ECF volume function of total body Na content 
- arterial perfusion and circulatory integrity depend on SVR and renal retention / excretion of Na 
- Na filtered by glomeruli , reabsorbed by tubules alomg with Cl (2/3 by PCT --> paracellular & transcellular both, 25-30% by TALH --> apical furosemide-sensitive na+-K-2Cl, 5-10% by Na-Cl cotransporter in DCT)
- Fine-tuning of Na-Cl by DCT, connecting tubule, CD (amiloride-sensitive ENac )
- 99.6% of Na-Cl reabsorbed to excrete 100mM/day 
- Angiotensin II, adrenergic  --> more proximal Na-Cl reabsorption 
- Dopamine --> natriuretic 
- Aldosterone --> ENaC mediated Na-Cl distal absorption 

# Sodium Disorder 
- abnormalities of water homeostasis 
	- water intake and AVP release dependent 
- the absolute plasma Na+ concentration tells one nothing about the volume status of a given patient 
## Hyponatremia 
- Na < 135 
- almost always --> more AVP/ more sensitivity to AVP + free water intake 
### Hypovolemic 
- Hypovolemia --> increased AVP levels --> preserve BP by V1A baroreceptors and vasoreceptors + V2 receptor sodium reabsorption 
- Non-renal causes 
	- GI loss --> vomiting , diarrhea , tube drainage 
	- Insensible loss --> sweating, burns 
	- Urina Na <20mM 
		- if no hypervolemia --> likely rapid increase in Na once IV NS given as AVP levels fall --> water diuresis 
- Renal 
	- inappropriate Na-Cl loss in urine --> Na urinary >20 
	- primary adrenal insufficiency and other causes of hypoaldosteronism --> deficiency in circulating aldosterone and/or its renal effects

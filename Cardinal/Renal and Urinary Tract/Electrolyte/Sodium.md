- Water = 50% of men, 60% women 
	- ICF = 55-75% 
	- ECF = 25-45% 
		- Intravascular / Plasma => 1/4 
		- extravascular / Interstitial -> 3/4 
		- intravascular <-> extravascular water by capillary wall -->
			- Starling forces of hydraulic pressure and oncotic pressure 
			- transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient exceeds the corresponding oncotic pressure gradient, thereby favoring the movement of plasma ultrafiltrate into the extravascular space
- Osmolality = solute/ particle concentration in mOsm/kg 
	- ECF osmolality = ICF osmolality by **Water flow**
- ECF - Na, Cl, HCO3 
- ICF K, organic phosphate -> ATP, creatine phosphate , phospholipid 
- Ineffective Osmoles --> solute that do not contribute to water shift across membrane eg. urea 
# Water Balance 
- Vasopressin , water intake, renal water transport 
- body osmolality ~ 280-295 mOsm/kg 
## Vasopressin 
- magnocellular neuron of hypothalamus 
	- distal axons project to posterior pituitary or neurohypophysis --> release into circulation 
- half-life 10-20min --> rapid effect on water homeostasis 
- Osmoreceptors 
		- magnocellular neurons, central neurons 
		- via nonselective stretch-activated cation channels 
		- activated by increase , inhibited by decrease osmolality --> activated --> AVP release --> thirst 
- FACTORS affecting release 
	- AVP secretion, thirst and water ingestion at osmolality >285 --> linear relationship with release 
	- blood volume and BP changes also act as stimuli for AVP but weaker sensitivity 
	- ECF modulates AVP release --> hypovolemia increase slope of response curve + lower threshold of release 
	- non-osmotic stimuli 
		- nausea 
		- intracerebral angiotensin 2
		- serotonin 
		- drugs 
- Effects 
	- electrolyte-free water retention / release by kidney 
	- V2 receptor in TAL of LOH, Principal cells of CD --> intracellular cAMP & protein kinase A increase --> Na-Cl-K transport in TALH affected 
	- AVP induced, PKA dependent phosphorylation of aquaporin-2 --> active water channel in lumen of CD --> water absorption down the medullary gradient --> concentrated urine 1200mosm/kg 
	- in absence of AVP --> insertion of aquaporin-2 channels and water absorption across the CD is essentially abolished --> secretion of a hypotonic, dilute urine (osmolality as low as 30–50 mOsm/kg) 
## Maintenance of Arterial Circulatory Integrity 
- Na actively pumped out of cells by Na+-K+ATPase pump 
- 85-90% Na is extracellular --> ECF volume function of total body Na content 
- arterial perfusion and circulatory integrity depend on SVR and renal retention / excretion of Na 
- Na filtered by glomeruli , reabsorbed by tubules alomg with Cl (2/3 by PCT --> paracellular & transcellular both, 25-30% by TALH --> apical furosemide-sensitive na+-K-2Cl, 5-10% by Na-Cl cotransporter in DCT)
- Fine-tuning of Na-Cl by DCT, connecting tubule, CD (amiloride-sensitive ENac )
- 99.6% of Na-Cl reabsorbed to excrete 100mM/day 
- Angiotensin II, adrenergic  --> more proximal Na-Cl reabsorption 
- Dopamine --> natriuretic 
- Aldosterone --> ENaC mediated Na-Cl distal absorption 

# Sodium Disorder 
- abnormalities of water homeostasis 
	- water intake and AVP release dependent 
- the absolute plasma Na+ concentration tells one nothing about the volume status of a given patient 
## Hyponatremia 
- Na < 135 
- almost always --> more AVP/ more sensitivity to AVP + free water intake 
### Hypovolemic 
- Hypovolemia --> increased AVP levels --> preserve BP by V1A baroreceptors and vasoreceptors + V2 receptor sodium reabsorption 
- hyperuricemic due to a shared activation of proximal tubular Na+-Cl− and urate transport.
- Non-renal causes 
	- GI loss --> vomiting , diarrhea , tube drainage 
	- Insensible loss --> sweating, burns 
	- Urina Na <20mM 
		- if no hypervolemia --> likely rapid increase in Na once IV NS given as AVP levels fall --> water diuresis 
- Renal 
	- inappropriate Na-Cl loss in urine --> Na urinary >20 
	- primary adrenal insufficiency and other causes of hypoaldosteronism --> deficiency in circulating aldosterone and/or its renal effects --> as hyponatremia , hyperkalemia with hypotension /hypovolemia 
	- Salt-losing nephropathy --> reflux nephropathy , interstitial nephropathy , postobstructive nephropathy , medullary cystic disease , recovering ATN 
	- Thiazide --> polydipsia , volume depletion, but effect of AVP on kidney preserved 
	- Loop diuretc --> decreased Na+-K-2Cl at TALH --> reduced ability to concentrate urine
	- Increased excretion of osmotically active nonreabsorbable or poorly reabsorbed solute --> **glycosuria**, **ketonuria** (e.g., in starvation or in diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis), and **bicarbonaturia** (e.g., in renal tubular acidosis or metabolic alkalosis, where the associated bicarbonaturia leads to loss of Na+) 
	- Cerebral Salt wasting --> inappropriate natriuresis with intracranial disease --> SAH, Traumatic brain injury , craniotome, encephalitis , meningitis --> respond to Na-Cl repletion --> so differentiate with SIADH 
### Hypervolemic 
- more Na-Cl  --> even more water
- AKI/CKD --> high urinary Na 
- sodium-avid edematous disorders (congestive heart failure -->CHF, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome) is similar to that in hypovolemic hyponatremia, except that arterial filling and circulatory integrity is decreased due to the specific etiologic factors (e.g., cardiac dysfunction in CHF, peripheral vasodilation in cirrhosis) 
	- urinary sodium <10
- degree of hyponatremia is prognostic 
### Euvolemic 
- moderate to severe hypothyroidism (corrects once thyroid normal )
- secondary adrenal insufficiency (glucocorticoid deficiency ) --> negative feedback on AVP release by the posterior pituitary such that hydrocortisone replacement in these patients can rapidly normalize the AVP response to osmolality, reducing circulating AVP 
- SIADH 
	- intake of free water, with persistent intake at serum osmolalities that are lower than the usual threshold for thirst;
	- osmotic threshold and osmotic response curves for the sensation of thirst are shifted downward 
	- may have 
		- unregulated erratic AVP in 1/3 
		- failure to suppress AVP at lower osmolalities but normal at hyperosmolar 
		- Reset osmostat--> lower threshold osmolality and left-shift osmotic response curve 
		- no circulating AVP --> gain in function in renal water reabsorption or a circulating antidiuretic substance that is distinct from AVP (gain in function is in V2 AVP receptor --> nephrogenic SIAD) 
	- ![[siadhcauses.png]]
	- subclinical volume expanded 
	- AVP escape --> limit DCT transport --> maintain hypervolemic steady state 
	- uric acid --> low (reduced PCT due to increased DCT na-cl and water resorption ) 
	- Causes 
		- Tb, pneumonia , Pleural effusion 
		- CNS --> tumour , SAH, meningitis 
		- Malignancy 
			- m/c small cell lung ca (75% of malignancy associated )
		- Drugs --> SSRIs 
### Low Solute intake 
- alcoholic with sole intake beer --> beer potomania 
- extreme vegetation diets 
- very low urine osmolality (<100–200 mOsm/kg) with a urine Na+ concentration that is <10–20 mM 
- AVP levels have not been reported in patients with beer potomania but are expected to be suppressed or rapidly suppressible with saline hydration
- overly rapid correction in plasma Na+ concentration that can be seen with saline hydration 

### Clinical 
- generalized cellular swelling, a consequence of water movement down the osmotic gradient from the hypotonic ECF to the ICF 
- Neurological primary 
	- cerebral edema 
	- rise in interstitial pressure --> shunting of ECF & solute from interstitial --> CSF --> systemic circulation 
	- Acute Hyponatremic Encephalopathy (efflux of Na, K, Cl from brain cells )
	- Nausea , headache , vomiting 
	- complication --> seizure , herniation, coma, death 
	- normocapneic or hypercapneic respiratory failure 
		- normocapneic due to noncardiogenic, “neurogenic” pulmonary edema, with a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 
	- Women > men have encephalopathy and neurological sequela 
	- persistent , chronic --> efflux of organic osmolytes (creatine, betaine, glutamate, myoinositol, and taurine) from brain cells --> reduced intracellular osmolality and increased water entry **(completed in 48hours --> chronic)** 
	- asymptomatic may have subtle gait and cognitive defects --> increase fall risk 
	- chronic --> assymetric response 
		- reaccumulation of organic osmolytes by brain cells is attenuated and delayed as osmolality increases after correction of hyponatremia, sometimes resulting in ***degenerative loss of oligodendrocytes and an osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)*** 
	- Over rapid correction (>8-10mm/24 hour or >18mM in 48H) --> ODS
		- hypertonic stress in astrocyte --> generalised protein ubiquitination --> apoptotic and autophagic cell death 
		- BBB integrity disrupted --> immune mediated demyelination 
		- Pons 
			- central pontine myelinosis 
			- 1 or more days after over correction 
			- quadriparesis , dysphagia , dysarthria , diplopia, locked-in state +/- altered consciousness 
		- order of frequency, the lesions of extrapontine myelinolysis can occur in the cerebellum, lateral geniculate body, thalamus, putamen, and cerebral cortex or subcortex 
		- extent and localization of extrapontine myelinolysis, with the reported development of ataxia, mutism, parkinsonism, dystonia, and catatonia 
		- relowering Na after rapid correction can prevent or attentuate ODS 
		- slow correction + ODS --> alcoholic , malnutrition , hypokalemia, liver transplant 
### Diagnostic Evaluation 
- Drug history + volume status in all 
- Imaging for pulmonary /CNS causes 
- Xray maybe insufficient , consider HRCT in high risk like smoker 
- Osmolality to rule out pseudohyponatremia 
	- coexistence of hyponatremia with a normal or increased plasma tonicity
	- in hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinemia 
	- measured osmolality --> effective osmolality (tonicity) by subtracting the measured concentration of urea (divided by 2.8, if in mg/dL); 
	- hyponatremia have an effective osmolality of <275 mOsm/kg
- BUN / creatinine elevated --> renal dysfunction 
- hyperkalemia --> adrenal insufficiency , hypoaldosteronism 
- 1.6-2.4 mM fall in Na for every 100mg/dl increase in plasma glucose 
- uric acid --> SIADH - hypouricemia, volume-depletion --> hyperuricemic 
- hyroid, adrenal, and pituitary function should also be tested 
- rest from Harrison 
### TREATMENT 
- Acute more severe than chronic 
- if >8-10mM/24 hour correction --> risk of ODS 
- highly unpredictable response to therapy so regular monitoring of Na 
- euvolemic hyponatremia due to SIAD, hypothyroidism, or secondary adrenal failure will respond to successful treatment of

the underlying cause

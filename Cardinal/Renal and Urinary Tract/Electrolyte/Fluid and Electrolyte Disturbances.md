# Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances

## SODIUM AND WATER

### COMPOSITION OF BODY FLUIDS

- **Water**
    - Most abundant constituent in the body.
    - Comprises **~50% of body weight in women** and **60% in men**.
    - Total-body water distributed in two major compartments:
        - **Intracellular fluid (ICF)**: 55–75%.
        - **Extracellular fluid (ECF)**: 25–45%.
    - ECF further subdivided into intravascular (plasma water) and extravascular (interstitial) spaces in a **ratio of 1:3**.
    - Fluid movement between intravascular and interstitial spaces occurs across the capillary wall, determined by Starling forces (capillary hydraulic pressure and colloid osmotic pressure).
    - Transcapillary hydraulic pressure gradient favors movement of plasma ultrafiltrate into extravascular space.
    - Return of fluid into intravascular compartment occurs via lymphatic flow.
- **Osmolality**
    - Solute or particle concentration of a fluid, expressed as **milliosmoles per kilogram of water (mOsm/kg)**.
    - Water easily diffuses across most cell membranes to achieve osmotic equilibrium (ECF osmolality = ICF osmolality).
    - ECF and ICF solute compositions differ due to transporters, channels, and ATP-driven membrane pumps.
    - Major ECF particles: **Na+ and its accompanying anions Cl− and HCO3 −**.
    - Predominant ICF osmoles: **K+ and organic phosphate esters (ATP, creatine phosphate, and phospholipids)**.
    - "Tonicity" or effective osmolality: determined by solutes restricted to ECF or ICF.
    - Ineffective osmoles: solutes (particularly **urea**) that do not contribute to water shifts across most membranes.

### Water Balance

- Human body fluid osmolality maintained between **280 and 295 mOsm/kg** by vasopressin secretion, water ingestion, and renal water transport.
- **Vasopressin (AVP)**
    - Synthesized in magnocellular neurons within the hypothalamus; released from the posterior pituitary into circulation.
    - Central "osmoreceptor" neurons sense circulating osmolality via nonselective, stretch-activated cation channels.
    - Activated by modest increases in osmolality, leading to AVP release and thirst.
    - Inhibited by modest decreases in osmolality.
    - **Secretion stimulated as systemic osmolality increases above ~285 mOsm/kg**, showing a linear relationship between osmolality and circulating AVP.
    - **Thirst and water ingestion also activated at ~285 mOsm/kg**, with a linear increase in perceived intensity.
    - Changes in blood volume and blood pressure are direct stimuli, but less sensitive.
    - ECF volume strongly modulates the relationship between osmolality and AVP release:
        - **Hypovolemia reduces the osmotic threshold and increases the slope** of the response curve.
        - Hypervolemia has the opposite effect.
    - AVP has a **half-life of 10–20 min**, allowing rapid effects on water homeostasis.
    - Nonosmotic stimuli activating AVP release: nausea, intracerebral angiotensin II, serotonin, and multiple drugs.
- **Renal Water Transport**
    - Excretion or retention of electrolyte-free water by the kidney is modulated by circulating AVP.
    - AVP acts on renal, V2-type receptors in the thick ascending limb of Henle (TALH) and principal cells of the collecting duct (CD).
    - Increases intracellular cyclic AMP and activates protein kinase A (PKA)–dependent phosphorylation of transport proteins.
    - AVP- and PKA-dependent activation of Na+-Cl− and K+ transport by TALH is key to the countercurrent mechanism.
    - **Countercurrent mechanism increases interstitial osmolality in the inner medulla, driving water absorption across the renal CD**.
    - Water, salt, and solute transport by both proximal and distal nephron segments participate in the renal concentrating mechanism.
    - Water transport across aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) channels in the descending thin limb is involved.
    - Passive absorption of Na+-Cl− by the thin ascending limb occurs via CLC-K1 chloride channels and paracellular Na+ transport.
    - Renal urea transport plays important roles in generating the medullary osmotic gradient and excreting solute-free water.
    - **AVP-induced, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) in principal cells stimulates insertion of active water channels into the CD lumen**, leading to transepithelial water absorption down the medullary osmotic gradient.
    - Under "antidiuretic" conditions (increased circulating AVP), the kidney reabsorbs filtered water, equilibrating osmolality across the CD epithelium to excrete **hypertonic, "concentrated" urine (up to 1200 mOsm/kg)**.
    - In the absence of circulating AVP, AQP-2 insertion and water absorption are abolished, resulting in **hypotonic, dilute urine (as low as 30–50 mOsm/kg)**.
    - Abnormalities in this "final common pathway" are involved in most disorders of water homeostasis (e.g., reduced/absent AQP-2 insertion in diabetes insipidus [DI]).

### Maintenance of Arterial Circulatory Integrity

- Sodium (Na+) is actively pumped out of cells by the Na+/K+-ATPase membrane pump.
- **85–90% of body Na+ is extracellular**.
- The ECF volume (ECFV) is a function of total-body Na+ content.
- Arterial perfusion and circulatory integrity are determined by renal Na+ retention or excretion, and modulation of systemic arterial resistance.
- **Kidney filters ~25,200 mmol/d of Na+** (~1.5 kg of salt); **99.6% of filtered Na+-Cl− must be reabsorbed** to excrete 100 mM per day.
- Minute changes in renal Na+-Cl− excretion significantly affect ECFV, leading to edema or hypovolemia.
- **Renal Na+-Cl− Reabsorption**
    - **Approximately two-thirds is reabsorbed by the renal proximal tubule**.
    - Another 25–30% is reabsorbed by the TALH via the apical, furosemide-sensitive Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter.
    - The aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (distal convoluted tubule [DCT], connecting tubule [CNT], and CD) performs "fine-tuning".
        - The thiazide-sensitive apical Na+-Cl− cotransporter (NCC) reabsorbs 5–10% in the DCT.
        - Principal cells in the CNT and CD reabsorb Na+ via electrogenic, amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC).
        - Cl− ions are primarily reabsorbed by adjacent intercalated cells via apical Cl− exchange.
    - Regulated by multiple circulating and paracrine hormones, and renal nerves.
    - Angiotensin II and adrenergic receptors activate proximal Na+-Cl− reabsorption.
    - Locally generated dopamine has a natriuretic effect.
    - **Aldosterone primarily activates Na+-Cl− reabsorption within the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron**, activating the ENaC channel in principal cells, inducing Na+ absorption and promoting K+ excretion.
- **Circulatory Integrity Response**
    - "Underfilling" of the arterial circulation is sensed by ventricular and vascular pressure receptors.
    - Results in neurohumoral activation (increased sympathetic tone, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis activation, increased circulating AVP).
    - Synergistically increases renal Na+-Cl− reabsorption, vascular resistance, and renal water reabsorption.
    - Occurs in decreased cardiac output (e.g., hypovolemic states, low-output cardiac failure) or excessive arterial vasodilation.
    - **AVP functions in the defense of circulatory integrity**, inducing vasoconstriction, increasing sympathetic nervous system tone, increasing renal retention of both water and Na+-Cl−, and modulating the arterial baroreceptor reflex.
    - Systemic V1A AVP receptors are involved in most of these responses.
    - Concomitant activation of V2 receptors in the kidney can lead to renal water retention and hyponatremia.

## HYPOVOLEMIA

### Etiology

- **True volume depletion (hypovolemia)** generally refers to a state of **combined salt and water loss**, leading to contraction of the ECFV.
- Loss can be renal or nonrenal.
- **Renal Causes** (Excessive urinary Na+-Cl− and water loss):
    - Osmotic diuresis: High filtered load of endogenous solutes (glucose, urea) or exogenous mannitol impairs tubular reabsorption.
    - Pharmacologic diuretics: Selectively impair Na+-Cl− reabsorption.
    - Other drugs: Acetazolamide (inhibits carbonic anhydrase), trimethoprim (TMP), pentamidine (inhibit ENaC).
    - Hereditary defects in renal transport proteins.
    - Mineralocorticoid deficiency, resistance, or inhibition of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MLR).
    - Tubulointerstitial injury (interstitial nephritis, acute tubular injury, obstructive uropathy).
    - **Excessive excretion of free water (water without electrolytes)**: Occurs in decreased circulating AVP or renal resistance to AVP (central and nephrogenic DI). Effect on ECFV is usually less marked, as two-thirds of the water is lost from the ICF.
- **Extrarenal Causes**:
    - Fluid loss from the gastrointestinal tract: Impaired reabsorption or enhanced secretion (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea). Vomiting often causes metabolic alkalosis; diarrhea often causes metabolic acidosis.
    - Evaporation of water from skin and respiratory tract (**"insensible losses"**): Typically 500–650 mL/d; increases with fever, heat exposure, hyperventilation, exertion, ambient temperature. Sweat is hypotonic to plasma.
        - Profuse sweating without adequate repletion can lead to hypovolemia and hypertonicity.
        - Replacement with surfeit of free water without adequate electrolytes can lead to hypovolemic hyponatremia.
    - Excessive fluid accumulation in interstitial and/or peritoneal spaces (**"third spacing"**): Increases in vascular permeability and/or reduced oncotic pressure alter Starling forces.
        - Occurs in sepsis syndrome, burns, pancreatitis, nutritional hypoalbuminemia, peritonitis.
    - Distributive hypovolemia: Fluid accumulation within specific compartments (e.g., bowel lumen in GI obstruction).
    - Hemorrhage: Extracorporeal or into an expandable space (e.g., retroperitoneum).

### Diagnostic Evaluation

- History usually determines etiologic cause.
- Symptoms (nonspecific): fatigue, weakness, thirst, postural dizziness. Severe symptoms: oliguria, cyanosis, abdominal/chest pain, confusion/obtundation.
- Physical examination:
    - Diminished skin turgor and dry oral mucous membranes are less ideal markers in adults.
    - **More reliable signs**: **decreased jugular venous pressure (JVP), orthostatic tachycardia (>15–20 beats/min increase), and orthostatic hypotension (>10–20 mmHg drop)**.
    - Severe fluid loss (hypovolemic shock): hypotension, tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, hypoperfusion, cyanosis, cold extremities, oliguria, altered mental status.
- Routine chemistries:
    - Increased BUN and creatinine, reflecting decreased GFR. Creatinine is more dependable for GFR.
    - May reveal acid-base disorders (e.g., metabolic acidosis from diarrhea, lactic acidosis in shock).
- Neurohumoral response to hypovolemia stimulates increased renal tubular Na+ and water reabsorption.
    - **Urine Na+ concentration typically <20 mM in nonrenal causes of hypovolemia**, with a **urine osmolality of >450 mOsm/kg**.
    - Reduced GFR and distal tubular Na+ delivery may cause a defect in renal K+ excretion, increasing plasma K+.
    - Patients with hypovolemia and hypochloremic alkalosis (vomiting, diarrhea, diuretics) will typically have **urine Na+ >20 mM and urine pH >7.0**. The **urine Cl− concentration (<25 mM) is a more accurate indicator of volume status** in this setting.
    - Urine Na+ concentration is often **>20 mM in renal causes** of hypovolemia (e.g., acute tubular necrosis).
    - Patients with DI will have inappropriately dilute urine.

### Treatment

- Therapeutic goals: **restore normovolemia and replace ongoing fluid losses**.
- Mild hypovolemia: Oral hydration and normal diet.
- Severe hypovolemia: Intravenous hydration, choice of solution tailored to pathophysiology.
    - **Isotonic, "normal" saline (0.9% NaCl)**: Most appropriate for normonatremic or hyponatremic patients with severe hypovolemia. Colloid solutions are not demonstrably superior.
    - Hypernatremic patients: Receive a hypotonic solution.
        - If water loss only (DI): 5% dextrose.
        - If water and Na+-Cl− loss: Hypotonic saline (1/2 or 1/4 normal saline).
        - Frequent monitoring of serum chemistries.
    - Patients with bicarbonate loss and metabolic acidosis (e.g., diarrhea): Receive intravenous bicarbonate (isotonic or hypotonic solutions).
    - Severe hemorrhage or anemia: Red cell transfusions, hematocrit not beyond 35%.

## SODIUM DISORDERS

- Disorders of serum Na+ concentration are caused by abnormalities in **water homeostasis**, leading to changes in the relative ratio of Na+ to body water.
- **Water intake and circulating AVP are the two key effectors in the defense of serum osmolality**.
- Abnormalities in sodium homeostasis per se lead to a deficit or surplus of whole-body Na+-Cl− content, which determines ECFV and circulatory integrity.
- Hypovolemia is associated with higher circulating levels of AVP at each level of serum osmolality.
- In "hypervolemic" causes of arterial underfilling (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis), increased AVP leads to water retention and hyponatremia.
- **Key concept**: The absolute plasma Na+ concentration tells nothing about the volume status of a given patient, which must be considered in diagnosis and therapy.

### HYPONATREMIA

- Defined as a **plasma Na+ concentration <135 mM**.
- Very common (up to 22% of hospitalized patients).
- Almost always results from **increased circulating AVP and/or increased renal sensitivity to AVP, combined with free water intake**. (Exception: low solute intake).
- Subdivided diagnostically into "hypovolemic," "euvolemic," and "hypervolemic" based on clinical history and volume status.
- **Hypovolemic Hyponatremia**
    - Hypovolemia causes marked neurohumoral activation, increasing circulating AVP levels.
    - Increased AVP helps preserve blood pressure and increases water reabsorption via renal V2 receptors, which can lead to hyponatremia with increased free water intake.
    - Nonrenal causes: Gastrointestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea) and insensible loss (sweating, burns) of Na+-Cl− and water, without adequate oral replacement.
        - **Urine Na+ concentration is typically <20 mM**.
        - Patients may be clinically euvolemic, but reduced urinary Na+ concentration indicates the cause.
        - Urine Na+ <20 mM (without hypervolemic cause) predicts rapid plasma Na+ increase with IV normal saline (saline induces a water diuresis as AVP plummets).
    - Renal causes: Inappropriate loss of Na+-Cl− in the urine, leading to volume depletion and increased AVP.
        - **Urine Na+ concentration is typically >20 mM**.
        - Deficiency in circulating aldosterone or its renal effects (e.g., primary adrenal insufficiency).
        - Salt-losing nephropathies (e.g., reflux nephropathy, interstitial nephropathies, postobstructive uropathy, medullary cystic disease, recovery phase of acute tubular necrosis).
        - Thiazide diuretics: Cause hyponatremia via polydipsia and diuretic-induced volume depletion; they do not inhibit the renal concentrating mechanism.
        - Loop diuretics: Less frequently associated with hyponatremia; inhibit Na+-Cl− and K+ absorption, blunting the countercurrent mechanism.
        - Increased excretion of an osmotically active nonreabsorbable or poorly reabsorbable solute (e.g., glycosuria, ketonuria, bicarbonaturia).
        - **"Cerebral salt wasting"**: Rare, with clinical hypovolemia and inappropriate natriuresis in association with intracranial disease (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, meningitis). Critical to distinguish from SIAD, as it responds to aggressive Na+-Cl− repletion.
- **Hypervolemic Hyponatremia**
    - Patients develop an increase in total-body Na+-Cl− accompanied by a proportionately greater increase in total-body water, leading to a reduced plasma Na+ concentration.
    - Acute or chronic renal failure is uniquely associated with an **increase in urine Na+ concentration**.
    - In sodium-avid edematous disorders (congestive heart failure [CHF], cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome), arterial filling/circulatory integrity is decreased due to specific etiologic factors.
    - **Urine Na+ concentration is typically very low (<10 mM)**, even after hydration with normal saline.
    - The degree of hyponatremia indicates associated neurohumoral activation and is a prognostic indicator.
- **Euvolemic Hyponatremia**
    - Can occur in **moderate to severe hypothyroidism**.
    - **Secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary disease**: Predominant glucocorticoid deficiency; glucocorticoids exert negative feedback on AVP release.
    - **Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis (SIAD)**: Most frequent cause.
        - Requires free water intake, with persistent intake at serum osmolalities lower than the usual thirst threshold.
        - Four distinct patterns of AVP secretion recognized:
            - Unregulated, erratic AVP secretion.
            - Failure to suppress AVP secretion at lower serum osmolalities.
            - "Reset osmostat" with a lower threshold osmolality.
            - No detectable circulating AVP (suggests gain in function in renal water reabsorption or distinct antidiuretic substance, e.g., gain-in-function mutations of V2 AVP receptor).
        - Patients with SIAD are subclinically volume-expanded due to AVP-induced water and Na+-Cl− retention. "AVP escape" mechanisms limit distal renal tubular transport.
        - **Serum uric acid is often low (<4 mg/dL)** in SIAD, consistent with suppressed proximal tubular transport. (Hypovolemic hyponatremia often hyperuricemic).
        - **Common causes**: pulmonary disease (pneumonia, tuberculosis), central nervous system (CNS) diseases (tumor, subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis).
        - Malignancies: Most commonly **small-cell lung carcinoma** (75% of malignancy-associated SIAD).
        - Drugs: Frequent complication of **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**; other drugs can potentiate renal effect of AVP.
- **Low Solute Intake and Hyponatremia**
    - Occurs in patients with very low dietary solute intake, classically **beer potomania** (alcoholics whose sole nutrient is beer, low in protein and salt).
    - Also described in nonalcoholic patients with highly restricted diets (e.g., extreme vegetarian diets).
    - Patients typically present with **very low urine osmolality (<100–200 mOsm/kg)** and a **urine Na+ concentration <10–20 mM**.
    - Fundamental abnormality: inadequate dietary intake of solutes, limiting water excretion.
    - AVP levels are expected to be suppressed or rapidly suppressible.
    - Resumption of a normal diet and/or saline hydration will promptly correct plasma Na+ concentration.
    - **Patients with beer potomania have a very high risk of developing Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS)** due to associated hypokalemia, alcoholism, malnutrition, and high risk of overcorrection.

### Clinical Features of Hyponatremia

- Induces generalized cellular swelling due to water movement from hypotonic ECF to ICF.
- Symptoms are primarily neurologic, reflecting cerebral edema within a rigid skull.
- Acute hyponatremia: Initial CNS response involves shunting ECF and solutes from interstitial space into CSF, and efflux of intracellular ions (Na+, K+, Cl−) from brain cells.
    - Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy occurs when these mechanisms are overwhelmed, leading to acute cerebral edema.
    - Early symptoms: nausea, headache, vomiting.
    - Severe complications: **seizure activity, brainstem herniation, coma, and death**.
    - Key complication: **normocapneic or hypercapneic respiratory failure**; associated hypoxia may amplify neurologic injury.
    - **Acute symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency**.
    - **Women, particularly before menopause, are more likely to develop encephalopathy** and severe neurologic sequelae.
    - Often iatrogenic (e.g., hypotonic IV fluids post-op with increased AVP) or associated with exercise (e.g., marathons).
    - Recreational drugs (Molly, Ecstasy/MDMA) cause rapid induction of thirst and AVP, leading to severe acute hyponatremia.
- Chronic hyponatremia (persistent >48 h):
    - Results in efflux of organic osmolytes (creatine, betaine, glutamate, myoinositol, taurine) from brain cells, reducing intracellular osmolality.
    - This reduction is largely complete within 48 h (clinical definition of chronic hyponatremia).
    - Symptoms: vomiting, nausea, confusion, seizures (usually at plasma Na+ <125 mM).
    - Even "asymptomatic" patients can manifest **subtle gait and cognitive defects** that reverse with correction.
    - **Increases the risk of falls and bony fractures**.
    - Safe correction of plasma Na+ is attempted even in the absence of overt symptoms.
- **Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS)**
    - **A key complication of overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia**.
    - Reaccumulation of organic osmolytes by brain cells is attenuated and delayed as osmolality increases.
    - **Overly rapid correction (>8–10 mM in 24 h or >18 mM in 48 h)** causes hypertonic stress in astrocytes, leading to protein ubiquitination, endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptotic and autophagic cell death.
    - Also causes disruption of blood-brain barrier integrity, allowing entry of immune mediators.
    - Lesions classically affect the **pons (central pontine myelinolysis)**.
    - Clinical presentation (1 or more days after overcorrection): paraparesis/quadriparesis, dysphagia, dysarthria, diplopia, "locked-in syndrome," loss of consciousness.
    - Extrapontine myelinolysis can occur (cerebellum, lateral geniculate body, thalamus, putamen, cerebral cortex/subcortex), causing ataxia, mutism, parkinsonism, dystonia, catatonia.
    - **Relowering of plasma Na+ concentration after overly rapid correction can prevent or attenuate ODS**.
    - Even appropriately slow correction can be associated with ODS, especially with risk factors: alcoholism, malnutrition, hypokalemia, and liver transplantation.

### Diagnostic Evaluation of Hyponatremia

- Clinical assessment focuses on the underlying cause; **a detailed drug history is crucial**.
- **A careful clinical assessment of volume status is obligatory** for the classical diagnostic approach.
- Hyponatremia is frequently multifactorial; consider volume status, drugs, nausea, pain.
- Radiologic imaging may be appropriate for pulmonary or CNS causes (e.g., CT scan for small-cell lung carcinoma risk).
- **Laboratory investigation**:
    - **Serum osmolality**: Essential to exclude **pseudohyponatremia** (hyponatremia with normal or increased plasma tonicity).
        - Pseudohyponatremia due to extreme hyperlipidemia and/or hyperproteinemia.
        - Measured osmolality should be converted to effective osmolality (tonicity) by subtracting urea concentration; hyponatremic patients have an effective osmolality of **<275 mOsm/kg**.
    - Elevated BUN and creatinine: Indicate renal dysfunction.
    - Hyperkalemia: May suggest adrenal insufficiency or hypoaldosteronism.
    - **Serum glucose**: Plasma Na+ falls by ~1.6–2.4 mM for every 100-mg/dL increase in glucose (glucose-induced water efflux); "true" hyponatremia resolves after hyperglycemia correction.
    - **Serum uric acid**: SIAD-type physiology typically hypouricemic (<4 mg/dL); volume-depleted patients often hyperuricemic.
    - Thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary function tests in appropriate clinical settings.
        - Hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal failure are causes of euvolemic hyponatremia.
        - Primary adrenal failure causes hypovolemic hyponatremia.
        - Cosyntropin stimulation test for primary adrenal insufficiency.
    - **Urine electrolytes and osmolality are crucial tests**.
        - **Urine Na+ concentration <20–30 mM** is consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia (in absence of hypervolemic, Na+-avid syndrome like CHF).
        - **SIAD patients typically excrete urine with an Na+ concentration >30 mM**.
        - **"Gold standard" for hypovolemic hyponatremia**: Demonstration that plasma Na+ concentration corrects after hydration with normal saline.
        - Thiazide-associated hyponatremia may present with higher urine Na+; defer SIAD diagnosis until 1–2 weeks after discontinuing thiazide.
        - **Urine osmolality <100 mOsm/kg is suggestive of polydipsia**.
        - **Urine osmolality >400 mOsm/kg indicates dominant AVP excess**.
        - Intermediate values are more consistent with multifactorial pathophysiology.
        - Hyponatremia due to decreased solute intake (beer potomania) typically has urine Na+ <20 mM and urine osmolality <100 to low 200s.
        - Urine K+ concentration is required to calculate the urine-to-plasma electrolyte ratio, useful for predicting response to fluid restriction.

### Treatment of Hyponatremia

- Three major considerations guide therapy:
    1. **Presence/severity of symptoms** determines urgency and goals.
        - Acute hyponatremia symptoms range from headache to seizures and central herniation.
        - Chronic hyponatremia (>48 h) patients are less likely to have severe symptoms.
    2. **Chronic hyponatremia patients are at risk for ODS if plasma Na+ concentration is corrected by >8–10 mM within the first 24 h and/or by >18 mM within the first 48 h**.
    3. Response to interventions can be highly unpredictable; **frequent monitoring of plasma Na+ concentration is imperative**.
- **Treatment of underlying cause** is key.
    - Euvolemic hyponatremia (SIAD, hypothyroidism, secondary adrenal failure) responds to successful treatment of the cause. Pharmacologic therapy may be needed if the cause is not immediately reversible.
    - Hypovolemic hyponatremia responds to IV isotonic normal saline, causing rapid AVP reduction and water diuresis.
    - Hypervolemic hyponatremia (CHF) often responds to improved cardiomyopathy therapy.
    - Hyponatremia due to beer potomania and low solute intake responds rapidly to IV saline and normal diet. **High ODS risk in beer potomania patients**.
- **Water deprivation** has been a cornerstone of chronic hyponatremia therapy, but can be difficult for SIAD patients due to thirst.
    - **Urine-to-plasma electrolyte ratio (urinary [Na+] + [K+]/plasma [Na+])** indicates electrolyte-free water excretion:
        - Ratio >1: Aggressive restriction (<500 mL/d).
        - Ratio ~1: Restriction to 500–700 mL/d.
        - Ratio <1: Restriction to <1 L/d.
- **Potassium replacement** in hypokalemic patients will serve to increase plasma Na+ concentration. Aggressive K+ repletion has the potential to overcorrect plasma Na+.
- Increased dietary solute intake (oral salt tablets, oral urea) increases free water excretion, helping increase plasma Na+.
- **Pharmacologic therapy** (if other measures fail):
    - SIAD: Oral furosemide + oral salt tablets (furosemide inhibits renal countercurrent mechanism, salt counteracts natriuresis). Risks include hypokalemia and renal dysfunction.
    - Demeclocycline: Potent inhibitor of principal cells, but can reduce GFR and is risky in cirrhosis.
    - Palatable oral urea preparations: Comparable efficacy to AVP antagonists for SIAD.
    - **AVP antagonists (vaptans)**: Highly effective in SIAD and hypervolemic hyponatremia (heart failure, cirrhosis) by augmenting free water clearance.
        - Most antagonize V2 AVP receptor; tolvaptan is the only oral V2 antagonist approved. Conivaptan is an IV mixed V1A/V2 antagonist.
        - Initiate in hospital with liberalized fluid restriction and close plasma Na+ monitoring.
        - **Tolvaptan is appropriate for significant, persistent SIAD** unresponsive to other therapies.
        - Abnormalities in liver function tests reported; restrict use to <1–2 months.
- **Treatment of acute symptomatic hyponatremia**:
    - **Hypertonic 3% saline (513 mM) to acutely increase plasma Na+ by 1–2 mM/h to a total of 4–6 mM**. This modest increase typically alleviates severe acute symptoms.
    - A **100 mL bolus of hypertonic saline is more effective than an infusion** for rapid improvement.
    - Plasma Na+ concentration should be monitored **every 2–4 h** during treatment.
    - Supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support are critical if acute pulmonary edema or hypercapneic respiratory failure develops.
    - IV loop diuretics treat pulmonary edema and increase free water excretion.
    - AVP antagonists do not have an approved role in acute hyponatremia.
- **Correction rate in chronic hyponatremia**:
    - **Comparatively slow (<6–8 mM in the first 24 h and <6 mM each subsequent 24h) to avoid ODS**. Lower rates for high-risk patients (alcoholics, hypokalemic).
    - **Overcorrection can occur when AVP levels rapidly normalize** (e.g., after IV saline for chronic hypovolemic hyponatremia, or glucocorticoid replacement).
    - **If plasma Na+ overcorrects**: Hyponatremia can be safely reinduced or stabilized by administering the **AVP agonist desmopressin acetate (DDAVP)** and/or **free water (typically IV D5W)** to prevent or reverse ODS.
    - Alternatively, marked hyponatremia can be treated with twice-daily DDAVP and hypertonic saline for controlled slow correction, reducing upfront overcorrection risk.

## HYPERNATREMIA

### Etiology

- Defined as an **increase in the plasma Na+ concentration to >145 mM**.
- Less common than hyponatremia, but associated with **mortality rates as high as 40–60%** due to underlying disease severity.
- Usually results from a **combined water and electrolyte deficit, with losses of H2O in excess of Na+**.
- Less frequently, ingestion or iatrogenic administration of excess Na+ (e.g., excessive hypertonic Na+-Cl− or Na+-HCO3− IV) can be causative.
- **Elderly individuals with reduced thirst and/or diminished access to fluids are at highest risk**.
- Rarely, central defect in hypothalamic osmoreceptor function (decreased thirst, reduced AVP secretion) occurs in adipsic DI (e.g., tumor, trauma, inflammation).
- **Water loss can be renal or nonrenal**.
    - **Insensible losses** (skin, respiratory tract) may increase with fever, exercise, heat exposure, burns, mechanical ventilation.
    - **Diarrhea is the most common gastrointestinal cause of hypernatremia**. Osmotic and viral diarrheas typically produce stools with Na+ and K+ <100 mM, leading to water loss and hypernatremia.
    - **Renal water loss**:
        - **Osmotic diuresis** secondary to hyperglycemia, excess urea, postobstructive diuresis, or mannitol (these share increased urinary solute excretion and osmolality).
        - **Water diuresis** in central or nephrogenic DI (NDI).
- **Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI)**
    - Characterized by renal resistance to AVP (partial or complete).
    - Genetic causes: Loss-of-function mutations in X-linked V2 receptor; mutations in AVP-responsive aquaporin-2 water channel; recessive deficiency of aquaporin-1 water channel.
    - **Common acquired causes**:
        - **Hypercalcemia**: Causes polyuria and NDI by downregulating transport in TALH and principal cells.
        - **Hypokalemia**: Inhibits renal response to AVP and downregulates aquaporin-2 expression.
        - **Drugs**: Lithium, ifosfamide, several antiviral agents.
            - Lithium causes NDI by inhibiting GSK3 and requires entry via ENaC; amiloride can mitigate lithium-associated NDI.
            - Lithium can cause persistent NDI due to chronic tubulointerstitial scarring.
    - **Gestational DI**: Rare complication of late-term pregnancy due to increased placental "vasopressinase" activity, reducing circulating AVP. DDAVP is effective.

### Clinical Features

- Hypernatremia increases ECF osmolality, causing an osmotic gradient, efflux of intracellular water, and cellular shrinkage.
- Symptoms are predominantly neurologic.
- **Altered mental status is the most frequent manifestation**, ranging from mild confusion to deep coma.
- Sudden shrinkage of brain cells in acute hypernatremia may lead to parenchymal/subarachnoid hemorrhages and/or subdural hematomas (primarily pediatric/neonatal patients).
- Rarely, osmotic demyelination may occur in acute hypernatremia.
- Osmotic damage to muscle membranes can cause hypernatremic rhabdomyolysis.
- Chronic hypernatremia (>48 h): Brain cells accommodate by activating membrane transporters for influx and intracellular accumulation of organic osmolytes (creatine, betaine, glutamate, myoinositol, taurine), normalizing brain volume.
    - Patients are less likely to develop severe neurologic compromise.
    - Pediatric patients (especially infants) are predisposed to cerebral edema and seizures during overly rapid hydration (overcorrection >10 mM/d).
    - In critically ill adults, recent evidence does not indicate that rapid correction is associated with higher risk for mortality, seizure, altered consciousness, or cerebral edema.
    - **It is prudent to restrict correction in adults to no more than 10 mM/d**.

### Diagnostic Approach

- History should focus on thirst, polyuria, and extrarenal water loss (e.g., diarrhea).
- Physical examination includes detailed neurologic exam and ECFV assessment; hypovolemia may be present with large water deficit.
- Accurate documentation of daily fluid intake and urine output is critical.
- **Laboratory investigation**:
    - Measurement of serum and urine osmolality, and urine electrolytes.
    - **Appropriate response to hypernatremia (serum osmolality >295 mOsm/kg)**: Increased circulating AVP and excretion of **low volumes (<500 mL/d) of maximally concentrated urine (>800 mOsm/kg)**. If this is the case, an extrarenal source of water loss is primarily responsible.
    - If polyuric:
        - Osmotic diuresis (excessive Na+-Cl−, glucose, and/or urea excretion): Daily solute excretion >750–1000 mOsm/d.
        - Predominant water diuresis: Excessive excretion of hypotonic, dilute urine.
    - **Differentiation between NDI and central DI**: Measure urinary osmolality response to DDAVP combined with circulating AVP in hypertonicity.
        - An "indirect water deprivation" test with copeptin measurement can differentiate polydipsia from central DI in hypotonic polyuria without hypernatremia.
        - **Water deprivation test is unnecessary and contraindicated in baseline hypernatremia** as it is already a strong AVP stimulus.
        - **Hypernatremic NDI patients** will have **high serum AVP and copeptin**, and their **low urine osmolality will fail to respond to DDAVP** (increasing by <50% or <150 mOsm/kg from baseline).
        - **Central DI patients** will respond to DDAVP, with reduced circulating AVP/copeptin.
    - For renal loss of water, **quantify ongoing daily losses using calculated electrolyte-free water clearance**and baseline water deficit. Requires daily urine electrolyte measurement and accurate daily urine volume.

### Treatment of Hypernatremia

- **Withdraw or correct the underlying cause** (drugs, hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, diarrhea).
- **It is imperative to correct hypernatremia slowly to avoid cerebral edema**, typically replacing the calculated free water deficit over 48 h.
    - **Plasma Na+ concentration should be corrected by no more than 10 mM/d** (may take longer than 48 h in severe hypernatremia >160 mM).
    - **Rare exception**: Acute hypernatremia (<48 h) due to sodium loading, which can be corrected rapidly at 1 mM/h.
- Water administration:
    - Ideally by mouth or nasogastric tube (most direct way to provide free water).
    - Alternatively, in dextrose-containing IV solutions (e.g., 5% dextrose [D5W]); monitor blood glucose.
    - May initially treat with hypotonic saline solutions (1/4 or 1/2 normal saline) depending on clinical status. Normal saline is usually inappropriate unless very severe hypernatremia or frank hypotension.
    - Calculation of urinary electrolyte-free water clearance is required to estimate daily, ongoing loss of free water in NDI or central DI, which should be replenished daily.
- **Additional therapy in specific cases**:
    - Central DI: Respond to intravenous, intranasal, or oral **DDAVP**.
    - NDI due to lithium: May reduce polyuria with **amiloride** (decreases lithium entry into principal cells by inhibiting ENaC).
    - **Thiazides** may reduce polyuria due to NDI by inducing hypovolemia and increasing proximal tubular water reabsorption.
    - **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** occasionally used for NDI-associated polyuria by reducing intrarenal prostaglandins.
    - **Note**: Thiazides, amiloride, and NSAIDs are for chronic management of polyuria from NDI, and have **no role in the acute management of associated hypernatremia**, where the focus is on replacing free water deficits and ongoing loss.

## POTASSIUM DISORDERS

- Plasma K+ concentration is maintained between **3.5 and 5.0 mM**.
- The **kidney plays a dominant role in potassium homeostasis**, excreting ~90% of daily intake in urine and 10% in stool.
- **>98% of total-body potassium is intracellular, chiefly in muscle**. Buffering by this large intracellular pool is crucial for regulating plasma K+.
- Changes in exchange and distribution of intra- and extracellular K+ can lead to marked hypo- or hyperkalemia.
- Massive necrosis and attendant release of tissue K+ can cause severe hyperkalemia, especially with acute kidney injury.
- **Kidney's Role in K+ Regulation**
    - Reabsorbs filtered K+ in K+-deficient states and secretes K+ in K+-replete states.
    - K+ transported along the entire nephron.
    - **Principal cells of the connecting segment (CNT) and cortical CD play a dominant role in renal K+ secretion**.
    - **==Alpha-intercalated cells of the outer medullary CD function in renal tubular reabsorption of filtered K+ in K+-deficient states.==**
    - In principal cells, apical Na+ entry via amiloride-sensitive ENaC generates a lumen-negative potential difference, driving passive K+ exit through apical K+ channels.
    - Two major K+ channels mediate distal tubular K+ secretion: **ROMK** (renal outer medullary K+ channel) mediates bulk of constitutive secretion, while the flow-sensitive **BK (maxi-K) channel** is activated by increased distal flow rate or genetic absence of ROMK.
- **Relationship between ENaC and Distal K+ Secretion**
    - **Decreased distal delivery of Na+** (e.g., hypovolemic, prerenal states) tends to **blunt K+ excretion, leading to hyperkalemia**.
    - **Increased distal delivery of Na+ and distal flow rate** (e.g., after thiazide and loop diuretics) can **enhance K+ secretion, leading to hypokalemia**.
    - Drugs that directly inhibit ENaC cause predictable hyperkalemia.
    - **Aldosterone has a major influence on potassium excretion**, increasing ENaC activity and thus amplifying the driving force for K+ secretion. Abnormalities in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can cause both hypo- and hyperkalemia.
    - Potassium excess and restriction have opposing, aldosterone-independent effects on apical K+ channels.
    - Potassium restriction and hypokalemia activate aldosterone-independent distal reabsorption of filtered K+.

### HYPOKALEMIA

- Defined as a **plasma K+ concentration of <3.5 mM**.
- Occurs in up to 20% of hospitalized patients.
- Associated with a **tenfold increase in in-hospital mortality** due to adverse effects on cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and cardiovascular morbidity.
- Caused by redistribution of K+ between tissues/ECF or by renal/nonrenal loss of K+.
- **Systemic hypomagnesemia** can cause treatment-resistant hypokalemia.
- Spurious hypokalemia ("pseudohypokalemia") can result from in vitro cellular K+ uptake after venipuncture (e.g., profound leukocytosis).
- **Redistribution and Hypokalemia**
    - **Insulin, β2-adrenergic activity, thyroid hormone, and alkalosis promote Na+/K+-ATPase-mediated cellular uptake of K+, leading to hypokalemia**.
    - Exogenous insulin can cause iatrogenic hypokalemia.
    - Stimulation of endogenous insulin can provoke hypokalemia in malnourished patients given a carbohydrate load.
    - Alterations in endogenous sympathetic nervous system activity can cause hypokalemia (e.g., alcohol withdrawal, hyperthyroidism, acute myocardial infarction, severe head injury).
    - **β2 agonists** (bronchodilators, tocolytics) are powerful activators of cellular K+ uptake; "hidden" sympathomimetics (e.g., pseudoephedrine) may also cause hypokalemia.
    - Xanthine-dependent activation of cAMP signaling can lead to hypokalemia (theophylline overdose, marked dietary caffeine overingestion).
    - **Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP)**: Redistributive hypokalemia with periodic attacks of hypokalemic paralysis in hyperthyroidism.
        - More frequent in Asian/Hispanic origin, linked to genetic variation in Kir2.6 and KCNJ2.
        - Typically presents with weakness of extremities, profound hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia.
        - Attributed to direct/indirect activation of Na+/K+-ATPase and reduced outward-directed inward-rectifying K+ current.
        - **High-dose propranolol rapidly reverses** associated hypokalemia and paralysis.
    - Familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis: Similar episodes caused by mutations in L-type calcium channels or skeletal Na+ channels.
- **Nonrenal Loss of Potassium**
    - Sweat loss is typically low except under extreme physical exertion.
    - Direct gastric losses of K+ from vomiting/nasogastric suctioning are minimal; however, **ensuing hypochloremic alkalosis results in persistent kaliuresis (renal K+ loss)**.
    - **Diarrhea is a globally important cause of hypokalemia**.
    - Noninfectious gastrointestinal processes (celiac disease, ileostomy, laxative abuse, etc.) can cause significant hypokalemia.
- **Renal Loss of Potassium**
    - **Drugs**: Common cause due to increased distal tubular Na+ delivery/flow rate and secondary hyperaldosteronism.
        - **Thiazides have a greater effect on plasma K+ concentration than loop diuretics**. Thiazides inhibit NCC, increasing Na+ delivery to principal cells, augmenting Na+ entry via ENaC, increasing lumen-negative potential difference, and amplifying K+ secretion.
        - High doses of penicillin-related antibiotics can increase obligatory K+ excretion by acting as nonreabsorbable anions.
        - Renal tubular toxins (aminoglycosides, amphotericin, cisplatin, etc.) cause renal K+ and magnesium wasting.
    - **Aldosterone**: Increases ENaC channel activity, increasing driving force for K+ excretion. Increased aldosterone bioactivity is associated with hypokalemia.
        - **Primary hyperaldosteronism**: Genetic or acquired.
            - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (defects in steroid 11β-hydroxylase or 17α-hydroxylase).
            - **Familial hyperaldosteronism type I (FH-I/GRA)**: Caused by a chimeric gene under ACTH control, repressible by glucocorticoids.
            - **Familial hyperaldosteronism type III (FH-III)**: Caused by mutations in KCNJ5 (GIRK4) leading to increased Na+ permeability, adrenal cell depolarization, and aldosterone secretion.
            - Acquired causes: Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs), idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA); often associated with somatic mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3.
        - **Plasma aldosterone:PRA ratio >50 suggests primary hyperaldosteronism**.
    - **Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid excess**:
        - **Syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (SAME)**: Recessive loss-of-function mutations in 11βHSD-2 enzyme (which normally converts cortisol to inactive cortisone), leading to cortisol-dependent MLR activation. Presents with hypertension, hypokalemia, hypercalciuria, metabolic alkalosis, suppressed PRA and aldosterone.
        - Similar syndrome caused by biochemical inhibition of 11βHSD-2 (e.g., glycyrrhizinic acid in licorice, itraconazole, posaconazole).
        - Hypokalemia is common (60–100%) in patients with ectopic ACTH secretion, likely due to reduced renal 11βHSD-2 activity, causing SAME.
    - **Defects in renal tubular transport pathways**:
        - Loss-of-function mutations in H+-ATPase subunits: Hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis.
        - **Liddle’s syndrome**: Autosomal dominant gain-in-function mutations of ENaC subunits, leading to increased expression of activated ENaC channels. Classically, severe hypertension with hypokalemia, unresponsive to spironolactone but sensitive to amiloride.
        - **Bartter’s syndrome (BS)**: Loss-of-function mutations in TALH transport proteins, causing hereditary hypokalemic alkalosis. Patients have polyuria/polydipsia, often increased urinary calcium, and activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis. Antenatal BS is severe, with polyhydramnios and nephrocalcinosis.
        - **Gitelman’s syndrome (GS)**: Loss-of-function mutations in the thiazide-sensitive NCC of the DCT. Patients are **uniformly hypomagnesemic and exhibit marked hypocalciuria** (critical diagnostic test). Milder than BS.
- **Magnesium Deficiency and Hypokalemia**
    - Magnesium depletion inhibits muscle Na+/K+-ATPase and causes exaggerated K+ secretion by the distal nephron (due to reduced magnesium-dependent block of ROMK channel).
    - **Hypomagnesemic patients are refractory to K+ replacement alone; concomitant Mg2+ deficiency must be corrected**.

### Clinical Features of Hypokalemia

- Prominent effects on cardiac, skeletal, and intestinal muscle cells.
- **Cardiac**: Major risk factor for **ventricular and atrial arrhythmias**. Predisposes to digoxin toxicity.
    - **ECG changes**: broad flat T waves, ST depression, and QT prolongation (most marked when serum K+ <2.7 mmol/L).
    - Can precipitate arrhythmia in patients with other QT prolongation causes.
- **Skeletal muscle**: Hypokalemia results in hyperpolarization, impairing depolarization and contraction; weakness and even paralysis may ensue. Causes skeletal myopathy and predisposes to rhabdomyolysis.
- **Intestinal smooth muscle**: Paralytic effects may cause intestinal ileus.
- **Kidney functional effects**: Na+-Cl− and HCO3− retention, polyuria, phosphaturia, hypocitraturia, and activation of renal ammoniagenesis.
    - Bicarbonate retention and other acid-base effects contribute to metabolic alkalosis.
    - Hypokalemic polyuria is due to central polydipsia and an AVP-resistant renal concentrating defect.
- **Kidney structural changes**: Vacuolizing injury to proximal tubular cells, interstitial nephritis, and renal cysts.
- Predisposes to acute kidney injury and can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in long-standing cases.
- Implicated in pathophysiology and progression of hypertension, heart failure, vascular disease, and stroke. Correction improves blood pressure in hypertensive patients on diuretics.

### Diagnostic Approach to Hypokalemia

- Cause usually evident from history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests.
- History focuses on medications, diet, and symptoms. Physical examination focuses on BP, volume status, and signs of specific disorders.
- Initial laboratory evaluation: electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, serum osmolality, Mg2+, Ca2+, CBC, and urinary pH, osmolality, creatinine, and electrolytes.
- Non–anion gap acidosis: Suggests distal, hypokalemic renal tubular acidosis or diarrhea; urinary anion gap helps differentiate.
- Renal K+ excretion assessed with 24-h urine collection: **<15 mmol indicates an extrarenal cause**.
- Random spot urine sample:
    - Transtubular K+ gradient (TTKG) should be **<3 in hypokalemia**.
    - **Urinary K+-to-creatinine ratio >13 mmol/g creatinine** is compatible with excessive renal K+ excretion.
- Urine Cl− is usually decreased in hypokalemia from a nonreabsorbable anion (e.g., antibiotics or HCO3−).
- Most common chronic hypokalemic alkalosis causes: surreptitious vomiting, diuretic abuse, and GS (distinguished by urinary electrolytes).
- Other tests (urinary Ca2+, thyroid function, PRA/aldosterone levels) may be appropriate.
    - **Plasma aldosterone:PRA ratio >50 suggests hyperaldosteronism**.
    - Genetic testing for FH-I/GRA, SAME, Liddle’s syndrome may be needed. Liddle’s responds to amiloride but not spironolactone; SAME responds to spironolactone.

### Treatment of Hypokalemia

- Goals: **prevent life-threatening/serious chronic consequences, replace K+ deficit, and correct the underlying cause**.
- Urgency depends on severity, associated clinical factors (cardiac disease, digoxin therapy), and rate of decline in serum K+.
- Continuous cardiac telemetry for patients with prolonged QT or arrhythmia risk factors.
- Urgent but cautious K+ replacement for severe redistributive hypokalemia (plasma K+ <2.5 mM) or serious complications. Risk of rebound hyperkalemia.
- High-dose propranolol (3 mg/kg) for redistributive hypokalemia from excessive sympathetic nervous system activity (TPP, theophylline overdose, acute head injury).
- **Oral replacement with K+-Cl− is the mainstay of therapy**.
- Potassium phosphate for combined hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia; potassium bicarbonate/citrate for metabolic acidosis.
- **Hypomagnesemic patients are refractory to K+ replacement alone; concomitant Mg2+ deficiency must be corrected**.
- K+ deficit estimation: Serum K+ drops by **~0.27 mM for every 100-mmol reduction in total-body stores**. Loss of 400–800 mmol total-body K+ reduces serum K+ by ~2.0 mM.
- **Deficit must be replaced gradually over 24–48 h** with frequent monitoring due to delay in redistributing potassium into intracellular compartments.
- **Intravenous administration**: Limited to patients unable to use the enteral route or with severe complications (paralysis, arrhythmia).
    - **Always administer K+-Cl− in saline solutions, rather than dextrose** (dextrose-induced insulin can acutely exacerbate hypokalemia).
    - Peripheral IV dose: Usually 20–40 mmol K+-Cl− per liter. Higher concentrations cause pain/phlebitis.
    - Severe (<2.5 mmol/L) or critically symptomatic hypokalemia: IV K+-Cl− through central vein with cardiac monitoring, at 10–20 mmol/h. Higher rates for life-threatening complications only.
- Strategies to minimize K+ losses: Minimize non-K+-sparing diuretics, restrict Na+ intake, use K+-sparing medications (e.g., loop diuretics with ACE inhibitors).

### HYPERKALEMIA

- Defined as a **plasma potassium level of ≥5.5 mM**.
- Occurs in up to 10% of hospitalized patients; severe hyperkalemia (>6.0 mM) in ~1%, with significantly increased mortality risk.
- **A decrease in renal K+ excretion is the most frequent underlying cause**.
- Excessive intake is a rare cause, but can affect susceptible patients (e.g., diabetics with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, CKD).
- Drugs that impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis are a major cause.
- **Pseudohyperkalemia**: Artifactual increase in serum K+ due to K+ release during/after venipuncture.
    - Causes: Excessive muscle activity, marked increase in cellular elements (thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, erythrocytosis), acute anxiety, cooling of blood.
    - Genetic subtypes exist (e.g., mutations in red cell anion exchanger AE1).
- **Redistribution and Hyperkalemia**
    - **Acidemia**: Associated with cellular uptake of H+ and K+ efflux. This effect is limited to non–anion gap metabolic acidosis and, to a lesser extent, respiratory acidosis; **does not occur in lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis**.
    - Hypertonic mannitol, hypertonic saline, intravenous immune globulin: "Solvent drag" effect.
    - Diabetics prone to osmotic hyperkalemia in response to IV hypertonic glucose without adequate insulin.
    - Cationic amino acids (lysine, arginine, epsilon-aminocaproic acid) cause K+ efflux.
    - **Digoxin overdose**: Inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase, impairing K+ uptake, causing hyperkalemia.
    - Fluoride poisoning: Inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase, associated with hyperkalemia.
    - **Succinylcholine**: Depolarizes muscle cells, causing K+ efflux through acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). **Contraindicated in patients with thermal trauma, neuromuscular injury, etc.** due to upregulated AChRs leading to exaggerated K+ efflux and acute hyperkalemia.
- **Excess Intake or Tissue Necrosis**
    - Increased K+ intake can provoke severe hyperkalemia in predisposed patients (e.g., K+-rich foods, salt substitutes, K+-containing medications).
    - Red cell transfusion is a well-described cause, typically in massive transfusions.
    - **Severe tissue necrosis (acute tumor lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis) predictably causes hyperkalemia**from intracellular K+ release.
- **Hypoaldosteronism and Hyperkalemia**
    - Aldosterone release may be reduced by hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, medications, primary hypoaldosteronism, or isolated ACTH deficiency.
    - Primary hypoaldosteronism: Commonly autoimmunity (Addison’s disease).
    - Medications (e.g., heparin) can cause selective inhibition of aldosterone synthesis.
    - **Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism is a common predisposing factor in diabetics, the elderly, and patients with renal insufficiency**.
        - Classically: suppressed PRA and aldosterone. ~50% have associated acidosis.
- **Renal Disease and Hyperkalemia**
    - **Chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease are very common causes**.
    - More common in oliguric acute kidney injury.
    - Hyperkalemia out of proportion to GFR seen in tubulointerstitial disease affecting the distal nephron (e.g., amyloidosis, sickle cell anemia).
    - **Hereditary renal causes ("pseudohypoaldosteronism," PHA)**: Overlapping features with hypoaldosteronism.
        - **PHA type I**: Autosomal recessive (mutations in ENaC subunits) causing lifelong salt wasting, hypotension, hyperkalemia; autosomal dominant (mutations in MLR) with phenotype improving in adulthood.
        - **PHA type II ("hereditary hypertension with hyperkalemia")**: Mirror image of Gitelman’s syndrome; clinical phenotype includes hypertension, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, suppressed PRA/aldosterone, hypercalciuria, reduced bone density.
            - Behaves like a gain of function in NCC; **treatment with thiazides resolves the entire phenotype**. Caused by mutations in WNK1, WNK4 kinases or KLHL3, CUL3 proteins.
- **Medication-Associated Hyperkalemia**
    - Most cause inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (e.g., **ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, renin inhibitors, MLRs**).
    - Oral contraceptive Yasmin-28 (drospirenone) inhibits the MLR.
    - Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, NSAIDs, COX2 inhibitors can cause hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.
    - **Inhibition of apical ENaC activity** (e.g., by amiloride and other K+-sparing diuretics, or antibiotics TMP and pentamidine) results in hyperkalemia. Nafamostat (protease inhibitor) indirectly inhibits ENaC.

### Clinical Features of Hyperkalemia

- **Hyperkalemia is a medical emergency due to its effects on the heart**.
- Cardiac arrhythmias: sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole.
- Mild increases affect repolarization (T-wave morphology changes); further increases depress intracardiac conduction (PR and QRS prolongation).
- **Severe hyperkalemia**: Loss of P wave, progressive QRS complex widening; sine-wave sinoventricular rhythm suggests impending ventricular fibrillation or asystole.
- Can cause a **type I Brugada pattern in the ECG**.
- **Classic ECG progression**: Tall peaked T waves (5.5–6.5 mM) -> loss of P waves (6.5–7.5 mM) -> widened QRS (7.0–8.0 mM) -> sine wave pattern (>8.0 mM). **These changes are notoriously insensitive**, especially in CKD/ESRD patients.
- Can present with **ascending paralysis** (secondary hyperkalemic paralysis), including diaphragmatic paralysis and respiratory failure.
- Familial hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP): Myopathic weakness during hyperkalemia due to an inactivation defect in the skeletal Na+ channel (SCN4A gene mutations).
- Hyperkalemia can contribute to **metabolic acidosis** by negatively affecting the ability to excrete an acid load. Restoration of normokalemia can correct this acidosis.

### Diagnostic Approach to Hyperkalemia

- **First priority**: Assess the need for emergency treatment, then conduct a comprehensive workup.
- History/physical examination focuses on medications, diet, kidney failure risk factors, urine output, BP, volume status.
- Initial laboratory tests: electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, serum osmolality, Mg2+ and Ca2+, CBC, and urinary pH, osmolality, creatinine, and electrolytes.
- Urine Na+ concentration <20 mM indicates distal Na+ delivery is limiting K+ excretion.
- Serum and urine osmolality are required for TTKG calculation.
    - **TTKG expected values**: <3 in hypokalemia and **>7–8 in hyperkalemia**.
    - Despite theoretical criticisms, TTKG remains a helpful bedside test of urinary potassium excretion in hyperkalemia.

### Treatment of Hyperkalemia

- **ECG manifestations of hyperkalemia are a medical emergency** and require urgent treatment.
- **Significant hyperkalemia (plasma K+ ≥6.5 mM) without ECG changes should also be aggressively managed**due to ECG limitations as a predictor of cardiac toxicity.
- Urgent management includes hospital admission, continuous cardiac monitoring, and immediate treatment.
- **Treatment is divided into three stages**:
    1. **Immediate antagonism of the cardiac effects**:
        - **Intravenous calcium serves to protect the heart**. It raises the action potential threshold and reduces excitability.
        - **Recommended dose is 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate** (or 3–4 mL of calcium chloride) infused IV over 2–3 min with cardiac monitoring.
        - Effect starts in 1–3 min and lasts 30–60 min; dose can be repeated.
        - Use with extreme caution in digoxin patients (hypercalcemia potentiates digoxin toxicity); infuse slowly.
    2. **Rapid reduction in plasma K+ concentration by redistribution into cells**:
        - **Insulin lowers plasma K+ by shifting K+ into cells**.
            - **Recommended dose is 10 units of intravenous regular insulin followed immediately by 50 mL of 50% dextrose (D50W, 25 g of glucose)**.
            - Effect begins in 10–20 min, peaks at 30–60 min, and lasts for 4–6 h.
            - **Bolus D50W without insulin is never appropriate** due to risk of worsening hyperkalemia.
            - Monitor plasma glucose closely; follow with 10% dextrose infusion to prevent hypoglycemia.
            - For patients with glucose ≥200–250 mg/dL, insulin should be given without glucose.
        - **β2-Agonists (albuterol)** are effective.
            - Additive effect with insulin and glucose. ~20% of ESRD patients are resistant; do not use without insulin.
            - Recommended dose for inhaled albuterol is 10–20 mg nebulized in 4 mL normal saline over 10 min.
            - Effect starts ~30 min, peaks ~90 min, lasts 2–6 h. Side effects include hyperglycemia and tachycardia; use with caution in cardiac disease.
        - Intravenous bicarbonate has no role in acute treatment but may slowly attenuate hyperkalemia with sustained administration. Not to be given as undiluted bolus; infuse in isotonic or hypotonic fluid.
    3. **Removal of potassium**: Typically using cation exchange resins, diuretics, and/or dialysis.
        - **Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS)**: Exchanges Na+ for K+ in the GI tract, increasing fecal K+ excretion.
            - Effect is slow (full effect up to 24 h); usually requires repeated doses.
            - **Intestinal necrosis is a rare but usually fatal complication of SPS**. Risk increased with sorbitol co-administration or reduced intestinal motility.
            - Alternative therapies are preferred for acute management whenever possible.
        - **Novel intestinal potassium binders** (e.g., **Patiromer, ZS-9 [sodium zirconium cyclosilicate]**) are now available. They lack SPS intestinal toxicity and are preferred.
            - Patiromer binds K+ in exchange for Ca2+; major side effect is hypomagnesemia.
            - ZS-9 exchanges Na+ and H+ for K+ and NH4+.
            - These agents have revolutionized management of both chronic and acute hyperkalemia.
        - Intravenous saline: Beneficial in hypovolemic patients with oliguria and decreased distal Na+ delivery.
        - Loop and thiazide diuretics: Reduce plasma K+ in volume-replete or hypervolemic patients with sufficient renal function. May need to be combined with IV saline or isotonic bicarbonate to maintain euvolemia.
        - **Hemodialysis is the most effective and reliable method to reduce plasma K+ concentration**. Peritoneal dialysis is less effective.
        - Amount of K+ removed during hemodialysis depends on K+ distribution, dialyzer type, flow rates, duration, and K+ gradient.

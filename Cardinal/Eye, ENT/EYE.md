# Disorder 
## Transient or Sudden Visual Loss 
### Amaurosis Fugax 
- TIA of retina 
- more than few second ischemia --> transient monocular blindness --> aka Amaurosis Fugax 
- rapid fading of vision like a curtain descending, sometimes affecting only a portion of the visual field 
- Embolus (cholesterol --> Hollenhorst plaque , calcium, platelet-fibrin) in retinal arteriole --> if breaks, vision restored , if prolonged --> ***inner retina infarct***
- Appearace 
	- BRAO --> zones of whitened, edematous retina following the distribution 
	- CRAO --> arrest of blood flow and a milky retina with a cherry-red fovea 
- M/C source -->
	- atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery or aorta, 
	- can arise from the heart, especially in patients with diseased valves, atrial fibrillation, or wall motion abnormalities
- rarely low central retinal artery perfusion --> critical stenosis of IL carotid with poor collateral from circle of willis --> slight dip in BP or worsening stenosis --> precipitates 
- rare 
	- retinal migraine 
	- SLE 
	- Anti-cardiolipin abs 
	- protein C, S deficiency , antithrombin deficiency 
	- susacs syndrome 
	- pregnancy 
	- IV drug use 
	- Dysproteinemias 
	- temporal arteritis 
- Systemic Hypertension 
	- sclerosis of retinal arterioles, splinter hemorrhages, **focal infarcts of the nerve fiber layer (cotton-wool spots)**, and **leakage of lipid and fluid (hard exudate) into the macula** 
	- Crisis --> retinal arteriole vasospasm --> visual loss 
	- Ischemic optic disc swelling 
	- avoid rapid l

# Disorder 
## Transient or Sudden Visual Loss 
### Amaurosis Fugax 
- TIA of retina 
- more than few second ischemia --> transient monocular blindness --> aka Amaurosis Fugax 
- rapid fading of vision like a curtain descending, sometimes affecting only a portion of the visual field 
- Embolus (cholesterol --> Hollenhorst plaque , calcium, platelet-fibrin) in retinal arteriole --> if breaks, vision restored , if prolonged --> ***inner retina infarct***
- Appearace 
	- BRAO --> zones of whitened, edematous retina following the distribution 
	- CRAO --> arrest of blood flow and a milky retina with a cherry-red fovea 
- M/C source -->
	- atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery or aorta, 
	- can arise from the heart, especially in patients with diseased valves, atrial fibrillation, or wall motion abnormalities
- rarely low central retinal artery perfusion --> critical stenosis of IL carotid with poor collateral from circle of willis --> slight dip in BP or worsening stenosis --> precipitates 
- rare 
	- retinal migraine 
	- SLE 
	- Anti-cardiolipin abs 
	- protein C, S deficiency , antithrombin deficiency 
	- susacs syndrome 
	- pregnancy 
	- IV drug use 
	- Dysproteinemias 
	- temporal arteritis 
- Systemic Hypertension 
	- sclerosis of retinal arterioles, splinter hemorrhages, **focal infarcts of the nerve fiber layer (cotton-wool spots)**, and **leakage of lipid and fluid (hard exudate) into the macula** 
	- Crisis --> retinal arteriole vasospasm --> visual loss 
	- Ischemic optic disc swelling 
	- avoid rapid lowering of BP --> may cause disc infarct 
- Impending Branch/ Central Vein occlusion 
	- similar symptoms  
	- veins appear engorged and phlebitic, with numerous retinal hemorrhages 
	- some evolve a frank obstruction with extensive retinal bleeding (“blood and thunder” appearance), infarction, and visual loss. 
	- idiopathic , HTN, diabetes , glaucoma 
	- polycythemia , thrombocytopenia 
	- Aspirin 
### Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy 
- insufficient blood flow through the posterior ciliary arteries that supply the optic disc 
- painless monocular vision loss, sudden onset, stuttering progress 
- edematous disc with nerve fiber layer splinter hemorrhage 
- ***Non-Arteritic***
	- more common 
	- Diabetes , renal failure , hypertension are risk factor 
	- +/- a/w erectile dysfunction drugs 
	- crowded disc architecture and small optic cup --> increase risk --> if in 1 eye, more risk in 2nd eye 
	- no treatment 
	- steroids contraindicated 
- ***Arteritic*** 
	- 5% 
	- a/w Giant cell temporal arteritis 
	- **High dose glucocorticoid to prevent blindness in 2nd eye** 
	- Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor mab)--> alternate to steroid 
	- polymyalgia rheumatica maybe seen --> ESR, CRP elevated 
	- temporal artery biopsy mandatory 
		- as early as possible as steroids may change 
		- 3cm long 
		- histologic features of granulomatous inflammation 
		- if biopsy negative --> stop steroid 
	- glucocorticoid without awaiting biopsy 
### Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy 
- Uncommon 
- severe anemia + hypotension 
- after major blood loss --> surgery , shock, GI bleed, dialysis 
- normal fundus 
- optic disc swelling only if anterior extension to globe 
- immediate blood transfusion + reverse hypotension --> maybe vision salvage 
### Optic Neuritis 
- Inflammatory disease of optic nerve 
- common 
- mean age of patients was 32 years, 77% were female, 92% had ocular pain (especially with eye movements), and 35% had optic disc swelling 
- mostly retrobulbar demyelinating pathology --> fundus normal initially --> pallor over several months 
- gradual recovery after single episode without treatment takes months 
- if no improvement after 1st attack --> doubtful diagnosis 
- high- dose IV methylprednisolone (250 mg every 6 h for 3 days) followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg per day for 11 days) --> no difference in final vision but faster recovery 
- 15-year cumulative probability of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis after optic neuritis is 50%. 
- MRI in all --> 2 or more plaque --> treat MS 
- NMO 
	- bilateral 
	- a/w myelitis 
	- primary or autoimmune or paraneoplastic 
	- circulating antibodies directed against aquaporin-4 or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is diagnostic. 
	- Treatment for acute episodes consists of glucocorticoids followed by satralizumab, eculizumab, or inebilizumab to prevent relapse
## Lebers Hereditary Optic Neuropathy 
- young men 
- Progressive painless severe central vision loss in eye --> weeks to years later in other 
- disc appears mildly plethoric with surface capillary telangiectasias but no vascular leakage on fluorescein angiography 
- eventually optic atrophy 
- NADH subunit 4 gene mutation (point)
- Mitochondrial mutation + 
### Toxic Optic Neuropathy 
- acute visual loss with bilateral optic disc swelling and cecocentral scotomas 
- visual loss also can develop gradually and produce optic atrophy without a phase of acute optic disc edema
- Agents 
	- ethambutol 
	- methyl alcohol 
	- ethyl alcohol 
	- Carbon Monoxide 
	- disulfiram, ethchlorvynol, chloramphenicol, amiodarone, monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody, ciprofloxacin, digitalis, streptomycin, lead, arsenic, thallium, D-penicillamine, isoniazid, emetine, and sulfonamides
	- Metallosis (chromium, cobalt, nickel) from hip implant failure is a rare
- Deficiency state (starvation , malabsorption, alcoholism , gastric bypass) --> check thiamine , B12, folate levels 
### Papilledema 
- Bilateral optic disc swelling from raised ICP (if other cause --> optic disc swelling)
- Headache common but maybe absent 
- transient visual obscurations classic --> one eye or both simultaneously 
	- usually last seconds 
	- afer abrupt posture changes or spontaneous 
	- prolonged or spontaneous obscurations --> threatening papilledema 
- vision normal unless 
	- severe or long-standing papilledema 
	- macular edema 
	- hemorrhage 
- enlarged blind spots & peripheral constriction 
- unremitting papilledema, peripheral visual field loss progresses in an insidious fashion with optic nerve atrophy -->  reduction of optic disc swelling is an ***ominous sign of a dying nerve*** rather than an encouraging indication of resolving papilledema
- neuroimaging to exclude an intracranial lesion. 
- Noninvasive MR vascular imaging to search for a dural venous sinus thrombosis or an arteriovenous shunt
- if radiology negative --> subarachnoid opening pressure --> increased pressure + normal CSF --> Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension 
	- females 
	- obese 
	- carbonic anhydrase inhibitor like acetazolamide  --> reduces ICP by reducing CSF production 
	- weight reduction 
	- severe or progressive vision loss --> shunt / stent across transverse and sigmoid sinus 
	- optic nerve sheath fenestration 
### Optic Disc Drusen 
- Refractile, glittering particles in substance of optic nerve head 
- visible on surface --> if hidden --> pseudopapilledema --> B-ultrasound to detect --> hyperechoic (calcium containing ) 
- visible on CT and OCT 
- perimetry --> they give rise to enlarged blind spots and arcuate scotomas from damage to the optic disc
- Hemorrhage, choroidal neovascular membrane, and AION are more likely to occur in patients with optic disc drusen.
- No treatment available 
### Vitreous Degeneration 
- All individuals with age 
- opacities in vitreous --> shadows on retina 
- distracting “floaters” move synchronously with eye movement, with a slight lag caused by inertia of the vitreous gel 
- perception of flashing lights --> brief and unilateral 
- contraction --> vitreous detachment --> harmless unless retinal damage 
- fundus --> peripheral tears or holes --> laser application 
- tear ruptures retinal blood vessel --> vitreous hemorrhage --> sudden loss of vision 
	- fundus hidden by blood 
	- USG required 
	- if spontaneous resolution doesnt occur --> surgical removal 
### Retinal Detachment 
- floaters, flashing lights, and a scotoma in the peripheral visual field corresponding to the detachment 
- If fovea involved --> RAPD, reduced acuity 
- rhegmatogenous retinal detachment --> starts with a hole, flap, or tear in the peripheral retina 
- more common in lattice degeneration (peripheral retinal thinning )

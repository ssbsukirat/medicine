# Disorder 
## Transient or Sudden Visual Loss 
### Amaurosis Fugax 
- TIA of retina 
- more than few second ischemia --> transient monocular blindness --> aka Amaurosis Fugax 
- rapid fading of vision like a curtain descending, sometimes affecting only a portion of the visual field 
- Embolus (cholesterol --> Hollenhorst plaque , calcium, platelet-fibrin) in retinal arteriole --> if breaks, vision restored , if prolonged --> ***inner retina infarct***
- Appearace 
	- BRAO --> zones of whitened, edematous retina following the distribution 
	- CRAO --> arrest of blood flow and a milky retina with a cherry-red fovea 
- M/C source -->
	- atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery or aorta, 
	- can arise from the heart, especially in patients with diseased valves, atrial fibrillation, or wall motion abnormalities
- rarely low central retinal artery perfusion --> critical stenosis of IL carotid with poor collateral from circle of willis --> slight dip in BP or worsening stenosis --> precipitates 
- rare 
	- retinal migraine 
	- SLE 
	- Anti-cardiolipin abs 
	- protein C, S deficiency , antithrombin deficiency 
	- susacs syndrome 
	- pregnancy 
	- IV drug use 
	- Dysproteinemias 
	- temporal arteritis 
- Systemic Hypertension 
	- sclerosis of retinal arterioles, splinter hemorrhages, **focal infarcts of the nerve fiber layer (cotton-wool spots)**, and **leakage of lipid and fluid (hard exudate) into the macula** 
	- Crisis --> retinal arteriole vasospasm --> visual loss 
	- Ischemic optic disc swelling 
	- avoid rapid lowering of BP --> may cause disc infarct 
- Impending Branch/ Central Vein occlusion 
	- similar symptoms  
	- veins appear engorged and phlebitic, with numerous retinal hemorrhages 
	- some evolve a frank obstruction with extensive retinal bleeding (“blood and thunder” appearance), infarction, and visual loss. 
	- idiopathic , HTN, diabetes , glaucoma 
	- polycythemia , thrombocytopenia 
	- Aspirin 
### Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy 
- insufficient blood flow through the posterior ciliary arteries that supply the optic disc 
- painless monocular vision loss, sudden onset, stuttering progress 
- edematous disc with nerve fiber layer splinter hemorrhage 
- ***Non-Arteritic***
	- more common 
	- Diabetes , renal failure , hypertension are risk factor 
	- +/- a/w erectile dysfunction drugs 
	- crowded disc architecture and small optic cup --> increase risk --> if in 1 eye, more risk in 2nd eye 
	- no treatment 
	- steroids contraindicated 
- ***Arteritic*** 
	- 5% 
	- a/w Giant cell temporal arteritis 
	- **High dose glucocorticoid to prevent blindness in 2nd eye** 
	- Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor mab)--> alternate to steroid 
	- polymyalgia rheumatica maybe seen --> ESR, CRP elevated 
	- temporal artery biopsy mandatory 
		- as early as possible as steroids may change 
		- 3cm long 
		- histologic features of granulomatous inflammation 
		- if biopsy negative --> stop steroid 
	- glucocorticoid without awaiting biopsy 
### Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy 
- Uncommon 
- severe anemia + hypotension 
- after major blood loss --> surgery , shock, GI bleed, dialysis 
- normal fundus 
- optic disc swelling only if

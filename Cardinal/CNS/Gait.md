# Anatomy and Physiology 
- Step **generation** by locomotor centers in the pontine **tegmentum, midbrain, and subthalamic** region 
- Step **modification** by **brainstem, cerebellum and forebrain**. 
- Step synergies integrated by reticular formation and descending pathways in ventromedial spinal cord. 
## Postural Control 
 - Centre of mass over the base of support needs to be maintained 
 - in legs, **110ms** needed to respond to disturbance 
 - Forward motion --> propulsive force for steps --> if too much, instability and fall may occur. 
 - **Vestibular nucleus and midline cerebellum contribute to balance control**  
## Standing Balance
- good-quality sensory information about the position of the body center with respect to the environment, support surface, and gravitational forces is needed 
- Sensory by 
	- **visual** 
	- **vestibular and** 
	- **proprioceptive systems.** 
- If **2/3 systems lost** --> compromised standing balance

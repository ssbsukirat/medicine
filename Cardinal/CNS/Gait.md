# Anatomy and Physiology 
- Step **generation** by locomotor centers in the pontine **tegmentum, midbrain, and subthalamic** region 
- Step **modification** by **brainstem, cerebellum and forebrain**. 
- Step synergies integrated by reticular formation and descending pathways in ventromedial spinal cord. 
- Walking considered an unconscious activity and automatic ,
- ***walking while doing cognitive task is dual task walking*** and maybe compromised in elderly. 
## Postural Control 
 - Centre of mass over the base of support needs to be maintained 
 - in legs, **110ms** needed to respond to disturbance 
 - Forward motion --> propulsive force for steps --> if too much, instability and fall may occur. 
 - **Vestibular nucleus and midline cerebellum contribute to balance control**  
## Standing Balance
- good-quality sensory information about the position of the body center with respect to the environment, support surface, and gravitational forces is needed 
- Sensory by 
	- **visual** 
	- **vestibular and** 
	- **proprioceptive systems.** 
- If **2/3 systems lost** --> compromised standing balance 
# Gait Disorder 
- Maybe neurological or non-neurological 
- **Asymmetry** is a common feature of gait disorders due to **contractures and other orthopedic deformities** 
- ***The gait disorder observed clinically must be viewed as the product of a neurologic deficit and a functional adaptation*** 
## Cautious Gait 
- **abbreviated stride, widened base, and lowered center of mass, as if walking on a slippery surface**
- Arms abducted 
- non-specific and common in 1/3 with gait impairment  
- a/w fear of falls
- Physical therapy --> improve walking --> follow-up observation --> identify underlying cause 
## Stiff Legged Gait

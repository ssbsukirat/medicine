# Anatomy and Physiology 
- Step **generation** by locomotor centers in the pontine **tegmentum, midbrain, and subthalamic** region 
- Step **modification** by **brainstem, cerebellum and forebrain**. 
- Step synergies integrated by reticular formation and descending pathways in ventromedial spinal cord.

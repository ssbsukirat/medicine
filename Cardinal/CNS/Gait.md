# Anatomy and Physiology 
- Step **generation** by locomotor centers in the pontine **tegmentum, midbrain, and subthalamic** region 
- Step **modification** by **brainstem, cerebellum and forebrain**. 
- Step synergies integrated by reticular formation and descending pathways in ventromedial spinal cord. 
- Walking considered an unconscious activity and automatic ,
- ***walking while doing cognitive task is dual task walking*** and maybe compromised in elderly. 
## Postural Control 
 - Centre of mass over the base of support needs to be maintained 
 - in legs, **110ms** needed to respond to disturbance 
 - Forward motion --> propulsive force for steps --> if too much, instability and fall may occur. 
 - **Vestibular nucleus and midline cerebellum contribute to balance control**  
## Standing Balance
- good-quality sensory information about the position of the body center with respect to the environment, support surface, and gravitational forces is needed 
- Sensory by 
	- **visual** 
	- **vestibular and** 
	- **proprioceptive systems.** 
- If **2/3 systems lost** --> compromised standing balance 
# Gait Disorder 
- Maybe neurological or non-neurological 
- **Asymmetry** is a common feature of gait disorders due to **contractures and other orthopedic deformities** 
- ***The gait disorder observed clinically must be viewed as the product of a neurologic deficit and a functional adaptation*** 
## Cautious Gait 
- **abbreviated stride, widened base, and lowered center of mass, as if walking on a slippery surface**
- Arms abducted 
- non-specific and common in 1/3 with gait impairment  
- a/w fear of falls
- Physical therapy --> improve walking --> follow-up observation --> identify underlying cause 
## Stiff Legged / Spastic Gait 
- Stiff legs, imbalance in muscle tone 
- **circumduction and scuffing of feet** 
- may walk on toes 
- **Scissoring** gait - if **increased** tone in **adductors** leading to leg crossing 
- Spinal / Myelopathy 
	- cervical spondylosis in elderly 
	- trauma or demyelination in younger 
	- rule out tumor or spinal vascular malformation 
- Cerebral 
	- **assymetric** , **upper**-extremity involvement  
	- **dysarthria** 
	- stroke, MS, MND, Cerebral palsy 
- Dystonia 
	- disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions resulting in repetitive twisting movements and abnormal posture
	- genetic mostly 
	- plantar flexion and inversion of feet with torsion of trunk 
- Stiff-Person Syndrome 
	- autoimmune 
	- exaggerated lordosis of the lumbar spine and overactivation of antagonist muscles restrict trunk and lower-limb movement and result in a wooden or fixed posture 
## Parkinsons, Freezing Gait 
- Festinating - accelerating with walking 
- retropulsion 
- tendency to turn en bloc 
- step to step variability contribute to falls 
- improve with dopamine and cholinesterase inhibitor 
- Freezing 
	- brief, episodic absence of forward progression of the feet, **despite the intention to walk** 
	- triggered by crowd or narrow areas 
	- improves with visual cueing 
	- 1/4 of PD 
	- end of dose freezing improve with dopaminergic or MAO-B inhibitor 
	- A/w PSP, MSA, CBD 
	- PSP - **more erect gait than PD and more falls.** 
	- vascular PD - broad based shuffling with bilateral reduced arm swing & **disproportionate gait involvement early** 
- Huntington Disease - unpredictable choreic movements --> dancing quality 
- Tardive Dyskinesias --> cause of many odd, stereotypic gait disorders seen in patients chronically exposed to antipsychotics and other drugs that block the D2 dopamine receptor
- Orthostatic tremor is a high-frequency, low-amplitude tremor predominantly involving the lower extremities.
## Frontal Gait Disorder (Higher-level gait disorder)
- shuffling , freezing gait with imbalance a/w signs of cerebral dysfunction 
- wide based, short stride, shuffling along floor, ***difficult starts and turns*** 
- "slipping clutch" inability to start gait 
- aka **lower body parkinsons** 
- higher-level motor control disorder, as opposed to an apraxia (but still called **Gait Apraxia**) 
- M/c due to vascular disease - subcortical small-vessel disease in deep white frontal matter
- NPH may have similar gait 
## Cerebellar Gait 
- **wide base** of support, **lateral instability** of the trunk, erratic foot placement, and **decompensation of balance when attempting to walk on a narrow base**
- Difficulty maintaining balance when turning 
- unable to walk tandem heel to toe and display truncal sway in narrow-based or tandem stance 
- Stroke, trauma, tumour, MSA, hereditary 
- Alcohol 
- Fragile X permutation 
## Sensory Ataxia 
- Tabes Dorsalis, Vit B12 neuropathy
- destabilize by closing eyes 
- ![[gaittable.png]]
## Neuromuscular Disease 
- Steppage Gait 
	- distal weakness 
	- step height increased to compensate foot drop and sole of foot may slap floor while weight bearing 
- Myopathy or dystrophy have proximal weakness 
- Hip girdle - excess pelvic sway during locomotion 
- stooped posture of **lumbar spinal stenosis** ameliorates pain from the compression of the cauda equina occurring with a more upright posture while walking and **may mimic early parkinsonism.** 
## Toxic and Metabolic 
- altered sensorium , asterixis , myoclonus maybe seen 
- more in renal and hepatic failure 
- neuroleptic and benzodiazepines increase fall risk 
## Functional Gait Disor

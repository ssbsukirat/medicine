- Dizziness imprecise symptom including
	- Vertigo 
	- Lightheadedness (classic means presyncopal sensation due to brain hypoperfusion)
	- Faintness
	- Imbalance
- Vertigo is sense of spinning or other motion that maybe physiological (sustained head rotation) or pathological (vestibular dysfunction)
- Many causes
	- Peripheral disorders that affect Labrinth or vestibular nerves 
	- Central vestibular pathway disruption
	- Paroxysmal 
	- Fixed unilateral or bilateral vestibular deficit 
	- Acute unilateral lesions cause due to imbalance in input
	- Bilateral lesions cause imbalance and instability of vision (***==oscillopsia==***) due to loss of normal vestibular reflexes 
- Presyncopal Dizziness
	- Cardiac dysrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, medication or other cause of brain hypoperfusion
	- Vary in duration 
	- May increase in severity till loss of consciousness or may resolve spontaneous
	- Consider in patients with episode of dizziness in upright position
- Questions
	- Dangerous (dysrhythmias, TIA or stroke)
	- Vestibular? 
	- If vestibular, peripheral or central! 
# Approach
- History 
	- Unilateral or bilateral, acute or chronic
	- Vertigo is illusion of self or environmental motion 
	- Symmetric bilateral vestibular dysfunction causes imbalance but not vertigo 
	- History is unreliable due to imprecise symptom
	- Dizziness
		- Episodes lasting seconds, minutes, hours or days 
		- Seconds 
			- BPPV 
			- Orthostatic hypotension 
			- Both provoked by change in head or body posture 
		- Minutes 
			- Posterior circulation TIAs 
			- Migraine
		- Hours 
			- Vestibular migraine
			- Menieres disease
	- Peripheral vs Central 
		- Unilateral hearing loss and acute aural symptoms (ear pain, pressure, fullness, tinnitus) point to peripheral 
		- Double vision, ataxia, numbness imply central cause 
- Examination
	- Neurological examination important 
	- Assess eye movements, vestibular function, hearing
	- Eyes 
		- Range of eye movements and if bilaterally equal 
		- Peripheral eye movement disorders like cranial neuropathy, eye muscle weakness ***disconjugate***  
		- Pursuit (follow smooth moving target) and saccades (back and forth between 2 targets) if weak imply cerebellar Pathology or central 
		- Alignment by cover test 
		- Vertical misalignment in brainstem or cerebellar lesion
		- Spontaneous Nystagmus - involuntary back and forth movement of eyes 
		- Jerk type most common, slow drift (slow phase) in one direction alternate with rapid saccadic movement (fast phase) in opposite direction 
		- If primary position nystagmus in light, usually central Pathology (except vestibular neuritis)

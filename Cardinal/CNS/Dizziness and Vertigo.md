- Dizziness imprecise symptom including
	- Vertigo 
	- Lightheadedness (classic means presyncopal sensation due to brain hypoperfusion)
	- Faintness

- Vertigo is sense of spinning or other motion that maybe physiological (sustained head rotation) or pathological (vestibular dysfunction)
- Many causes

	- Acute unilateral lesions cause due to imbalance in input
	- Bilateral lesions cause imbalance and instability of vision (***==oscillopsia==***) due to loss of normal vestibular reflexes

	- Vary in duration 
	- May increase in severity till loss of consciousness or may resolve spontaneous
	- Consider in patients with episode of dizziness in upright position

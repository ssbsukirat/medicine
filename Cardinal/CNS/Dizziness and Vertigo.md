- Dizziness imprecise symptom including
	- Vertigo 
	- Lightheadedness (classic means presyncopal sensation due to brain hypoperfusion)
	- Faintness
	- Imbalance
- Vertigo is sense of spinning or other motion that maybe physiological (sustained head rotation) or pathological (vestibular dysfunction)
- Many causes
	- Peripheral disorders that affect Labrinth or vestibular nerves 
	- Central vestibular pathway disruption
	- Paroxysmal 
	- Fixed unilateral or bilateral vestibular deficit 
	- Acute unilateral lesions cause due to imbalance in input
	- Bilateral lesions cause imbalance and instability of vision (***==oscillopsia==***) due to loss of normal vestibular reflexes 
- Presyncopal Dizziness
	- Cardiac dysrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, medication or other cause of brain hypoperfusion
	- Vary in duration 
	- May increase in severity till loss of consciousness or may resolve spontaneous
	- Consider in patients with episode of dizziness in upright position
- Questions
	- Dangerous (dysrhythmias, TIA or stroke)
	- Vestibular? 
	- If vestibular, peripheral or central! 
# Approach
- History 
	- Unilateral or bilateral, acute or chronic
	- Vertigo is illusion of self or environmental motion 
	- Symmetric bilateral vestibular dysfunction causes imbalance but not vertigo 
	- History is unreliable due to imprecise symptom
	- Dizziness
		- Episodes lasting seconds, minutes, hours or days 
		- Seconds 
			- BPPV 
			- Orthostatic hypotension 
			- Both provoked by change in head or body posture 
		- Minutes 
			- Posterior circulation TIAs 
			- Migraine
		- Hours 
			- Vestibular migraine
			- Menieres disease
	- Peripheral vs Central 
		- Unilateral hearing loss and acute aural symptoms (ear pain, pressure, fullness, tinnitus) point to peripheral 
		- Double vision, ataxia, numbness imply central cause 
- Examination
	- Neurological examination important 
	- Assess eye movements, vestibular function, hearing
	- Eyes 
		- Range of eye movements and if bilaterally equal 
		- Peripheral eye movement disorders like cranial neuropathy, eye muscle weakness ***disconjugate***
		- Pursuit (follow smooth moving target) and saccades (back and forth between 2 targets) if weak imply cerebellar Pathology or central 
		- Alignment by cover test 
		- Vertical misalignment in brainstem or cerebellar lesion
		- Spontaneous Nystagmus - involuntary back and forth movement of eyes 
		- Jerk type most common, slow drift (slow phase) in one direction alternate with rapid saccadic movement (fast phase) in opposite direction 
		- If primary position nystagmus in light, usually central Pathology (except vestibular neuritis)
		- Cerebellar characteristic nystagmus
			- Vertical nystagmus with downward fast phase (downbeat)
			- Horizontal nystagmus Changing with gaze (gaze evoked nystagmus)
		- Peripheral lesions cause unidirectional horizontal nystagmus
		- Frenzel eyeglasses (self-illuminated goggles with convex lens to blur patients vision but allow examination with amplification) aid in peripheral vestibular nystagmus detection as they limit ability of fixation to eliminate
	- Head impulse test 
		- Most useful bedside test for peripheral vestibular system
		- Vestibulo-ocular reflex is assessed with small amplitude (20 degree) rapid head rotation
		- If VOR deficient, catch-up saccade in opposite direction of movement 
		- Can identify bilateral or unilateral lesions (catch-up saccade after rotation to weak side) 
	- Dix-Hallpike maneuver 
		- In all patients with episodic dizziness 
		- Sitting with head turned 45 degree
		- Then lowered into supine with head extended to 20 degree while watching eyes -- if ***transient upbeating-torsional nystagmus then Posterior canal BPPV*** 
		- If no nystagmus for 15-20s turn head to opposite side and repeat 
	- Dynamic visual acuity
		- Functional test of vestibular function 
		- Visual acuity tested at rest then when head is rotated back and forth at 1-2hz 
		- If drop is more than one line in near or Snellen then abnormal test 
- Ancillary tests 
	- Audiometry
	- Unilateral hearing loss support peripheral 
	- Predominantly low frequency loss is menieres disease 
	- Videonystamography for spontaneous nystagmus and measuring positional nystagmus
	- Caloric testing to compare 2 horizontal semicircular canals 
	- Video head-impulse testing measures all 6 semicircular canals integrity 
	- Vestibular evoked potentials for otolith reflexes 
	- Neuroimaging if central is suspected
	- If unexplained unilateral hearing loss or vestibular hypofunction, MRI internal auditory canal with gadolinium contrast for schwannoma

# Acute Prolonged Vertigo  
- Acute unilateral vestibular lesion causes vertigo, nausea , vomiting , oscillopsia and imbalance 
- due to sudden asymmetry of input from 2 labyrinths or in central connections 
- Continuous vertigo persists even when head still (unlike BPPV) 
- Central (brainstem infarct or hemorrhage ) vs peripheral  (vestibular nerve or labyrinth)
- Central 
	- diplopia 
	- weakness or numbness 
	- dysarthria 
- Acute peripheral unlikely if head impulse normal 
- Central cannot be excluded by examination alone so rule out stroke in elderly with vascular risk factors 
- Vestibular Neuritis most recover spontaneous , but some chronic dizziness , motion sensitivity and disequilibrium may persist 
- Glucocorticoid therapy +/- 
- Antiviral only in ***Ramsay Hunt Syndrome*** (herpes zoster oticus )
- Vestibular suppresant dont give beyond first few days as may delay central compensation and recovery 
# Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo 
- recurrent vertigo 
- brief episodes (<1 min, typical 15-20s) 
- always provoked by change in head position relative to gravity 
- rolling over in bed to differentiate  BPPV vs orthostatic hypotension 
- free-floating otoconia (calcium carbonate crystals) that have been dislodged from the utricular macula and have moved into one of the semicircular canals
- posterior canal most common 
- otoconia move in canal with change in head position 
- Posterior Canal -- upward and torsional nystagmus (upper pole of eyes towards affected ear), Epley maneuver 
- Horizontal Canal -- horizontal nystagmus when lying with either ear down 
# Vestibular Migraine 
- Common underdiagnosed 
- Vertigo preceding a typical migraine headache but many times no or mild headache 
- frequent migraines in past may present as vertigo later in life 
- duration of vertigo minutes to hours, disequilibrium lasting upto days to weeks in very few 
- Motion sensitivity and sensitivity to visual motion (movies etc) common 
- without headache , features of migraine like photohobia, phonophobia, visual aura 
- treat with migraine prophylactic drugs 
# Menieres Diseases 
- Vertigo and hearing loss with pain, pressure and fullness of affected ear 
- Low-frequency hearing and aural symptoms 
- Audiometry shows asymmetric low-frequency hearing loss at time of attack, hearing improves between attacks 
- Endolymphatic Hydrops with exess endolymph in inner ear 
- Diuretic and sodium restriction initial treatment 
- Glucocorticoid or gentamicin injection in middle ear if persistent disease 
- Nonablative surgical options include decompression and shunting of the endolymphatic sac.
- Full ablative procedures (vestibular nerve section, labyrinthectomy) are seldom required
# Vestibular Schwannoma 
- sometimes termed acoustic neuromas 
- cause slowly progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular hypofunction
- typically do not have vertigo, because the gradual vestibular deficit is compensated centrally as it develops 
- diagnosis when significant hearing loss already present 
- deficient response to the head impulse test when the head is rotated toward the affected side, but nystagmus will not be prominent 
# Bilateral Vestibular Hypofunction 
- typically do not have vertigo, because vestibular function is lost on both sides simultaneously, and there is no asymmetry of vestibular input 
- loss of balance in dark 
- oscillopsia in head movement 
- maybe 
	- idiopathic and progressive 
	- part of neurodegenerative disorders 
	- iatrogenic due to gentamicin or aminoglycosides 
	- bilateral schwannoma (NF2)
	- autoimmune 
	- superficial siderosis 
	- meningeal based infection or tumor 
	- peripheral polyneuropathy (both vestibular loss and propioception contribute to disbalance)
- dimnished dynamic visual acuity 
- abnormal head impulse bilateral 
- romberg 
- caloric testing response reduced 
- avoid suppresant 
# Central Vestibular Disorder 
- vestibular pathway in brainstem and/or cerebellum 
- discrete lesions like stroke or hemorrhage 
- demyelination 
- tumours 
- neurodegenerative conditions 
- Subacute cerebellar degeneration due to immune or paraneoplastic process 
- Emergency due to life threatening stroke possible 
- brain MRI and full NeurologicaL workup 
# Psychosomatic and Functional 
- maybe manifestation of psychiatric disease like MDD, anxiety , panic 
- may have anxiet and autonomic symptoms secondary to independent vestibular disorders 
- Phobic postural Vertigo/ psychophysiological vertigo/ chronic subjective dizziness earlier but now known as Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD)
- Chronic (3 months) feeling of fluctuating dizziness and disequilibrium at rest but worse on standing 
- increased sensitivity to self motion and visual motion 
- past history of neuritis maybe present 
- all otological and vestibular testing normal or compensated vestibular disorder  
- SSRIs , cognitive behavioral therapy and vestibular rehab 
- avoid suppresant

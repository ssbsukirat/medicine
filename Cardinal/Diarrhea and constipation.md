- Neural control
    - intrinsic innervation
        - myenteric
        - Submucosal
        - Mucosal plexus
        - Mediated by NTs
            - VIP
            - Opioid
            - Norepinephrine
            - Serotonin
            - ATP
            - NO 
        - Receives input from extrinsic but capable of independent action
    - Extrinsic
        - part of ANS 
        - Parasympathetic conveys visceral sensory (afferent) and excitatory pathways 
        - Along SMA 
        - Distal colon by sacral parasympathetic (S2-4) via pelvic plexus, as ascending intracolonic fibres maybe upto proximal colon 
        - Excitatory motor control by acetylcholine and tachykinins like substance P 
        - Sympathetic along arterial vessels, excitatory to sphincters and non-excitatory to non-sphincyers

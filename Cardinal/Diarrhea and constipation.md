- Neural control
    - intrinsic innervation
        - myenteric
        - Submucosal
        - Mucosal plexus
        - Mediated by NTs
            - VIP
            - Opioid
            - Norepinephrine
            - Serotonin
            - ATP
            - NO 
        - Receives input from extrinsic but capable of independent action
    - Extrinsic
        - part of ANS 
        - Parasympathetic conveys visceral sensory (afferent) and excitatory pathways 
        - Along SMA 
        - Distal colon by sacral parasympathetic (S2-4) via pelvic plexus, as ascending intracolonic fibres maybe upto proximal colon 
        - Excitatory motor control by acetylcholine and tachykinins like substance P 
        - Sympathetic along arterial vessels, excitatory to sphincters and non-excitatory to non-sphincters 
- Intestinal fluid absorption
    - 9L enters GI tract and 1L residual reaches colon
    - Stool fluid excretion around 0.2L/day
    - Colon has high capacitance may recover upto 4x usual volume (max 0.8L/day)
    - Sodium absorption is electrogenic 
        - can be measured as current
        - No loss of cation
        - By apical membrane
        - Compensated by export function of basolateral sodium pump 
        - Active transport in small bowel coupled to monosaccharides (SGLT1, GLUT-5)
        - Exits via GLUT-2 
- Small intestinal motility
    - cyclical migrating motor complex (MMC)
    - Clears nondigestible residue
    - Lasts 4min and occurs 60-90 mins 
    - Involves entire small bowel
    - After ingestion, small bowel has irregular mixing contraction of low

- Neural control
    - intrinsic innervation
        - myenteric
        - Submucosal
        - Mucosal plexus
        - Mediated by NTs
            - VIP
            - Opioid
            - Norepinephrine
            - Serotonin
            - ATP
            - NO 
        - Receives input from extrinsic but capable of independent action
    - Extrinsic
        - part of ANS 
        - Parasympathetic conveys visceral sensory (afferent) and excitatory pathways 
        - Along SMA 
        - Distal colon by sacral parasympathetic (S2-4) via pelvic plexus, as ascending intracolonic fibres maybe upto proximal colon 
        - Excitatory motor control by acetylcholine and tachykinins like substance P 
        - Sympathetic along arterial vessels, excitatory to sphincters and non-excitatory to non-sphincters 
- Intestinal fluid absorption
    - 9L enters GI tract and 1L residual reaches colon
    - Stool fluid excretion around 0.2L/day
    - Colon has high capacitance may recover upto 4x usual volume (max 0.8L/day)
    - Sodium absorption is electrogenic 
        - can be measured as current
        - No loss of cation
        - By apical membrane
        - Compensated by export function of basolateral sodium pump 
        - Active transport in small bowel coupled to monosaccharides (SGLT1, GLUT-5)
        - Exits via GLUT-2 
- Small intestinal motility
    - cyclical migrating motor complex (MMC)
    - Clears nondigestible residue
    - Lasts 4min and occurs 60-90 mins 
    - Involves entire small bowel
    - After ingestion, ***small bowel has irregular mixing contraction of low amplitude***
    - Distal ileum has ***powerful intermittent contraction*** for ileus emptying by bolus transfers
- Ileocolonic storage and salvage 
    - distal ileum is reservoir emptied intermittently by bolus transfers
    - ***Haustra segments*** the colon and allows mixing, retention and formation of stools 
    - Residets microbiome is mainly ***anaerobic***, necessary for digestion of unabsorbed carbohydrates
    - Microbiome keeps pathogens at bay 
    - Ascending and transverse colon acts as ***reservoir*** (transit time 15h)
    - Descending colon as ***conduit*** (transit 3h)
    - efficient at conserving sodium and water 
- Colonic motility and tone 
    - MMC rarely continues into colon 
    - ***Short duration or phasic contraction*** mix content 
    - High amplitude (>75mmhg) propagated contractions (HAPCs) associated with mass movements
    - HAPCs 5/day usually on awakening and postprandial
    - Increased HAPCs cause diarrhoea or urgency 
    - Colonic tone is background contractility with superimposed phasic activity
- Colonic motility after meals 
    - phasic and tonic increase postprandial for 2h 
    - Initial 10 mins mediated by vagus 
    - Subsequent requires calories (atleast 500) and mediated partly by hormones (gastrin and serotonin)
- Defecation
    - tonic contraction of puborectalis (sling around rectoanal junction) maintains continence 
    - Parasympathetic relaxation causes defecation by straightening rectoanal angle
    - Rectum distension causes transient relaxation of internal anal sphincter (by intrinsic and reflex sympathetic innervation)
    - Increased abdominal pressure opens rectosigmoid angle >15 degree
        - contractions
        - Straining
        - Valsalva maneuver
    - Voluntary relaxation of external sphincter after distension causes defecation

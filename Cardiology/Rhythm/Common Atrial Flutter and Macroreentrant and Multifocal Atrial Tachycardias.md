- **Macroreentrant atrial tachycardia** is due to a large anatomic reentry circuit, often associated with areas of scar in the atria
# Common or typical right atrial flutter 
- is due to a circuit pathway around the tricuspid valve annulus, bounded anteriorly by the annulus and posteriorly by functional conduction block in the crista terminalis -->
- wavefront between IVC, tricuspid annulus (**sub-Eustachian or cavotricuspid isthmus** ) --> aka Cavotricuspid Isthmus-dependent Atrial Flutter --> can be catheter ablated 
- **counterclockwise** direction (as viewed looking toward the tricuspid annulus from the ventricular apex), which produces the characteristic **negative sawtooth flutter waves in leads II, III, and aVF and positive P waves in lead V1**
- atrial rate is typically 240â€“300 beats/min but may be slower in the presence of atrial disease or antiarrhythmic drugs --> conducted at 2:1 AV block --> 130-150/min tachycardia (P overlaps T)
- maneuver to increase AV block --> flutter wave exposed 
- a/w AF and atrial scar 
- Right sided cardiac or Pulmonary vascular disease --> predispose to common right atrial flutter 
- AF treated with flecanide, propafenone , amiodarone --> present as flutter 
# Atypical Atrial Tachycardia 
- Macroreentrant atrial tachycardias (ATs) that are not dependent on conduction through the cavotricuspid isthmus 
- in either atria and associated with scar 
- in RA only when right atriotomy as part of cardiac surgery 
- LA flutter and perimitral LA flutter are commonly seen after extensive left atrial ablation for atrial fibrillation or atrial surgery
- similar to common atrial flutter but with different P- wave morphologies 
- difficult to distinguish from focal AT, and in most cases, the mechanism can only be confirmed by an electrophysiology study 
# MANAGEMENT 
- similar to AF 
- electric cardioversion in hemodynamic instability 
- AV nodal block in stable patient 
- thrombotic risk similar to AF --> 
- Anticoagulation is warranted
	- prior to conversion for episodes >48 h in duration and 
	- chronically for patients at increased risk of thromboembolic stroke based on the CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system
- 1st episode commonly spontaneous revert to sinus 
- recurrent episodes, **antiarrhythmic drug therapy with sotalol, dofetilide, disopyramide, and amiodarone** may be considered, but >70% of patients experience recurrences
- in recurrent --> catheter ablation (maybe considered 1st line)

# Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia 
- 3 distinct P wave morphology 
- rate 100-150/min 
- clear isoelectric interval between P waves + slower atrial rate VS AF 
- likely triggered automaticity from multiple atrial foci 
- mostly seen in COPD and acute illness 
- therapy --> treat the cause, correct metabolic abnormalities 
- Verapamil or diltiazem to slow atrial and ventricular rate 
- severe pulmonary disease often do not tolerate beta blocker therapy. 
- may respond to amiodarone --> but avoid long-term use d/t toxicity like pulmonary fibrosis

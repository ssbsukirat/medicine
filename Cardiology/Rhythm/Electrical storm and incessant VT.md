# Electrical Storm 
- occurrence of three or more episodes of VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) within 24 h requiring intervention for termination. 
- associated with a high mortality and requires prompt therapeutic intervention 
- Catheter ablation is life-saving 
# Incessant VT
- VT continues to recur shortly after electrical, pharmacologic, or spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm 
- typically monomorphic 
- rare --> slow incessant monomorphic VT will fail detection by an ICD because it falls outside of the programmed detection parameters
- may become incessant d/t proarrhytmic action of antiarrhythmic drug -- amiodarone , flecainide 
- urgent catheter ablation 
# MANAGEMENT of patient with ICD shocks 
- can be a sign of impending instability, deterioration of cardiac function, or emergence of a new arrhythmia and therefore requires evaluation 
- interrogation of ICD once patient reports shock or symptoms of arrhythmia --> confirm therapy was given for ventricular arrhythmia 
- occurrence of multiple ICD shocks constitutes a medical emergency and warrants immediate medical attention by activating the emergency medical system'
- should never drive to hospital after receiving shock 
- spontaneous arrhythmia a/w subsequent increased risk of death and hospitalization in patients with depressed ventricular function --> evaluate for worsening cardiac function , emergence of ischemia or intercurrent illness 
- if VT/VF --> consider catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic 
- possibility of a shock can be reduced with appropriate ICD programming.
- ATP --> can reduce 70% shocks 
- patients implanted with ICDs as primary prevention, **programming of VF detection zones >220 beats/min** significantly reduces unnecessary and inappropriate shocks
- beta blockers sotalol and amiodarone are the most common pharmacologic options. 
- Most antiarrhythmic drugs have the potential to induce bradycardia to the point of requiring pacing from the ICD that, in itself, may have deleterious effects on ventricular function
# MANAGEMENT of electrical storm 
- adequate sedation 
- standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines; treatment includes the use of medications such as beta blockers, amiodarone, and lidocaine with correction of any metabolic abnormalities 
- assess whether VT is monomorphic or polymorphic 
- Sedation or general anesthesia should be considered for suppression of recurrent hemodynamically unstable ventricular arrhythmia 
- Percutaneous stellate ganglion block and upper thoracic epidural anesthesia may reduce cardiac sympathetic outflow 
- rarely mechanical ventricular support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, percutaneous left ventricular assist device, or intra- aortic balloon pump may be considered

## VT/VF post MI 
- consider if polymorphic VT/ VF is primary arrhythmia 
- emergent revascularization and alleviation of anginal symptoms should be attempted 
- surviving Purkinje cells can exhibit triggered automaticity and lead to recurrent episodes of polymorphic VT/VF requiring frequent cardioversions before and after revascularization. 
- Catheter ablation of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) that are observed to repeatedly initiate the arrhythmia can be effective
## PVC induced polymorphic VT/VF 
- without myocardial infarction or ischemia can have PVC-initiated polymorphic VT/VF storm 
- caused by triggering PVCs originating from fascicular tissue or papillary muscles.
- Catheter ablation is indicated for this condition when antiarrhythmic medication is ineffective.
## Acquired or Congenital Long QT
- intravenous magnesium should be administered for its immediate effect on repolarization 
- electrolyte repletion, especially potassium, should be aggressively pursued 
- increased HR --> normalised QT --> consider pacing or pharmacologic support 
- Isoproterenol can be used to increase a patient’s sinus rate 
- lidocaine can reduce the QT interval --> avoid others 
## Brugada 
- If the QT interval is not prolonged and a Brugada pattern of Rsr′ with ST elevation in leads V1 or V2 is seen on resting ECG, administration of **quinidine and/or isoproterenol** may abolish recurrent polymorphic VT/VF episodes
- Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and isoproterenol 
- epicardial substrate-based catheter ablation over the right ventricular outflow tract has been described as a strategy for drug-refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias in Brugada syndrome 
## Inflammatory Cardiomyopathy 
- inflammatory myocarditis causing the frequent ventricular arrhythmias 
- Giant cell myocarditis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and certain viral myocarditis can present with VT/VF storm.
- endomyocardial biopsy should be considered to potentially identify new-onset inflammatory cardiomyopathies that may require urgent anti-inflammatory therapy

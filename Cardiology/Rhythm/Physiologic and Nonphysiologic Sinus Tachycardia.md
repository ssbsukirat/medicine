- Sinus node 
	- group of cells in lateral superior aspect of junction of RA and SVC 
	- in the superior aspect of thick ridge of muscle -- crista terminalis 
- sinus tachycardia will present as abnormal awareness of own heartbeat 
- ECG -- 
	- characteristic P wave originating from the superior and lateral aspect of the right atrium with a positive deflection in leads I, II, and III and 
	- a biphasic morphology in lead V1 
	- Sinus P waves are characterized by a frontal plane **axis directed inferiorly and leftward,** with positive P waves in leads II, III, and aVF; a negative P wave in aVR; and an initially positive biphasic P wave in V1. 
	- NSR between 60-100/min 
# Physiological sinus tachycardia 
- sympathetic stimulation and vagal withdrawal 
- rate of spontaneous depolarization increase 
- focus of earliest activation within the node typically shifts more leftward and closer to the superior septal aspect of the crista terminalis, thus producing **taller P waves in the inferior limb leads when compared to normal sinus rhythm** 
- physiological -- when it is in response to exercise , stress , illness 
- vs focal atrial tachycardia 
	- causative factor (e.g., exertion) and a gradual rate increase favor a diagnosis of sinus tachycardia, whereas abrupt tachycardia onset and offset favor atrial tachycardia 
	- may need extended ECG monitoring to differentiate 
- TREATMENT -- treat underlying cause, often no TREATMENT is needed 
- consider abnormal thyroid function or anemia 
- CVS abnormalities presenting as sinus tachycardia 
	- pulmonary embolism 
- relatively elevated sinus rate (whether at rest or during exercise) without underlying cause, particularly without symptoms, typical does not warrant treatment

# Nonphysiologic Sinus Tachycardia 
- Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is an uncommon condition in which the sinus rate increases spontaneously at rest or out of proportion to physiologic stress or exertion and is within a spectrum of ill-defined conditions associated with autonomic dysregulation. 
- d/t imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs to node 
- often women in 3rd/4th decade of life 
- palpitations +/- fatigue , dizziness , syncope 
- additional -- chest pain, headache , GI upset
- vs appropriate sinus tachycardia , focal atrial tachycardia arising near sinus node 
- TREATMENT 
	- ineffective or poorly tolerated 
	- beta blocker or calcium channel blocker 
	- Clonidine 
	- serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
	- Ivabradine 
		- blocks If current 
	- catheter ablation of sinus node to modify sinus rate 
## POTS 
- Postural orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome 
- symptomatic sinus tachycardia on supine --> standing 
- sinus rate increases by 30 beats/min or to >120 beats/min within 10 min of standing and in the absence of hypotension. 
- d/t autonomic dysfunction following viral illness 
- resolves spontaneously over 3-12 months 
- TREATMENT 
	- volume expansion with salt expansion , 
	- oral fludrocortisone
	- compression stockings 
	- midodrine - alpha agonist

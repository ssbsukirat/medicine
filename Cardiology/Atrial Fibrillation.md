# Pathophysiology & Epidemiology 
- Cardiac arrhythmia -- seemingly disorganised, rapid, irregular atrial activation --> loss of organised atrial mechanical contraction 
- conducted ventricular rate --> irregular , rapid ventricular rate b/w 110-160/min in most 
- sometime rate >200/min but in some with Vagal tone or conduction defects --> slow rate 
- prevalence more in age --> 95% of AF have age >60 
- men > women, white> black 
- Risk factor 
	- Age 
	- HTN 
	- DM 
	- Cardiac disease 
	- family h/o AF 
	- obesity 
	- Sleep disordered breathing 
- mortality 1.5-1.9x with higher risk of stroke --> 25% of all strokes 
- increased dementia , MRI-detected asymptomatic embolic infarct 
- PRECIPITATING 
	- hyperthyroidism 
	- acute alcohol intoxication 
	- MI 
	- PTE 
	- Pericarditis 
	- cardiac surgery 
- Pattern 
	- **Paroxysmal** --> spontaneous , terminate in short days, mostly <7 days 
	- **Persistent** --> >7days , <1 year 
	- **Long-standing persistent** --> >1 year 
	- ![[AFcategories.png]]
- proposed pathophysiology suggests a **“final common pathway”** of risk factors leading to electrophysiologic changes in atrial tissues
- progressive disease in most 
- other tissue that produce ectopic and trigger AF 
	- SVC 
	- Coronary Sinus 
	- remnant of vein of marshall 
# Clinical Presentation 
- D/t 
	- irregular , rapid or slow ventricular rates 
	- hemodynamic instability d/t impaired cardiac function 
	- consequences of cardioembolic phenomena 
	- AF impact on CV function over time 
- ECG/ Ambulatory ECG --> lack of organized atrial activity (no P wave), with an irregular ventricular response 
- irregular , rapid ventricular rates --> variable cardiac displacement and contraction --> palpitations , awareness of heart beats 
- in AF --> atrial systole no role in cardiac output --> variable ventricular function --> variable stroke volume --> exercise intolerance, fatigue , weakness, presyncope, dyspnea 
- may precipitate underlying cardiac disease 
	- HOCM 
	- CAD 
	- HFpEF, HFrEF 
	- amyloidosis 
- AF --> sinus --> pause --> presyncope /syncope 
- loss of atrial mechanical function --> blood stasis --> thrombus formation --> embolism --> stroke and others --> recurrent strokes --> debilitating neurological sequelae 
- prolonged periods of FVR --> **tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy** 
	- reversible once rate controlled 
- persistent AF -->.LA>RA dilated , higher fibrotic load 
	- fibrotic left atrium --> elevated left atrial filling pressures, volume overload, and congestive heart failure, have been described as **“stiff left atrial syndrome.”** 
# TREATMENT 
- Aims 
	- Control symptoms with rate +/- rhythm control 
	- mitigate thromboembolism risk 
	- change modifiable risk factor of AF progress 
- Acute AF + hemodynamic compromise/ pulmonary edema/ coronary ischemia --> **Emergent cardioversion** 
	- QRS synchronous shock in sedated patient 
	- Pharmacologic

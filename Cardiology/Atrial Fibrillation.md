# Pathophysiology & Epidemiology 
- Cardiac arrhythmia -- seemingly disorganised, rapid, irregular atrial activation --> loss of organised atrial mechanical contraction 
- conducted ventricular rate --> irregular , rapid ventricular rate b/w 110-160/min in most 
- sometime rate >200/min but in some with Vagal tone or conduction defects --> slow rate 
- prevalence more in age --> 95% of AF have age >60 
- men > women, white> black 
- Risk factor 
	- Age 
	- HTN 
	- DM 
	- Cardiac disease 
	- family h/o AF 
	- obesity 
	- Sleep disordered breathing 
- mortality 1.5-1.9x with higher risk of stroke --> 25% of all strokes 
- increased dementia , MRI-detected asymptomatic embolic infarct 
- PRECIPITATING 
	- hyperthyroidism 
	- acute alcohol intoxication 
	- MI 
	- PTE 
	- Pericarditis 
	- cardiac surgery 
- Pattern 
	- **Paroxysmal** --> spontaneous , terminate in short days, mostly <7 days 
	- **Persistent** --> >7days , <1 year 
	- **Long-standing persistent** --> >1 year

- proposed pathophysiology suggests a **“final common pathway”** of risk factors leading to electrophysiologic changes in atrial tissues
- progressive disease in most

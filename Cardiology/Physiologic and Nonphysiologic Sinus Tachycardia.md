- Sinus node 
	- group of cells in lateral superior aspect of junction of RA and SVC 
	- in the superior aspect of thick ridge of muscle -- crista terminalis 
- sinus tachycardia will present as abnormal awareness of own heartbeat 
- ECG -- 
	- characteristic P wave originating from the superior and lateral aspect of the right atrium with a positive deflection in leads I, II, and III and 
	- a biphasic morphology in lead V1 
	- Sinus P waves are characterized by a frontal plane **axis directed inferiorly and leftward,** with positive P waves in leads II, III, and aVF; a negative P wave in aVR; and an initially positive biphasic P wave in V1. 
	- NSR between 60-100/min 
# Physiological sinus tachycardia 
- sympathetic stimulation and vagal withdrawal

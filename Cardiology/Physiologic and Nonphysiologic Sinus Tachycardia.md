- Sinus node 
	- group of cells in lateral superior aspect of junction of RA and SVC 
	- in the superior aspect of thick ridge of muscle -- crista terminalis 
- sinus tachycardia will present as abnormal awareness of own heartbeat 
- ECG -- 
	- characteristic P wave originating from the superior and lateral aspect of the right atrium with a positive deflection in leads I, II, and III and 
	- a biphasic morphology in lead V1 
	- Sinus P waves are characterized by a frontal plane **axis directed inferiorly and leftward,** with positive P waves in leads II, III, and aVF; a negative P wave in aVR; and an initially positive biphasic P wave in V1. 
	- NSR between 60-100/min 
# Physiological sinus tachycardia 
- sympathetic stimulation and vagal withdrawal 
- rate of spontaneous depolarization increase 
- focus of earliest activation within the node typically shifts more leftward and closer to the superior septal aspect of the crista terminalis, thus producing **taller P waves in the inferior limb leads when compared to normal sinus rhythm** 
- physiological -- when it is in response to exercise , stress , illness 
- vs focal atrial tachycardia 
	- causative factor (e.g., exertion) and a gradual rate increase favor a diagnosis of sinus tachycardia, whereas abrupt tachycardia onset and offset favor atrial tachycardia 
	- may need extended ECG monitoring to differentiate 
- TREATMENT -- treat underlying cause, often no TREATMENT is needed 
- consider abnormal thyroid function or anemia 
- CVS abnormalities presenting as sinus tachycardia

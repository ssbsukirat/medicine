# Electrical Storm 
- occurrence of three or more episodes of VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) within 24 h requiring intervention for termination. 
- associated with a high mortality and requires prompt therapeutic intervention 
- Catheter ablation is life-saving 
# Incessant VT
- VT continues to recur shortly after electrical, pharmacologic, or spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm 
- typically monomorphic 
- rare --> slow incessant monomorphic VT will fail detection by an ICD because it falls outside of the programmed detection parameters
- may become incessant d/t proarrhytmic action of antiarrhythmic drug -- amiodarone , flecainide 
- urgent catheter ablation 
# MANAGEMENT of patient with ICD shocks 
- can be a sign of impending instability, deterioration of cardiac function, or emergence of a new arrhythmia and therefore requires evaluation 
- interrogation of ICD once patient reports shock or symptoms of arrhythmia --> confirm therapy was given for ventricular arrhythmia 
- occurrence of multiple ICD shocks constitutes a medical emergency and warrants immediate medical attention by activating the emergency medical system'
- should never drive to hospital after receiving shock 
- spontaneous arrhythmia a/w subsequent increased risk of death and hospitalization in patients with depressed ventricular function --> evaluate for worsening cardiac function , emergence of ischemia or intercurrent illness 
- if VT/VF --> consider catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic 
- possibility of a shock can be reduced with appropriate ICD programming.
- ATP --> can reduce 70% shocks 
- patients implanted with ICDs as primary prevention, **programming of VF detection zones >220 beats/min** significantly reduces unnecessary and inappropriate shocks
- beta blockers sotalol and amiodarone are the most common pharmacologic options. 
- Most antiarrhythmic drugs have the potential to induce bradycardia to the point of requiring pacing from the ICD that, in itself, may have deleterious effects on ventricular function
# MANAGEMENT of electrical storm 
- adequate sedation 
- standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines; treatment includes the use of medications such as beta blockers, amiodarone, and lidocaine with correction of any metabolic abnormalities 
- assess whether VT is monomorphic or polymorphic 
- Sedation or general anesthesia should be considered for suppression of recurrent hemodynamically unstable ventricular arrhythmia 
- Percutaneous stellate ganglion block and upper thoracic epidural anesthesia may reduce cardiac sympathetic outflow 
- rarely mechanical ventricular support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, percutaneous left ventricular assist device, or intra- aortic balloon pump may be considered

# VT/VF post MI 
- consider if polymorphic VT/ VF is primary arrhythmia

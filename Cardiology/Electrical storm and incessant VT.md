# Electrical Storm 
- occurrence of three or more episodes of VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) within 24 h requiring intervention for termination. 
- associated with a high mortality and requires prompt therapeutic intervention 
- Catheter ablation is life-saving 
# Incessant VT
- VT continues to recur shortly after electrical, pharmacologic, or spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm 
- typically monomorphic 
- rare --> slow incessant monomorphic VT will fail detection by an ICD because it falls outside of the programmed detection parameters
- may become incessant d/t

# Electrical Storm 
- occurrence of three or more episodes of VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) within 24 h requiring intervention for termination. 
- associated with a high mortality and requires prompt therapeutic intervention 
- Catheter ablation is life-saving 
# Incessant VT
- VT continues to recur shortly after electrical, pharmacologic, or spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm 
- typically monomorphic 
- rare --> slow incessant monomorphic VT will fail detection by an ICD because it falls outside of the programmed detection parameters
- may become incessant d/t proarrhytmic action of antiarrhythmic drug -- amiodarone , flecainide 
- urgent catheter ablation 
# MANAGEMENT of patient with ICD shocks 
- can be a sign of impending instability, deterioration of cardiac function, or emergence of a new arrhythmia and therefore requires evaluation 
- interrogation of ICD once patient reports shock or symptoms of arrhythmia --> confirm therapy was given for ventricular arrhythmia 
- occurrence of multiple ICD shocks constitutes a medical emergency and warrants immediate medical attention by activating the emergency medical system'
- should never drive to hospital after receiving shock 
- spontaneous arrhythmia a/w subsequent increased risk of death and hospitalization in patients with depressed ventricular function --> evaluate for worsening cardiac function , emergence of ischemia or intercurrent illness

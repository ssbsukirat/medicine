- mostly asymptomatic and does not require specific treatment 
# Premature Ventricular Contraction and Nonsustained VT 
- very common 
- due to enhanced automaticity, triggered automaticity, or reentry 
- sensitive to sympathetic stimulation and can be a sign of increased sympathetic tone, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, or underlying heart disease 
- can be a harbinger of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in MI or structural heart disease 
- ECG 
	- PVCs with **smooth uninterrupted contours and sharp QRS deflections** may suggest an ectopic focus in relatively **normal** myocardium, 
	- whereas **broad notching and slurred QRS deflections may suggest a diseased myocardial substrate.**
	- morphology of QRS suggests site 
	- dominant S wave in V1, referred to as a **left bundle branch block–like configuration, originate from the right ventricle or interventricular septum.**
	- dominant R wave in V1 originate from the left ventricle.
	- superior frontal plane axis (negative in II, III, aVF) indicates initial depolarization of the inferior wall (diaphragmatic aspect of the heart), whereas an inferior frontal plane axis (positive in II, III, aVF) indicates an origin in the cranial aspect of the heart 
- if not associated with structural cardiac disease then have mostly LBBB configuration 
- RBBB configuration likely to have cardiac disease 
- Multiple morphologies of PVCs (multifocal PVCs) are also more likely to indicate structural heart disease or a myopathic disease process
# PVCs AND NSVT DURING ACUTE ILLNESS 
- acute illness or as a new finding, evaluation should focus on detection and correction of potential aggravating factors and causes, specifically myocardial ischemia, ventricular dysfunction, and electrolyte abnormalities, most commonly **hypokalemia** 
- asymptomatic PVCs and NSVT in the hospitalized patient do not indicate any specific treatment outside the patient’s presenting illness.
# PVCs AND NSVT IN PATIENTS WITHOUT HEART DISEASE 
- originate from the left or right ventricular outflow tracts near the valve annuli, giving rise to PVCs or VT that have a left bundle branch block–like configuration, with an inferiorly directed frontal plane axis,
- other regions --> papillary muscles and fascicular tissue
- benign idiopathic NSVT --> monomorphic , <200/min 
- rapid, polymorphic first beay prior to peak of T --> Short coupled --> evaluation for underlying disease 
- if f/h/o SCD --> evaluation for cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) 
- MVP, Mitral annular disjunction --> a/w papillary muscle PVCs & SCD 
- 2DECHO for ventricular function, wall motion abnormalities, and valvular heart diseas 

# TREATMENT of Idiopathic Arrhythmia 
- no specific therapy is needed unless the patient has significant symptoms or evidence that frequent PVCs are depressing ventricular function 
- Reassurance 
- Avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine and alcohol, is helpful 
- If symptoms require treatment, β-adrenergic blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) 
- flecainide, propafenone, mexiletine, and amiodarone can be effective 
- Catheter Ablation 
# PVCs AND NSVT ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES 
- common and can be an early manifestation of ischemia and a harbinger of subsequent VF 
- Treatment with β-adrenergic blockers and correction of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia reduce the risk of VF 
- routine lidocaine , amiodarone no role for suppressing PVCs or asymptomatic NSVT 
- post MI --> frequent PVCs (typically >10 PVCs/h), repetitive PVCs with couplets, and NSVT are markers for depressed ventricular function and increased mortality 
- post MI --> amiodarone , beta blocker, ICDs can be used 
- ICDs in 
	- survived >40days post MI 
	- LV EF <30% 
	- EF<35% + heart failure 
	- >5 days after MI who have a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, NSVT, and inducible sustained VT or VF on electrophysiologic testing 
# PVCs AND NSVT ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSED VENTRICULAR FUNCTION AND HEART FAILURE 
- common in patients with depressed ventricular function and heart failure and are markers for disease severity and increased mortality 
- avoid sodium channel blockage drugs (flecainide, propafenone, mexiletine, quinidine, and disopyramide) as risk of proarrhytmic and negative inotropic 
- Amiodarone suppresses ventricular ectopy and reduces sudden death but does not improve overall survival 
- ICDs --> left ventricular ejection fraction <35% and New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure 
# PVC & NSVT Associated with other cardiac diseases 
- increases mortality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or with congenital heart disease associated with right or left ventricular dysfunction. 
- ICDs for SCD prevention 
# PVC induced Ventricular Dysfunction

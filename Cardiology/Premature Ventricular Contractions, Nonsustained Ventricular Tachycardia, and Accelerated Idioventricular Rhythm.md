- mostly asymptomatic and does not require specific treatment 
# Premature Ventricular Contraction and Nonsustained VT 
- very common 
- due to enhanced automaticity, triggered automaticity, or reentry 
- sensitive to sympathetic stimulation and can be a sign of increased sympathetic tone, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, or underlying heart disease 
- can be a harbinger of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in MI or structural heart disease 
- ECG 
	- PVCs with **smooth uninterrupted contours and sharp QRS deflections** may suggest an ectopic focus in relatively **normal** myocardium, 
	- whereas **broad notching and slurred QRS deflections may suggest a diseased myocardial substrate.**
	- morphology of QRS suggests site 
	- dominant S wave in V1, referred to as a **left bundle branch blockâ€“like configuration, originate from the right ventricle or interventricular septum.**
	- dominant R wave in V1 originate from the left ventricle.

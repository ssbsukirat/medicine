- mostly asymptomatic and does not require specific treatment 
# Premature Ventricular Contraction and Nonsustained VT 
- very common 
- due to enhanced automaticity, triggered automaticity, or reentry 
- sensitive to sympathetic stimulation and can be a sign of increased sympathetic tone, myocardial ischemia, hypoxia, electrolyte abnormalities, or underlying heart disease 
- can be a harbinger of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in MI or structural heart disease 
- ECG 
	- PVCs with **smooth uninterrupted contours and sharp QRS deflections** may suggest an ectopic focus in relatively **normal** myocardium, 
	- whereas **broad notching and slurred QRS deflections may suggest a diseased myocardial substrate.**
	- morphology of QRS suggests site 
	- dominant S wave in V1, referred to as a **left bundle branch blockâ€“like configuration, originate from the right ventricle or interventricular septum.**
	- dominant R wave in V1 originate from the left ventricle.
	- superior frontal plane axis (negative in II, III, aVF) indicates initial depolarization of the inferior wall (diaphragmatic aspect of the heart), whereas an inferior frontal plane axis (positive in II, III, aVF) indicates an origin in the cranial aspect of the heart 
- if not associated with structural cardiac disease then have mostly LBBB configuration 
- RBBB configuration likely to have cardiac disease 
- Multiple morphologies of PVCs (multifocal PVCs) are also more likely to indicate structural heart disease or a myopathic disease process

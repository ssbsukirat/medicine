- Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a ventricular arrhythmia with a wide QRS lasting for 30 s or requiring an intervention for termination
- all QRS same morphology --> s/o automaticity or reentry circuit 
- most often an area of patchy replacement fibrosis due to infarction, fibrosis, inflammation, or prior cardiac surgery that creates anatomic or functional reentry pathways 
- **scar-related reentrant VTs are associated with risk of sudden death**, idiopathic VT is a more benign form of VT that occurs in structurally normal hearts
- Rapid VT can produce hypotension that may present as syncope, particularly in patients with significant ventricular dysfunction 
- Monomorphic VT that is rapid or associated with structural heart disease may eventually deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation (VF) 
# Diagnosis 
- sustained monomorphic VT --> distinguish from other uniform wide QRS tachycardia 
	- SVT with LBBB/ RBBB aberrancy 
	- SVT with accessory pathway 
	- rapid cardiac pacing 
- if heart disease ++ --> likely to be VT independent of QRS morphology 
- if LV dysfunction / myocardial defect --> reentry is likely cause 
- Scar 
	- pathologic Q waves 
	- segmental LV/RV wall motion abnormal 
	- delayed gadolinium contrast uptake on MRI 
- table from harrison 
- hemodynamic stability does not differentiate 
- ECG for SVT with aberrancy vs VT 
	- Ventriculoatrial dissociation --> especially if atrial rate slower than ventricular 
	- P after every QRS does not exclude VT as 1:1 conduction may exist 
	- **monophasic R wave or Rs complex in aVR** or **concordance from V1 to V6 of monophasic R or S waves** is also relatively specific for VT 
- if k/c/o BBB --> same QRS as during sinus --> s/o SVT 
	- reentry involving the bundle branches of the Purkinje system can have a VT morphology that resembles their native QRS in sinus rhythm

# Treatment 
- follow ACLS guidelines 
- QRS synchronous electrical cardioversion if 
	- hypotension 
	- impaired consciousness 
	- pulmonary edema 
- if stable --> adenosine trial to differentiate SVT with abberancy 
	- no adenosine if heart transplant , irregular / unstable wide complex rhythm 
- post reverting to sinus --> hospitalise to evaluate 
- markers for MI to be done (MI is rarely cause of sustained monomorphic VT)
- Subsequent management is determined by the underlying heart disease and frequency of VT 
- If frequent recurrent VT --> antiarrhythmic or catheter ablation 
- Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are warranted for secondary prevention of sudden death in patients who present with sustained VT associated with structural heart disease 
# SUSTAINED MONOMORPHIC VT IN SPECIFIC DISEASES 
## CAD 
- typically have a history of a remote prior large MI 
- years after acute infarction --> remodeled LV and severely depressed LV function 
- even in acute MI --> suspect old MI scar as cause of VT 
- coronary revascularization is unlikely to prevent recurrent VT --> more appropriate for treatment of angina or other indications 
- If survival expected >1y --> ICD implant 
- Antiarrhythmic drugs may have some utility for palliation of VT symptoms and prevention of ICD therapies, such as shocks and antitachycardia pacing; however, without an ICD, these drugs do not improve survival 
- post ICD --> treat CAD, HF medically also 
- recurrent VT episodes in patients with an ICD warrant treatment with medications or catheter ablation 
- catheter ablation superior to increasing doses of antiarrhythmics especially amiodarone according to VANISH trial 
## Non-ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy 
- usually d/t scar related reentry 
- scar possibly d/t progressive replacement fibrosis 
- post-viral, genetic and inflammatory etiologies

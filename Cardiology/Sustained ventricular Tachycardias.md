- Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a ventricular arrhythmia with a wide QRS lasting for 30 s or requiring an intervention for termination
- all QRS same morphology --> s/o automaticity or reentry circuit 
- most often an area of patchy replacement fibrosis due to infarction, fibrosis, inflammation, or prior cardiac surgery that creates anatomic or functional reentry pathways 
- **scar-related reentrant VTs are associated with risk of sudden death**, idiopathic VT is a more benign form of VT that occurs in structurally normal hearts
- Rapid VT can produce hypotension that may present as syncope, particularly in patients with significant ventricular dysfunction 
- Monomorphic VT that is rapid or associated with structural heart disease may eventually deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation (VF) 
# Diagnosis 
- sustained monomorphic VT --> distinguish from other uniform wide QRS tachycardia 
	- SVT with LBBB/ RBBB aberrancy 
	- SVT with accessory pathway 
	- rapid cardiac pacing 
- if heart disease ++ --> likely to be VT independent of QRS morphology 
- if LV dysfunction / myocardial defect --> reentry is likely cause 
- Scar 
	- pathologic Q waves 
	- segmental LV/RV wall motion abnormal 
	- delayed gadolinium contrast uptake on MRI 
- table from harrison 
- hemodynamic stability does not differentiate 
- ECG for SVT with aberrancy vs VT 
	- Ventriculoatrial dissociation --> especially if atrial rate slower than ventricular 
	- P after every QRS does not exclude VT as 1:1 conduction may exist 
	- **monophasic R wave or Rs complex in aVR** or **concordance from V1 to V6 of monophasic R or S waves** is also relatively specific for VT

- Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a ventricular arrhythmia with a wide QRS lasting for 30 s or requiring an intervention for termination
- all QRS same morphology --> s/o automaticity or reentry circuit 
- most often an area of patchy replacement fibrosis due to infarction, fibrosis, inflammation, or prior cardiac surgery that creates anatomic or functional reentry pathways 
- **scar-related reentrant VTs are associated with risk of sudden death**, idiopathic VT is a more benign form of VT that occurs in structurally normal hearts
- Rapid VT can produce hypotension that may present as syncope, particularly in patients with significant ventricular dysfunction 
- Monomorphic VT that is rapid or associated with structural heart disease may eventually deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation (VF)

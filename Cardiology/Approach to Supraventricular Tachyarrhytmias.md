- mc form of arrhythmia 
- SVTs -- originate from or are dependent on conduction through the atrium or atrioventricular (AV) node to the ventricles 
- mostly narrow QRS <120ms with with sinus rhythm morphology 
- if LBBB/RBBB or accessory conduction pathway -->may have broad complex tachycardia --> differentiate from Ventricular Tachycardia 
- Episodes that occur with sudden onset and termination are referred to as paroxysmal 
- Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) refers to a family of tachycardias including AV node reentry, AV reciprocating tachycardia using an accessory pathway, and atrial tachycardia

- mc form of arrhythmia 
- SVTs -- originate from or are dependent on conduction through the atrium or atrioventricular (AV) node to the ventricles 
- mostly narrow QRS <120ms with with sinus rhythm morphology 
- if LBBB/RBBB or accessory conduction pathway -->may have broad complex tachycardia --> differentiate from Ventricular Tachycardia 
- Episodes that occur with sudden onset and termination are referred to as paroxysmal 
- Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) refers to a family of tachycardias including AV node reentry, AV reciprocating tachycardia using an accessory pathway, and atrial tachycardia

# Clinical 
- palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, diminished exertional capacity, and occasionally syncope 
- Rarely, a supraventricular arrhythmia precipitates cardiac arrest in patients with Wolff- Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome or severe heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
## Initial Evaluation 
- Ventricular preexcitation on the resting ECG suggests AV reciprocating tachycardia using an accessory pathway 
- urgent care or inpatient setting, **treatment of SVT will often involve vagal maneuvers or carotid sinus massage (CSM)** to ***achieve AV block***

- transient arrhythmia --> ambulatory ECG using wearable devices 
- exercise testing 
	- exercise-related symptoms and potentially evoking the arrhythmia 
- invasive electrophysiology study 
	- occasionally 
	- warranted to provoke the arrhythmia with pacing, confirm the mechanism, and risk stratify the patient, 
	- mostly performed at the time of intended catheter ablation to treat the arrhythmia.
- paroxysmal SVT usually has no underlying structural heart disease 
- mc SVT -- sinus tachycardia 
	- in response to physiological stress like exercise 
	- maybe manifestation of acute illness 
	- treat inciting cause 
- arrhythmia needing immediate TREATMENT 
	- hypotension 
	- impaired consciousness 
	- angina 
	- heart failure

- 10% of PSVTs
- mechanism
	- abnormal automaticity, triggered automaticity or small reentry circuit in diseased atrial tissue 
- focal to differentiate from typical /atypical flutter 
- can originate from most regions of the atria, including atrial tissue extending into a pulmonary vein, the coronary sinus, or vena cava 
- sustained, non-sustained, paroxysmal or incessant 
- non-sustained FAT is mc seen in ambulatory ECG incidence increased with age 
- asymptomatic non-sustained FAT on ECG monitor --> does not need TREATMENT 
- frequent atrial ectopy and nonsustained AT are often precursors to more significant arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter 
- can occur in the absence of structural heart disease or may be associated with any condition that causes atrial fibrosis, including prior catheter ablation 
- maybe sign of underlying illness 
- AT with AV block in digitalis toxicity 
- incessant AT can cause tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy 
- 1:1 AV conduction mostly , sometimes AV block in Wenckebach or fixed pattern (2:1, 3:1) 
- does not terminate with AV block, atrial rate unaffected --> contrast vs AVNRT and AV reentry using accessory pathway 
- **warm-up phase** when the atrial activation rate increases after initiation or a **cool-down phase** when the rate slows prior to termination also favors AT rather than AV nodalâ€“dependent SVT, as this is a common observation with triggered automaticity
- in 1:1 conduction --> similar to sinus tachycardia but PR shorter than RP

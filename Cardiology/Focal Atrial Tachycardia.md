- 10% of PSVTs
- mechanism
	- abnormal automaticity, triggered automaticity or small reentry circuit in diseased atrial tissue 
- focal to differentiate from typical /atypical flutter 
- can originate from most regions of the atria, including atrial tissue extending into a pulmonary vein, the coronary sinus, or vena cava 
- sustained, non-sustained, paroxysmal or incessant 
- non-sustained FAT is mc seen in ambulatory ECG incidence increased with age 
- asymptomatic non-sustained FAT on ECG monitor --> does not need TREATMENT 
- frequent atrial ectopy and nonsustained AT are often precursors to more significant arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter

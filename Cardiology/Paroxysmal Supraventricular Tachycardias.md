# AVNRT - ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRY TACHYCARDIA
- mc form of PSVT > 60% cases 
- mc in 2nd-4th decade in women 
- well tolerated but in elderly if rapid onset --> angina , pulmonary edema, hypotension , syncope 
- mechanism 
	- reentry involving the AV node and the perinodal atrium, 
	- made possible by the existence of multiple pathways for conduction from the atrium into the AV node that are capable of conduction in two directions
	- utilize a slowly conducting AV nodal pathway (**right inferior extension**) that extends from the compact AV node near the His bundle, inferiorly along the tricuspid valve annulus to the floor of the coronary sinus.
	- propagates up this slowly conducting pathway to the compact AV node and then exits from the fast pathway at the top of the AV node 
	- unusual forms use left atrial septum pathway 
	- conduction time from the compact AV node region to the atrium is similar to that from the compact node to the His bundle and ventricles --> atrial activation same time as ventricle 
- P wave is 
	- therefore inscribed during, slightly before, or slightly after the QRS and can be difficult to discern
	- seen at the end of the QRS complex as a pseudo-râ€² in lead V1 and pseudo-S waves in leads II, III, and aVF
	- unusual forms of AVNRT have P waves falling later, anywhere between QRS complexes, in which case, an inverted P wave is seen in the inferior limb leads with the inverted P wave seen in the subsequent T wave.

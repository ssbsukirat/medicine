# AVNRT - ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRY TACHYCARDIA
- mc form of PSVT > 60% cases 
- mc in 2nd-4th decade in women 
- well tolerated but in elderly if rapid onset --> angina , pulmonary edema, hypotension , syncope 
- mechanism 
	- reentry involving the AV node and the perinodal atrium, 
	- made possible by the existence of multiple pathways for conduction from the atrium into the AV node that are capable of conduction in two directions
	- utilize a slowly conducting AV nodal pathway (**right inferior extension**) that extends from the compact AV node near the His bundle, inferiorly along the tricuspid valve annulus to the floor of the coronary sinus.
	- propagates up this slowly conducting pathway to the compact AV node and then exits from the fast pathway at the top of the AV node 
	- unusual forms use left atrial septum pathway 
	- conduction time from the compact AV node region to the atrium is similar to that from the compact node to the His bundle and ventricles --> atrial activation same time as ventricle 
- P wave is 
	- therefore inscribed during, slightly before, or slightly after the QRS and can be difficult to discern
	- seen at the end of the QRS complex as a pseudo-r′ in lead V1 and pseudo-S waves in leads II, III, and aVF
	- unusual forms of AVNRT have P waves falling later, anywhere between QRS complexes, in which case, an inverted P wave is seen in the inferior limb leads with the inverted P wave seen in the subsequent T wave.
- rate varies with sympathetic tone 
- Atrial + ventricle --> spontaneous contraction --> atria contraction against closed tricuspid --> **cannon A wave in JVP** --> natriuretic peptide release --> **posttachycardia diuresis** 
- maneuver or drug to induce AV block --> terminate attack 
- Reassurance and instruction as to how to perform the Valsalva maneuver or other vagal nerve stimulating maneuvers to terminate episodes are sufficient for many patients
- oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem at the onset of an episode can be used to facilitate termination 
- chronic therapy with beta blocker, verapamil , diltiazem or flecainide 
- Catheter ablation 
# Junctional TACHYCARDIA 
- automaticity in AV node 
- more frequently encountered as an incessant tachycardia in children, often in the perioperative period of surgery for congenital heart disease 
- narrow QRS tachycardia, often with ventriculoatrial (VA) block, such that AV dissociation is present
- maybe manifestation of **increased adrenergic tone** and may be seen after administration of **isoproterenol,** particularly after catheter ablation in the perinodal region.
- short period of time after ablation for AVNRT 
- accelerated junctional rhythm --> junctional automatic rhythm  between 50-100/min 
- VA conduction is usually present, with P-wave morphology and timing such that it resembles AVNRT at a slow rate 
# Accessory Pathway & WPW syndrome 
- APs are abnormal connections that allow conduction between the atrium and ventricles across the AV ring
- Accessory Pathway (APs) may cause narrow-complex PSVT, wide-complex tachycardias, and, rarely, sudden death
- associated with Ebstein’s anomaly of the tricuspid valve and forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy including PRKAG2 mutations, Danon’s disease, and Fabry’s disease 
- APs --> across either an AV valve annulus or the septum, most frequently between the left atrium and free wall of the left ventricle > posteroseptal > right free wall, > anteroseptal locations
- if sinus --> AP faster than to his-purkinje --> ventricles pre-excited --> short PR (<0.12s), **slurred initial portion of QRS (delta wave)**, prolonged QRS
- Right sided AP --> pre-excited RV --> LBBB like in V1 and marked pre-excitation 
- Left-sided AP --> RBBB in V1 , negative delta wave in aVL (may mimic Q wave of lateral wall infarct ), minimal or absent pre-excitation (as more distance between SA and left ventricle )

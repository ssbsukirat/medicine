# AVNRT - ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRY TACHYCARDIA
- mc form of PSVT > 60% cases 
- mc in 2nd-4th decade in women 
- well tolerated but in elderly if rapid onset --> angina , pulmonary edema, hypotension , syncope 
- mechanism 
	- reentry involving the AV node and the perinodal atrium, 
	- made possible by the existence of multiple pathways for conduction from the atrium into the AV node that are capable of conduction in two directions
	- utilize a slowly conducting AV nodal pathway (**right inferior extension**) that extends from the compact AV node near the His bundle, inferiorly along the tricuspid valve annulus to the floor of the coronary sinus.
	- propagates up this slowly conducting pathway to the compact AV node and then exits from the fast pathway at the top of the AV node 
	- unusual forms use left atrial septum pathway 
	- conduction time from the compact AV node region to the atrium is similar to that from the compact node to the His bundle and ventricles --> atrial activation same time as ventricle 
- P wave is 
	- therefore inscribed during, slightly before, or slightly after the QRS and can be difficult to discern
	- seen at the end of the QRS complex as a pseudo-r′ in lead V1 and pseudo-S waves in leads II, III, and aVF
	- unusual forms of AVNRT have P waves falling later, anywhere between QRS complexes, in which case, an inverted P wave is seen in the inferior limb leads with the inverted P wave seen in the subsequent T wave.
- rate varies with sympathetic tone 
- Atrial + ventricle --> spontaneous contraction --> atria contraction against closed tricuspid --> **cannon A wave in JVP** --> natriuretic peptide release --> **posttachycardia diuresis** 
- maneuver or drug to induce AV block --> terminate attack 
- Reassurance and instruction as to how to perform the Valsalva maneuver or other vagal nerve stimulating maneuvers to terminate episodes are sufficient for many patients
- oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem at the onset of an episode can be used to facilitate termination 
- chronic therapy with beta blocker, verapamil , diltiazem or flecainide 
- Catheter ablation 
# Junctional TACHYCARDIA 
- automaticity in AV node 
- more frequently encountered as an incessant tachycardia in children, often in the perioperative period of surgery for congenital heart disease 
- narrow QRS tachycardia, often with ventriculoatrial (VA) block, such that AV dissociation is present
- maybe manifestation of **increased adrenergic tone** and may be seen after administration of **isoproterenol,** particularly after catheter ablation in the perinodal region.
- short period of time after ablation for AVNRT 
- accelerated junctional rhythm --> junctional automatic rhythm  between 50-100/min 
- VA conduction is usually present, with P-wave morphology and timing such that it resembles AVNRT at a slow rate 
# Accessory Pathway & WPW syndrome 
- APs are abnormal connections that allow conduction between the atrium and ventricles across the AV ring
- Accessory Pathway (APs) may cause narrow-complex PSVT, wide-complex tachycardias, and, rarely, sudden death
- associated with Ebstein’s anomaly of the tricuspid valve and forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy including PRKAG2 mutations, Danon’s disease, and Fabry’s disease 
- APs --> across either an AV valve annulus or the septum, most frequently between the left atrium and free wall of the left ventricle > posteroseptal > right free wall, > anteroseptal locations
- if sinus --> AP faster than to his-purkinje --> ventricles pre-excited --> short PR (<0.12s), **slurred initial portion of QRS (delta wave)**, prolonged QRS
- Right sided AP --> pre-excited RV --> LBBB like in V1 and marked pre-excitation 
- Left-sided AP --> RBBB in V1 , negative delta wave in aVL (may mimic Q wave of lateral wall infarct ), minimal or absent pre-excitation (as more distance between SA and left ventricle )
- AP at the diaphragmatic surface of the heart, typically in the paraseptal region, produces delta waves that are negative in leads III and aVF, mimicking the Q waves of inferior wall infarction
- WPW syndrome 
	- Wolff-Parkinson-White 
	- pre-excited QRS during sinus and episodes of PSVT 
	- Concealed APs allow only retrograde conduction, from ventricle to atrium, so no preexcitation is present during sinus rhythm, but SVT can occur 
	- Fasciculoventricular connections between the His bundle and ventricular septum produce preexcitation but do not cause arrhythmia, probably because the circuit is too short to promote reentry 
# ATRIOVENTRICULAR Reciprocating TACHYCARDIA 
- mc TACHYCARDIA caused by AP is **orthrodromic AV reciprocating tachycardia** 
- propagates from the atrium anterogradely over the AV node and His-Purkinje system to the ventricles and then reenters the atria via retrograde conduction over the AP 
- narrow QRS +/- LBBB/RBBB but no preexcitation during tachycardia 
- AV or VA block --> terminates 
- RP shorter than PR --> may resemble AVNRT --> but always P f/b QRS 
- Occasionally, an AP conducts extremely slowly in the retrograde direction, resulting in tachycardia with a long R-P interval, similar to most ATs
- slow AP --> reentry --> incessant tachycardia --> **Permanent Junctional Reciprocating Tachycardia** 
# Pre-excited Tachycardia 
- ventricle activated by anterograde conduction over AP 
- mc is **antidromic AV reciprocating tachycardia**  
- atrium to ventricle via the AP and then conducts retrogradely to the atria via the His-Purkinje system and the AV node (or rarely a second AP) 
- wide QRS complex is produced entirely via ventricular excitation over the AP because there is no contribution of ventricular activation over more rapidly conducting specialized His-Purkinje fibers
- indistinguishable from monomorphic VT 
- presence of preexcitation in sinus rhythm suggests the diagnosis 
- also occurs if an AP allows antegrade conduction to the ventricles during AT, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation (AF), or AV nodal reentry, otherwise known as **bystander AP conduction.** 
- RR intervals <250ms during AF in 25% of APs --> risk of sudden death 
- Pre-excited AF --> wide QRS, very irregular rhythm , QRS may change on beat to beat basis 
- AV nodal–blocking agents, including **oral or intravenous verapamil, diltiazem, beta blockers, intravenous adenosine, and intravenous amiodarone, is contraindicated during preexcited AF**
- treated with **electrical cardioversion or intravenous procainamide or ibutilide,** which may terminate the arrhythmia or slow the ventricular rate
# MANAGEMENT 
- rhythm determine 
- rule out Ebsteins anomaly and HOCM 
- invasibve electrophysiology study + catheter ablation 
- Catheter ablation is warranted for recurrent arrhythmias when drugs are ineffective, not tolerated, or not desired by the patient. 
	- Complications 
		- Av block 
		- cardiac tamponade 
		- thromboembolism 
		- coronary artery injury 
		- vascular access complication 
- concealed APs or known low-risk APs causing orthodromic AVRT, chronic therapy is guided by symptoms and frequency of events. Vagal maneuvers may terminate episodes, as may a dose of beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem taken at the onset of an episode.
# TREATMENT 
- narrow QRS PSVT depends on presentation 
- **hypotension with unconsciousness or respiratory distress, QRS- synchronous direct current cardioversion is warranted**
- stable --> IV adenosine 
- PSVT dependent on AV nodal conduction --> respond to vagotonic or sympatholytic maneuvers 
- ![[PSVTtreatmnent.png]]
- Carotid sinus massage, Valsalva --> if ineffective Adenosine 
- Adenosine 
	- transient chest pain, dyspnea, anxiety 
	- c/i in prior cardiac transplant 
	- may aggravate bronchospasm 
	- may precipitate AF --> careful use in WPW as AF may cause hemodynamic compromise

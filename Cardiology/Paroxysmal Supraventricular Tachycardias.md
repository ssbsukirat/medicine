# AVNRT - ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRY TACHYCARDIA
- mc form of PSVT > 60% cases 
- mc in 2nd-4th decade in women 
- well tolerated but in elderly if rapid onset --> angina , pulmonary edema, hypotension , syncope 
- mechanism 
	- reentry involving the AV node and the perinodal atrium, 
	- made possible by the existence of multiple pathways for conduction from the atrium into the AV node that are capable of conduction in two directions
	- utilize a slowly conducting AV nodal pathway (**right inferior extension**) that extends from the compact AV node near the His bundle, inferiorly along the tricuspid valve annulus to the floor of the coronary sinus.
	- propagates up this slowly conducting pathway to the compact AV node and then exits from the fast pathway at the top of the AV node 
	- unusual

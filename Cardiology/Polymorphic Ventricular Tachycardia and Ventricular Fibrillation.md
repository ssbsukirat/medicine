# Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia 
- continuously changing QRS from beat to beat --> continuously changing ventricular activation sequence 
- polymorphic VT does not necessarily indicate a fixed structural abnormality or focus of automaticity 
- Reentry can occur with continually changing reentrant paths, spiral wave reentry, and multiple automatic foci as potential mechanisms 
- sustained polymorphic VT --> VFib 
# Polymorphic VT a/w Acute MI/Ischemia 
- common cause 
- 10% of MI --> VT --> VF (likely reentry from infarct border zone) 
- greatest risk in 1st hour 
- manage with defibrillation according to ACLS --> f/b manage MI 
- Beta blocker + correct electrolyte + reperfusion 
- Repeated episodes of polymorphic VT may suggest ongoing MI and warrant assessment of adequacy of myocardial reperfusion 
- in 48h --> high mortality --> if survive --> no increased risk of SCD 
- LV EF <35% --> ICD 
# Repolarisation abnormalities & Genetic Arrhythmia 
## Acquired Long QT 
- a/w polymorphic VT - TdP 
- characteristic initiation sequence --> PVC --> induces a pause --> sinus beat that has a longer QT interval and interruption of the T wave by the premature ventricular contraction (PVC) that is the first beat of the polymorphic VT
- ![[VT-tdp.png]]
- presentation 
	- near-syncope 
	- syncope 
	- cardiac arrest 
	- PVCs, nonsustained VT --> sustained episode --> V Fib --> Defibrillation 
	- IV MgSO4 1-2g suppress recurrent episodes 
	- if Mg insufficient --> increase HR with isoproterenol infusion / pacing --> HR 100-120/min --> suppresses VPCs and suppresses VT recurrences 
	- correct hyopkalemia, hypocalcemia 
	- correct bradycardia , remove offending drugs 
	- Avoid future drugs which prolong QT

## Congenital Long QT 
- LQTS -- mutation in genes for ion channel of ventricular repolarisation 
- QTc >449ms in men, >460ms in women 
- symptoms d/t TdP VT 
- LQTS-1, LQTS-2 --> K channel defects 
- LQTS-3 --> sodium channel 
- syncope or cardiac arrest in childhood 
- LQTS-1 --> exertional episode , especially swimming 
- LQTS-2 --> sudden auditory , or emotional upset 
- LQTS-3 --> sudden death during sleep 
- LQTS-1 , 2--> beta blocker reduces suddent death risk 
- increased risk 
	- QTc>500ms 
	- female 
	- h/o syncope or cardiac arrest 
- Recurrent syncope despite beta-blocker therapy or a high-risk profile merits consideration of an ICD 
- avoid all QT prolonging drugs 
## Short QT syndrome 
- <360ms, <300ms mostly 
- gain of function in Ikr K channel or reduced inward depolarising current 
- AF, polymorphic VT, sudden death 
## Brugada Syndrome

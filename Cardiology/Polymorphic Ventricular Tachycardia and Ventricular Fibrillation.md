# Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia 
- continuously changing QRS from beat to beat --> continuously changing ventricular activation sequence 
- polymorphic VT does not necessarily indicate a fixed structural abnormality or focus of automaticity 
- Reentry can occur with continually changing reentrant paths, spiral wave reentry, and multiple automatic foci as potential mechanisms 
- sustained polymorphic VT --> VFib 
# Polymorphic VT a/w Acute MI/Ischemia 
- common cause 
- 10% of MI --> VT --> VF (likely reentry from infarct border zone) 
- greatest risk in 1st hour 
- manage with defibrillation according to ACLS --> f/b manage MI 
- Beta blocker + correct electrolyte + reperfusion 
- Repeated episodes of polymorphic VT may suggest ongoing MI and warrant assessment of adequacy of myocardial reperfusion 
- in 48h --> high mortality --> if survive --> no increased risk of SCD 
- LV EF <35% --> ICD 
# Repolarisation abnormalities & Genetic Arrhythmia 
## Acquired Long QT 
- a/w polymorphic VT - TdP

- PRIMARY valve disease 
	- rheumatic --> thickening , deformity , shortening of individual cusps 
	- less common if no associated mitral valve disease 
	- congenital Aortic vakve fenestration --> mild AR 
	- Aortic Cusp prolapse --> progressive chronic AR  (maybe isolated or a/w myxomatous degeneration a/w mitral or tricuspid involvement )
	- IE --> d/t perforation or erosion of leaflet 
	- d/t syphilis or ANKYLOSING SPONDOLYITIS --> scarred and retracted valve 
	- traumatic or avulsion if cusp 
- PRIMARY Aortic Root disease 
	- d/t widening of aortic annulus, lack of diastolic coaptation 
	- Medial degeneration of Ascending aorta 
	- Idiopathic dilation of aorta 
	- annuloaortic ectasia 
	- osteogenesis imperfecta 
	- severe chronic HTN 
	- retrograde dissection of aorta 
	- Syphilis and ankylosing spondylitis --> aortic dilation , aneurysm formation and severe AR 
	- Takayasu Arteritis

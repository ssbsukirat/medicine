- PRIMARY valve disease 
	- rheumatic --> thickening , deformity , shortening of individual cusps 
	- less common if no associated mitral valve disease 
	- congenital Aortic vakve fenestration --> mild AR 
	- Aortic Cusp prolapse --> progressive chronic AR  (maybe isolated or a/w myxomatous degeneration a/w mitral or tricuspid involvement )
	- IE --> d/t perforation or erosion of leaflet 
	- d/t syphilis or ANKYLOSING SPONDOLYITIS --> scarred and retracted valve 
	- traumatic or avulsion if cusp 
- PRIMARY Aortic Root disease 
	- d/t widening of aortic annulus, lack of diastolic coaptation 
	- Medial degeneration of Ascending aorta 
	- Idiopathic dilation of aorta 
	- annuloaortic ectasia 
	- osteogenesis imperfecta 
	- severe chronic HTN 
	- retrograde dissection of aorta 
	- Syphilis and ankylosing spondylitis --> aortic dilation , aneurysm formation and severe AR 
	- Takayasu Arteritis 
# Pathophysiology 
- total stroke volume raised --> LVEF + regurgitant volume in AR 
- in severe AR -- regurgitant flow = effective stroke volume 
- stroke volume has to go to high pressure aorta --> **increase in the LV end-diastolic volume (increased preload)** constitutes the major hemodynamic compensation for AR --> done by dilation and eccentric hypertrophy 
- severe AR may have normal effective forward flow, normal LVEF, **elevated LVEDP and volume** 
- Laplace law -- LV dilation means need for higher LV systolic tension --> so **chronic AR has both high preload and afterload** 
- as disease progress --> rising EDV, stroke volume and EF decline 
- thickening of LV wall --> high weight heart in AR 
- reverse diastolic pressure gradient --> falls in diastole --> typical **decrescendo nature of AR diastolic murmur** . 
- in CHRONIC AR -- aortic = LV pressure at end of diastole 
- in acute severe AR --> LV unprepared --> rapid rise in LV diastole pressure --> >40mmHg sometimes --> premature closure of Mitral valve 
- CO --> normal or slightly reduced, but fails to rise with exercise , in ADVANCE --> elevation of the LA, pulmonary artery (PA) wedge, PA, and right ventricular (RV) pressures and lowering of the forward CO at rest 
- Myocardial ischemia maybe present 
# History 
- 3/4 men 
- women more in PRIMARY valvular AR with associated rheumatic valve disease 
- acute severe AR --> IE, aortic dissection , trauma --> rapid rise in LVDP, LA, PA wedge pressure --> cardiogenic shock or pulmonary edema 
- Chronic Severe AR 
	- long latent 
	- 10-15y asymptomatic 
	- awareness of heartbeat on lying down 
	- sinus tachycardia-induced or VPCs --> palpitations , head pounding 
	- exertional dyspnea --> 1st symptom of reduced cardiac reserve 
	- f/b orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and excessive diaphoresis 
	- Angina in absence of CAD in young also 
	- Nocturnal angina a/w diaphoresis 
	- systemic fluid accumulation late in course 
# Physical 
- jarring of the entire body and the bobbing motion of the head with each systole can be appreciated 
- abrupt distention and collapse of the larger arteries are easily visible 
- try to detect predisposing condition --> BA, IE, Marfan, ANKYLOSING SPONDOLYITIS 
## Arterial Pulse 
- **Corrigans Pulse** --> rapidly rising **water hammer pulse** with sudden collapse 
- Quincke's Pulse --> alternate flushing and paling of skin at root of nails when pressure at tip of nail 
- Traube's sign -- Pistol-shot sound heard over femoral arteries 
- Duroziez's Sign --> to-and-fro murmur on light compression of femoral artery 
- wide PP --> d/t systemic HTN + lowering of diastolic BP 
- Tachycardia to preserve CO 
## Palpation 
- Impulse ---> heaving, displaced lateral and down 
- systolic expansion + diastolic retraction of apex prominent 
- diastolic thrill --> L sternal border 
- Systolic thrill --> suprasternal notch and transmitted along carotids 
- AR or AS+AR --> Bisfiriens pulse --> 2 systolic waves separated by trough 
## Auscultation 
- A2 absent 
- BAV -- systolic ejection sound 
- S4 occasional 
- murmur 
	- high-pitched blowing 
	- decrescendo 
	- diastolic 
	- 3rd ICS along left sternal border 
	- with severity --> louder and longer, indeed holodiastolic 
	- soft, it can be heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope and with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and with the breath held in forced expiration 
	- louder along L>R sternal border 
	- if R>L --> maybe d/t aneurysm dilation of aortic root 
	- Cooing --> musical, s/o eversion of aortic cusp 
- Mid-systolic ejection murmur 
	- isolated AR 
	- base of heart 
	- transmitted along carotid 
	- maybe loud even without obstruction 
- Austin Flint Murmur 
	- severe AR 
	- soft, low-pitched 
	- rumbling 
	- mid-to-late diastolic 
	- diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream
- intensified by handgrip (higher SVR and LV afterload ) 
# LABORATORY 
- ECG 
	- LVH 
	- ST down, T inversion in I, aVL, V5,V6 --> LV strain 
	- LAD 
	- QRS prolongation 
- Echocardiogram 
	- LV size is increased in chronic AR, 
	- systolic function is normal or even supernormal until myocardial contractility declines, as signaled by a decrease in EF or increase in the end- systolic dimension 
	- rapid, high-frequency diastolic fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet produced by the impact of the regurgitant jet is a characteristic 
	- Severe AR if 
		- central jet width assessed by color flow Doppler imaging exceeds 65% of the width of the LV outflow tract, 
		- the regurgitant volume is ≥60 mL/beat, 
		- the regurgitant fraction is ≥50%, and 
		- there is diastolic flow reversal in the proximal portion of the descending thoracic aorta
	- Surveillance TTE for long-term followup 
	- Cardiac MRI 
	- Cardiac CT 
	- TEE 
	- 3D Echocardiogram 
- Chest Xray 
	- apex down and left 
	- left anterior oblique and lateral view --> LV posterior displacement and encroach on spine 
	- Aneurysm dilatation of aorta maybe seen 
- Cardiac Catheterization and Angiography 
	- confirmation of the magnitude of regurgitation and the status of LV function 
	- can also be gained with coronary CT angiographic techniques. 
# Treatment 
- ![[ARtreatment.png]]
## Acute Severe AR 
- respond to intravenous diuretics and vasodilators (such as sodium nitroprusside), but 
- stabilization is usually short-lived and operation is indicated urgently
- Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is contraindicated
- beta-blocker --> avoid to not reduce CO 
- Surgery is the treatment of choice and is usually necessary within 24 h of diagnosis. 
## Chronic AR 
- surgery if --> LV dysfunction or symptoms 
- temporarily --> diuretic , vasodilator (ACE, ARB, CCBs, hydralazine)

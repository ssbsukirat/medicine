- PRIMARY valve disease 
	- rheumatic --> thickening , deformity , shortening of individual cusps 
	- less common if no associated mitral valve disease 
	- congenital Aortic vakve fenestration --> mild AR 
	- Aortic Cusp prolapse --> progressive chronic AR  (maybe isolated or a/w myxomatous degeneration a/w mitral or tricuspid involvement )
	- IE --> d/t perforation or erosion of leaflet 
	- d/t syphilis or ANKYLOSING SPONDOLYITIS --> scarred and retracted valve 
	- traumatic or avulsion if cusp 
- PRIMARY Aortic Root disease 
	- d/t widening of aortic annulus, lack of diastolic coaptation 
	- Medial degeneration of Ascending aorta 
	- Idiopathic dilation of aorta 
	- annuloaortic ectasia 
	- osteogenesis imperfecta 
	- severe chronic HTN 
	- retrograde dissection of aorta 
	- Syphilis and ankylosing spondylitis --> aortic dilation , aneurysm formation and severe AR 
	- Takayasu Arteritis 
# Pathophysiology 
- total stroke volume raised --> LVEF + regurgitant volume in AR 
- in severe AR -- regurgitant flow = effective stroke volume 
- stroke volume has to go to high pressure aorta --> **increase in the LV end-diastolic volume (increased preload)** constitutes the major hemodynamic compensation for AR --> done by dilation and eccentric hypertrophy 
- severe AR may have normal effective forward flow, normal LVEF, **elevated LVEDP and volume** 
- Laplace law -- LV dilation means need for higher LV systolic tension --> so **chronic AR has both high preload and afterload** 
- as disease progress --> rising EDV, stroke volume and EF decline 
- thickening of LV wall --> high weight heart in AR

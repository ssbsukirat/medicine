- aka **Systolic Click syndrome , Barlows syndrome , billowing mitral leaflet syndrome** 
- mc abnormality causing PRIMARY MR 
- pathology 
	- excessive or redundant mitral leaflet tissue, which is commonly associated with myxomatous degeneration and 
	- greatly increased concentrations of certain glycosaminoglycans
	- exact cause unknown --> reduced type 3 collagen implicated 
- seen in connective tissue disease 
	- Marfan 
	- osteogenesis imperfecta 
	- Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome 
- associated with 
	- high arched palate 
	- chest and thoracic spine defects 
	- straight back syndrome 
	- h/o inguinal hernia 
	- joint dislocations 
	- meniscal tears 
	- easy bruisability 
- usually limited to MV, but sometime Tricuspid and aortic maybe involved 
- posterior leaflet > anterior 
- mitral valve annulus dilated 
- other cardiac disease association 
	- acute rheumatic fever 
	- ischemic heart disease 
	- cardiomyopathy 
	- ostium secondum ASD

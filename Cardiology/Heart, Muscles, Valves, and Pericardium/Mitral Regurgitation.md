# ETIOLOGY 
- maybe d/t defect in any of five functional components of the mitral valve apparatus 
	- leaflets --> blunt force trauma or IE --> perforation or destruction 
	- annulus, 
	- chordae tendineae --> acute on chronic MR in myxomatous degeneration 
	- papillary muscles -- acute MI may cause rupture (posteromedial > anterolateral)
	- subjacent myocardium  --> transient MR in ischemia, angina pectoris 
- ![[MRcauses.png]]
- Chronic MR 
	- Primary --> d/t leaflet +/- chordae tendineae involvement 
	- Secondary --> Functional --> d/t LV remodeling , annular dilation, papillary muscle displacement , dyssynchrony , posterior leaflet tethering 
- Rheumatic MR 
	- rigidity , deformity and retraction of valve cusps and 
	- commissural fusion 
	- shortening , contraction and fusion of chordae tendineae 
- Congenital --> AV endocardial cushion defect 
- cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet a/w ostium primum atrial septal defect 
- Radiation MS --> leaflet thickening, retraction, and calcification, often in association with annular and chordal involvement 
- in DCM --> once LV end diastolic dimension is 6cm 
- HOCM --> dynamic MR --> D/t systolic anterior motion of anterior leaflet in narrow LVOT 
- AF --> atrial functional MR --> atrial remodeling and annular dilation with inadequate leaflet lengthening and MR 
- secondary MR d/t LV remodeling > AF 
- MR d/t annular calcification --> encroaches on leaflet or reduces sphincter function --> in advanced renal disease, women >65y, HTN, DM 
- Chronic MR -->

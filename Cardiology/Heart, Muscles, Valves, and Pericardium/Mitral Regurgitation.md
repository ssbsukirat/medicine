# ETIOLOGY 
- maybe d/t defect in any of five functional components of the mitral valve apparatus 
	- leaflets --> blunt force trauma or IE --> perforation or destruction 
	- annulus, 
	- chordae tendineae --> acute on chronic MR in myxomatous degeneration 
	- papillary muscles -- acute MI may cause rupture (posteromedial > anterolateral)
	- subjacent myocardium  --> transient MR in ischemia, angina pectoris 
- ![[MRcauses.png]]
- Chronic MR 
	- Primary --> d/t leaflet +/- chordae tendineae involvement 
	- Secondary --> Functional --> d/t LV remodeling , annular dilation, papillary muscle displacement , dyssynchrony , posterior leaflet tethering 
- Rheumatic MR 
	- rigidity , deformity and retraction of valve cusps and 
	- commissural fusion 
	- shortening , contraction and fusion of chordae tendineae 
- Congenital --> AV endocardial cushion defect 
- cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet a/w ostium primum atrial septal defect 
- Radiation MS --> leaflet thickening, retraction, and calcification, often in association with annular and chordal involvement 
- in DCM --> once LV end diastolic dimension is 6cm 
- HOCM --> dynamic MR --> D/t systolic anterior motion of anterior leaflet in narrow LVOT 
- AF --> atrial functional MR --> atrial remodeling and annular dilation with inadequate leaflet lengthening and MR 
- secondary MR d/t LV remodeling > AF 
- MR d/t annular calcification --> encroaches on leaflet or reduces sphincter function --> in advanced renal disease, women >65y, HTN, DM 
- Chronic MR --> enlarged LA --> posterior mitral leaflet tension --> pulled further from orifice --> progressive MR + LV dilation --> increases regurgitation --> enlarges LA/ LV --> vicious cycle --> **MR begets MR** 
# Pathophysiology 
- resistance to LV emptying (**LV afterload) is reduced** in patients with MR
- LV decompress into LA --> reduced LV size in systole --> rapid decline in LV tension 
- initial compensation --> more complete LV emptying 
- as regurgitation increase --> increased LV volume --> reduced forward CO 
- increased LV compliance --> diastolic pressure not increased until late 
- Regurgitant Volume depends on 
	- LV systolic pressure 
	- size of regurgitant orifice 
		- depends on LV and mitral annular dilatation 
- EF rises in severe MR + normal LV systolic function --> even modest reduction <60% suggests contractile dysfunction 
- in Diastole -> rapid y descent if no MS , early diastolic LA-LV gradient (leading to S3, MDM masquerading as MS) d/t rapid flow across orifice 
- Chronic, severe MR is
	- regurgitant volume ≥60 mL/beat 
	- regurgitant fraction (RF) ≥50%
	- effective regurgitant orifice area ≥0.40 cm2
## LA compliance 
- acute severe MR --> normal size LA with normal or reduced compliance --> high pressures at any volume 
- v wave of LA pressure pulse prominent 
- LA, Pulmonary venous pressure elevated 
- Murmur in acute MR 
	- early in timing and decrescendo in configuration ending well before S2, as a reflection of the progressive diminution in the LV-LA pressure gradient. 
- LV systolic function -> normal, hyperdynamic , reduced in acute MR 
- Chronic MR 
	- marked LA enlargement 
	- increase LA compliance 
	- little if any increase in LA and pulmonary venous pressures for any increase in LA volume. 
	- less prominent w wave 
	- holosystolic murmur with plateau configuration 
	- severe fatigue and exhaustion secondary to a low forward CO, whereas symptoms resulting from pulmonary congestion are less prominent initially
	- AF develop once LA dilates significant 
# Symptoms 
- chronic mild-to-moderate isolated MR asymptomatic 
- Severe, chronic 
	- Fatigue , exertional dyspnea , orthopnea 
	- palpitations a/w AF 
- Late onset right sided HF - hepatic congestion , ankle edema, distended neck veins, ascites, secondary TR 
- acute severe MR -- acute pulmonary edema 
# Physical Findings 
- normal BP 
- carotid pulse -- sharp, low- volume upstroke owing to the reduced forward CO
- systolic thrill at apex + apex displaced laterally
- hyperdynamic LV , S3 
- acute severe MR 
	- low arterial pressure , 
	- narrow PP 
	- JVP normal or exaggerated 
	- apex normal 
	- signs of pulmonary congestion prominent 
## Auscultation 
- S1 --> absent , soft or buried in holosystolic murmur of chronic MR 
- S2 --> wide physiology closing d/t earlier closure of aortic valve 
- S3 low-pitched --> d/t sudden tensing of papillary muscles, chordae tendineae and valve leaflet 
- maybe f/b short rumbling MDM even without MS 
- S4 in acute severe MR with sinus rhythm 
- Systolic Murmur 
	- chronic severe MR 
	- III/VI 
	- holosystolic 
	- decrescendo 
	- ceases in mid-to-late systole in acute severe MR 
	- prominent at apex and radiates to axilla 
	- ruptured chordae tendineae or primary involvement of the posterior mitral leaflet with prolapse or flail --> regurgitant jet is eccentric, directed anteriorly, and strikes the LA wall adjacent to the aortic root --> transmitted to base of heart --> maybe confused with AS 
	- ruptured chordae tendineae --> cooing or "seagull" quality 
	- intensified by isometric exercise (handgrip) but is reduced during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver because of the associated decrease in LV preload --> if not d/t MVP 
# LABORATORY 
- ECG 
	- LA enlargement 
	- RA enlargement if severe PH 
	- AF in chronic 
	- some have eccentric LV hypertrophy 
- Echocardiogram 
	- mechanism of the MR and its hemodynamic severity 
	- LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and EF 
	- leaflet structure and function, chordal integrity, LA and LV size, annular calcification, and regional and global LV systolic function 
	- indicated to follow the course of patients with chronic MR and to provide rapid assessment for any clinical change
	- Exercise testing with TTE can be useful to assess exercise capacity as well as any dynamic change in MR severity, PA systolic pressures, and biventricular function 
- CXRAY 
	- LA LV dominant 
	- late course --> LA massive, enlarged and forms right border of heart 
	- Pulmonary venous congestion, interstitial edema, and Kerley B lines 
	- calcification of the mitral leaflets 
	- Calcification of the mitral annulus may be visualized, particularly on the lateral view 
	- in acute --> asymmetric pulmonary edema if the regurgitant jet is directed predominantly to the orifice of an upper lobe pulmonary vein.

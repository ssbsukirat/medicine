# ETIOLOGY 
- maybe d/t defect in any of five functional components of the mitral valve apparatus 
	- leaflets --> blunt force trauma or IE --> perforation or destruction 
	- annulus, 
	- chordae tendineae --> acute on chronic MR in myxomatous degeneration 
	- papillary muscles -- acute MI may cause rupture (posteromedial > anterolateral)
	- subjacent myocardium

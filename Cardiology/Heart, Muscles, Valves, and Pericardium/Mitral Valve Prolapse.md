# Definition and Terminology

- Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a **relatively common but highly variable clinical syndrome**.
- It results from diverse pathologic mechanisms affecting the mitral valve apparatus.
- Other terms for MVP include:
    - Systolic click-murmur syndrome
    - Barlow’s syndrome
    - Floppy-valve syndrome
    - Billowing mitral leaflet syndrome

# Pathologic Mechanisms and Associated Conditions

- Mechanisms include excessive or redundant mitral leaflet tissue.
- This is commonly associated with **myxomatous degeneration**.
- Myxomatous degeneration involves greatly increased concentrations of certain glycosaminoglycans.
- **Myxomatous degeneration of the valve predisposes to severe regurgitation and chordal rupture**.
- MVP is the **most common abnormality leading to primary mitral regurgitation (MR)**.
- In most patients, the cause of MVP is unknown.
- In some, it appears to be genetically determined.
- A reduction in type III collagen production has been implicated.
- Electron microscopy has revealed fragmentation of collagen fibrils.
- MVP is a frequent finding in patients with **heritable disorders of connective tissue**, including:
    - Marfan syndrome
    - Osteogenesis imperfecta
    - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
- MVP may be associated with thoracic skeletal deformities similar to, but less severe than, those in Marfan syndrome. These can include:
    - A high-arched palate
    - Alterations of the chest and thoracic spine
    - The so-called straight back syndrome
- Other associated features can include a history of:
    - Inguinal hernias
    - Joint dislocations
    - Meniscal tears
    - Easy bruisability
- In most patients, myxomatous degeneration is confined to the mitral valve.
- The tricuspid and aortic valves may also be affected.
- The posterior mitral leaflet is usually more affected than the anterior leaflet.
- The mitral valve annulus is often dilated.
- In many patients, elongated, redundant, or ruptured chordae tendineae cause or contribute to the regurgitation.
- MVP also may occur rarely as a sequel to:
    - Acute rheumatic fever
    - Ischemic heart disease
    - Various cardiomyopathies
- It is also found in 20% of patients with ostium secundum atrial septal defect.
- Prolapse can affect one or both leaflets, to varying degrees.

# Complications and Clinical Course

- MVP may lead to excessive stress on the papillary muscles.
- This, in turn, leads to dysfunction and ischemia of the papillary muscles and subjacent ventricular myocardium.
- Rupture of chordae tendineae and progressive annular dilation and calcification contribute to valvular regurgitation.
- This regurgitation then places more stress on the diseased mitral valve apparatus, creating a vicious cycle.
- ECG changes and ventricular arrhythmias described in some patients appear to result from regional ventricular dysfunction and fibrosis related to increased stress on papillary muscles.
- The clinical course is most often benign.
- In many patients, the condition progresses over years or decades.
- In others, it worsens rapidly as a result of chordal rupture or endocarditis.
- Most patients are asymptomatic and remain so for their entire lives.
- However, in North America, **MVP is now the most common cause of isolated severe MR requiring surgical treatment**.
- Arrhythmias have been reported and may cause palpitations, light-headedness, and syncope. These include:
    - Ventricular premature contractions - mc
    - Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
    - Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia
    - Atrial fibrillation (AF)
- Sudden death is a **very rare complication** -- in severe MR and depressed left ventricle (LV) systolic function 
- Sudden death can occur in individuals with normal LV size and function.
- A small subset of MVP patients with high-grade ventricular ectopy has specific features:
    - Electrocardiographic inferior-apical T-wave abnormalities
    - High-density premature ventricular complexes at rest
    - Mitral annular disjunction (abnormal atrial displacement of leaflet hinge point)
    - Papillary muscle fibrosis on cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement
- There may be an excess risk of sudden death among patients with a flail leaflet.
- Many patients have chest pain that is difficult to evaluate. It is often substernal, prolonged, and **not related to exertion**. Rarely, it may resemble angina pectoris.
- Transient cerebral ischemic attacks have been reported secondary to emboli from the mitral valve due to endothelial disruption.
- Infective endocarditis may occur in patients with MR and/or leaflet thickening.

# Epidemiology

- MVP is **more common in women than men**.
- It occurs most frequently between the ages of 15 and 30 years.
- MVP may also be observed in older (>50 years) patients, often men.
- In older patients, MR is often more severe because of chordal rupture and requires surgical treatment.
- There is an increased familial incidence for some patients --> s/o AD inheritance with incomplete penetrance

# Clinical Features: Auscultation

- A frequent finding is the **mid- or late (nonejection) systolic click**.
- The click occurs 0.14 s or more after S1.
- It is thought to be generated by the sudden tensing of slack, elongated chordae tendineae or by the prolapsing mitral leaflet when it reaches its maximal excursion.
- Systolic clicks may be multiple.
- The click may be followed by a **high-pitched, mid-late systolic crescendo–decrescendo murmur**.
- The murmur is occasionally “whooping” or “honking”.
- It is heard best at the apex.
- Radiation of the murmur depends on the involved leaflet:
    - With posterior leaflet prolapse, the MR jet is directed anteriorly, and the murmur radiates to the base of the heart.
    - With anterior leaflet involvement, the MR jet is directed posteriorly, and the murmur radiates to the axilla and back.
- Maneuvers and interventions affect the click and murmur:
    - The click and murmur occur earlier with 
	    - standing.
	    - strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.
	    - any intervention that decreases LV volume (preload). 
	    - These actions exaggerate the propensity of the leaflet to prolapse.
    - Squatting and isometric exercises, which increase LV volume, diminish MVP.
    - These actions delay the click-murmur complex, move it away from S1, and may even cause it to disappear.
- Some patients have a mid-systolic click without a murmur.
- Others have a murmur without a click.
- Still others have both sounds at different times.

# Laboratory Examination and Imaging

- The ECG most commonly is normal.
- The ECG may show biphasic or inverted T waves in leads II, III, and aVF.
- Occasionally, the ECG may show supraventricular or ventricular premature beats.
- **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is particularly effective in identifying the abnormal position and prolapse** of the mitral valve leaflets.
- A useful echocardiographic definition of MVP is **systolic displacement** (in the parasternal long axis view) **of the belly of the mitral valve leaflets by at least 2 mm into the left atrium (LA)** superior to the plane of the mitral annulus.
- There can be prolapse of one or both leaflets.
- Color flow and continuous wave Doppler imaging is helpful to evaluate the associated MR and provide estimates of severity.
- The jet lesion of MR due to MVP is most often eccentric.
- Assessment of the effective regurgitant orifice area and regurgitant volume can be difficult with standard techniques.
- Both three-dimensional echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can provide more precise determinations of LV volumes.
- **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is indicated when more accurate anatomic information is required**.
- TEE is performed routinely for intraoperative guidance during valve repair.
- Exercise testing can be performed when there is uncertainty regarding functional capacity.
- Exercise testing is often combined with rest and immediate poststress TTE. This is done to assess LV and right ventricular (RV) function and the dynamic nature of MR and pulmonary artery pressures.
- Left ventriculography done at the time of right and left heart catheterization is rarely necessary.
- Left ventriculography can also show prolapse of the posterior and sometimes of both mitral valve leaflets.

# Treatment

- Infective endocarditis prophylaxis is indicated for patients with a prior history of endocarditis.
- Beta blockers sometimes relieve chest pain and control palpitations.
- Decisions regarding anticoagulation for stroke prevention in AF should be based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score and an assessment of bleeding risk.
- **If the patient is symptomatic from severe MR, mitral valve repair is indicated**.
- Other indications for surgery for MVP with severe primary MR include findings of established or progressive LV systolic dysfunction.
- Surgery can also be considered for low-risk asymptomatic patients in whom a successful and durable repair can be achieved with at least 95% likelihood by an expert surgeon.
- **Mitral valve repair is preferred over replacement** in patients with MVP or flail mitral leaflet.
- Technical success is dependent not only on the anatomic findings but also on the skill and experience of the surgeon.
- Repair of isolated posterior leaflet prolapse is usually straightforward.
- Increasingly more complex pathologies (e.g., anterior leaflet prolapse, bileaflet prolapse, Barlow’s deformity) require advanced skills.
- Careful pre- and intraoperative TEE imaging is an important component of patient evaluation and surgical planning.
- Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) using a clip to grasp the anterior and posterior leaflets together can be considered.
- TEER is for treatment of symptomatic patients at prohibitive or high surgical risk with severe primary MR due to MVP.
- Most often, the MR will be reduced in severity but not eliminated with TEER.
- Nevertheless, symptom status and indices of LV size and function can be improved with this approach.
- TEER is now offered at >475 specialized sites in the United States.
- Reported hospital mortality rates following TEER are ∼2%.
- Other transcatheter repair and replacement devices are not yet approved for clinical use in the United States.

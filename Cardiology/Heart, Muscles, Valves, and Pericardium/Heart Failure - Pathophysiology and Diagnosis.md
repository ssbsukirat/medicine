# Clinical Definitions, Epidemiology ,Phenotype 
## Definitions 
- Heart failure (HF) is a common final pathway for most chronic cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease.
- **complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood leading to cardinal manifestations of dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention** --> ACCF/AHA, HFSA 
- ESC --> **emphasizes typical symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (e.g., elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral edema) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress** 
- pathophysiologic terms, HF has been defined as a **syndrome characterized by elevated cardiac filling pressure and/or inadequate peripheral oxygen delivery, at rest or during stress, caused by cardiac dysfunction** 
- **Chronic heart failure** describes patients with longstanding (e.g., months to years) symptoms and/or signs of HF typically treated with medical and device therapy
- **Acute heart failure**, previously termed acute decompensated HF, refers to the rapid onset or worsening of symptoms of HF
- **acute pulmonary edema** in HF describes a clinical scenario in which a patient presents with rapidly worsening signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion, typically due to severe elevation of left heart filling pressure 
## Epidemiology 
- HF increases significantly with age 
- prevalence of HF continues to rise, incidence may be decreasing due to improved recognition and treatment of cardiovascular disease
- blacks followed by Hispanic, white, and Chinese Americans
- disparities in risk factors (e.g., obesity, hypertension, diabetes), socioeconomic status, and access to health care
- hospitalization are highest for black men, followed by black women, white men, and white women 
- Risk Factors ![[HFmortalityRISK.png]]
- each subsequent admission, the risk of death rises. 
## Phenotype 
- Reduced VS Preserved Ejection Fraction 
	- around half reduced, half preserved 
	- most patients with HF (regardless of EF) have abnormalities in both systolic and diastolic function, the older terms of systolic heart failure and diastolic heart failure have fallen out of favor

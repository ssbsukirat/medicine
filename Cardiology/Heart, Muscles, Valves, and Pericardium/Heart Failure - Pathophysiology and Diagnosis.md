increase in

cavity size or volume (eccentric hypertrophy) occurs in volume overload conditions (e.g., aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation)# Clinical Definitions, Epidemiology ,Phenotype 
## Definitions 
- Heart failure (HF) is a common final pathway for most chronic cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease.
- **complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood leading to cardinal manifestations of dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention** --> ACCF/AHA, HFSA 
- ESC --> **emphasizes typical symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (e.g., elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral edema) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress** 
- pathophysiologic terms, HF has been defined as a **syndrome characterized by elevated cardiac filling pressure and/or inadequate peripheral oxygen delivery, at rest or during stress, caused by cardiac dysfunction** 
- **Chronic heart failure** describes patients with longstanding (e.g., months to years) symptoms and/or signs of HF typically treated with medical and device therapy
- **Acute heart failure**, previously termed acute decompensated HF, refers to the rapid onset or worsening of symptoms of HF
- **acute pulmonary edema** in HF describes a clinical scenario in which a patient presents with rapidly worsening signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion, typically due to severe elevation of left heart filling pressure 
## Epidemiology 
- HF increases significantly with age 
- prevalence of HF continues to rise, incidence may be decreasing due to improved recognition and treatment of cardiovascular disease
- blacks followed by Hispanic, white, and Chinese Americans
- disparities in risk factors (e.g., obesity, hypertension, diabetes), socioeconomic status, and access to health care
- hospitalization are highest for black men, followed by black women, white men, and white women 
- Risk Factors ![[HFmortalityRISK.png]]
- each subsequent admission, the risk of death rises. 
## Phenotype 
- Reduced VS Preserved Ejection Fraction 
	- around half reduced, half preserved 
	- most patients with HF (regardless of EF) have abnormalities in both systolic and diastolic function, the older terms of systolic heart failure and diastolic heart failure have fallen out of favor 
	- ![[HFcauses.png]]
- HF with Recovered EF 
	- HFrEF and treated with guideline-directed therapy have rapid or gradual improvement in EF to the normal range and are referred to as having HF with recovered EF (HFrecEF) 
	- HFrecEF predictor 
		- young age 
		- short duration of HF 
		- non-ischemic ETIOLOGY 
		- smaller ventricular volumes 
		- absence of myocardial fibrosis 
	- fulminant myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and tachycardia- induced cardiomyopathy
	- reversible toxin exposures such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or alcohol 
	- symptomatic due to persistent abnormalities in diastolic function or exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension.
	- withdrawal of therapy can lead to recurrence of HF symptoms and decrease in EF 
- HF with Mildly Reduced EF (HFmrEF)
	- 40-50% EF 
	- primarily mild systolic dysfunction with features of diastolic dysfunction 
	- patients with reduced EF who experience improvement in their EF or those with initially preserved EF who suffer a mild decline in their systolic performance. 
- Acquired / Familial / Congenital and other disorders 
	- CAD responsible for 2/3s cases of HF 
	- HTN in 75%, DM in 10-40% 
	- adult with Congenital Heart Disease 
		- uncorrected defects with late presentation due to missed diagnosis, nonintervention, or lack of access to care; 
		- repaired or palliated defects with late valvular and/or ventricular failure; or 
		- failing single-ventricle physiology
	- Inherited Cardiomyopathy 
		- Hypertrophic 
		- Arrhythmogenic 
		- lamin, titin genes 
		- muscular dystrophy 
		- mitochondrial disease 
# Pathophysiology 
- HFrEF is a progressive disease that typically involves an index event followed by months to years of structural and functional cardiovascular remodeling 
- Index event 
	- sudden like MI 
	- gradual as in chronic pressure or volume overload 
	- inherited - GENETIC cardiomyopathy or congenital disease 
- maybe asymptomatic for long time d/t compensatory mechanism --> remodeling 
- ![[HFremodeling.png]]
- Ventricular Remodeling 
	- **Concentric hypertrophy**, in which increased mass is out of proportion to chamber volume, effectively reduces wall stress under **conditions of pressure overload (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis)** 
	- **eccentric hypertrophy** - increase in cavity size or volume occurs in **volume overload conditions (e.g., aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation)**
	- increase in ventricle mass accompanied by 
		- **cellular level** by myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, 
		- at the **protein level** by alteration in calcium- handling and cytoskeletal function, and 
		- at the **molecular level** by re- expression of fetal genes
	- impairment in pump function and increased wall stress in the face of systemic vasoconstriction and loss of neurohormonal adaptation can lead to **afterload mismatch** 
	- ![[HFremodelingmechanisms.png]]
- HFpEF 
	- originally focused on diastolic dysfunction 
	- mainly in older women with HTN 
	- myocyte level --> impaired uptake of cytosolic calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by reductions in adenosine triphosphate --> abnormalities in myocardial relaxation
	- other mechanism 
		- vascular stiffness, 
		- renal dysfunction, 
		- sodium avidity, and 
		- metabolic inflammation related to regional adiposity
## Mechanisms of Disease Progress 
- compensatory mechanism --> contribute to disease progress 
- **Neurohormonal Activation** 
	- Sympathetic nervous system and RAAS activation 
	- initially --> increase heart rate, BP, cardiac contractility sodium & water retention
	- unchecked compensatory responses lead to excessive vasoconstriction and volume retention, electrolyte and renal abnormalities, baroreceptor dysfunction, direct myocardial toxicity, and cardiac arrhythmias 
	- contributes to remodeling of the heart, blood vessels (atherosclerosis), kidneys, and other organs and the development of symptomatic HF
	- antagonism of the RAAS and SNS with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and beta blockers attenuates or reverses ventricular and vascular remodeling and reduces morbidity and mortality
	- ![[HFRaasMechanism.png]]
- **Vasodilatory HORMONE** 
	- number of counterregulatory hormones are upregulated and exert beneficial effects on the heart, kidney, and vasculature. 
	- natriuretic peptides (atrial natriuretic peptide -ANP and B-type natriuretic peptide-BNP) --> stored and released from atria and ventricle d/t increased stretch or pressure --> stimulation of **guanylate cyclase and include systemic and pulmonary vasodilation, increased sodium and water excretion, inhibition of renin and aldosterone, and baroreceptor modulation**, inactivate by neprilysin 
	- prostaglandins (prostaglandin E1--PGE1 and 
	- prostacyclin--PGI2),
	- bradykinin -- inactivated by neprilysin --> blockage is useful 
	- adrenomedullin, and 
	- nitric oxide.
- **Endothelin, Inflammatory Cytokine, Oxidative Stress** 
	- endothelin --> potent vasoconstrictor with role in PAH and RVF 
		- released from vascular and inflammatory cells in pulmonary circulation --> myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis 
		- blockage not shown to be useful 
	- inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and interleukin (IL) 1β and 
	- reactive oxygen species such as superoxide 
- **Novel Biologic Targets**
	- SGLT-2 --> located on the proximal tubule of the kidney --> reabsorption of up to 90% of filtered glucose 
	- activity of SGLT-2 contributes to sodium and water retention, endothelial dysfunction, abnormal myocardial metabolism, and impaired calcium handling
	- SGLT2 inhibitors --> initially for DM --> but now beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality in HF 
	- effects d/t --> diuretic effects or to effects on cardiac and vascular remodeling, proarrhythmia, renal function, and/or metabolic function or inflammation 
	- **Oral soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators** enhance the cGMP pathway and exert beneficial myocardial and vascular effects in experimental and clinical HF. 
- Dyssynchrony & Electrical Instability 
	- 1/3 of HF have QRS prolongation 
	- LBBB or IVCD --> abnormal ventricular contraction 
	- left or biventricular pacing can improve contractile function, decrease mitral regurgitation, and reverse ventricular remodeling
	- HFrEF + LBBB --> medical + cardiac resynchronization therapy is indicated to reduce morbidity and mortality. 
	- AF with FVR and frequent VPCs can worsen HF
	- involves increased wall stress, neurohormonal activation, and inflammation 
- Secondary MR 
	- D/t distortion in the mitral valve apparatus and includes the effects of various pathophysiologic mechanisms 
		- reduced contractile force --> decreased coaptation of the leaflets, 
		- spherical shape of the ventricle --> influences length and function of the chordal-papillary muscle structure, 
		- increased dimension of the mitral annulus (and inability of the annulus to contract during systole) with reduced leaflet alignment,
		- and dilation of the posterior wall of the left atrium --> distorts the posterior leaflet of the valve
	- treating the mitral valve using transcatheter techniques when patients are carefully selected after exposure to optimal medical therapy when residual and significant secondary mitral regurgitation persists 
- Cardiorenal and abdominal Interactions 
	- systemic disease 
	- many of the presenting signs and symptoms are related to end-organ failure, including dysfunction of the kidneys, liver, and lungs
	- with kidneys --> increases circulating volume, worsens symptoms of HF, and results in disease progression, referred to as the **cardiorenal syndrome**
		- initially thought to be d/t decreased cardiac output --> hypoperfusion 
		- now, even systemic congestion --> increased back pressure --> worsening renal function 
		- relief of venous congestion --> improves renal function 
	- splanchnic veins serve as a blood reservoir and actively function in regulation of cardiac preload during changes in volume status, regulated by transmural pressure changes or mechanisms of systemic sympathetic activation
	- Splanchnic congestion --> portal vein distension + activation of the hepatorenal reflex + splenorenal reflex, --> renal vasoconstriction
- GUT CONGESTION, THE MICROBIOME, AND INFLAMMATION 
	- circulating proinflammatory cytokines elevated in HF 
	- alteration in gut MICROBIOME + loss of diversity --> role in inflammation 
	- Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels raised in HF & increased intestinal permeability in congestive states 
	- LPS --> immune stimulator --> macrophage activation --> high TNF-α , IL1, IL6 --> progressive loss of cardiac function + **cardiac cachexia** 
	- association between gut microbe–dependent generation of trimethylamine N-oxide derived from specific dietary nutrients such as choline and carnitine and poor outcomes in patients with both acute and chronic HF
- High Output States 
	- minority patients have high output state + low Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) 
	- most --> low CO + high SVR 
	- chronic anemia <8g/dL --> high CO --> increased vasodilatory cytokine --> low SVR --> if with ischemic or valvular heart disease --> may precipitate failure 
	- CKD --> may develop HF when Anemia + high flow through AV fistula 
# Evaluation 
## History 
- Symptoms of Congestion: Pulmonary Versus Systemic 
	- mc symptoms --> volume overload with elevation in pulmonary and/or systemic venous pressures
	- Shortness of Breath --> Cardinal of left HF --> exertional dyspnea, orthopnea , PND, Dyspnea at rest 
	- Mechanism --> pulmonary venous congestion + transudation of fluid into the interstitium and/or alveoli, --> decreased lung compliance, increased airway resistance, hypoxemia, and ventilation/perfusion mismatch
	- juxtacapillary J receptors ++ --> increased ventilatory drive + reduced blood flow to respiratory muscle --> lactic acidosis 
	- NYHA class does not correlate well with other objective measures of cardiac structure (e.g., left ventricular size, EF) or function (e.g., peak oxygen consumption). 
	- ![[NYHAclass.png]]
	- Orthopnea 
		- dyspnea in recumbent position 
		- d/t 
			- redistribution of fluid --> abdomen, lower body --> chest 
			- increased work of breathing (d/t reduced lung compliance) 
			- if ascites or hepatomegaly --> diaphragm elevation 
		- in 1-2min of lying down 
		- for some, orthopnea may diminish as symptoms of right HF appear.
		- maybe a/w nocturnal cough d/t congestion 
	- Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnea (PND) 
		- episodes of shortness of breath that awaken a patient suddenly from sleep with feelings of anxiety and suffocation and require sitting upright for relief 
		- occurs after prolonged recumbency, is less predictable in occurrence, and may require 30 min or longer in the upright position for relief 
		- a/w coughing and wheezing (so-called **cardiac asthma**) thought to be due to increased bronchial arterial pressure leading to airway compression and interstitial pulmonary edema causing increased airway resistance
	- right HF --> systemic congestion 
		- Weight gain and lower extremity edema --> initial manifestations 
		- followed by --> gastrointestinal symptoms due to edema of the bowel wall and hepatic congestion.
		- bloating, anorexia, and early satiety are common 
		- RUQ pain d/t stretching of hepatic capsule 
		- maybe misdiagnosed as biliary tract disease 
		- in refractory right HF, the **development of massive edema involving the entire body with recurrent pleural effusions and/or ascites is termed anasarca.**
- Symptoms of reduced perfusion 
	- decreased CO, sometimes referred to as low-output syndrome 
	- Fatigue and weakness, particularly of the lower extremities, are nonspecific symptoms that can occur with exertion or at rest 
	- in elderly with cerebrovascular disease + HF --> reduced systemic perfusion may result in mental dullness, depressed affect, and confusion
- Others 
	- mood disturbance 
	- poor sleep 
	- Nocturia due to improved CO and renal perfusion in the supine position, in addition to delayed diuretic effects, can also contribute to sleep disturbances 
	- oliguria --> maybe sign of advanced HF 
- PRECIPITATING FACTORS 
	- ![[HFPrecipitatingFactors.png]]
## Physical Examination 
- General Appearace 
	- mild to moderate --> well nourished and comfortable at rest 
	- advanced --> may be in no distress after resting for a few minutes but may demonstrate dyspnea with minimal exertion such as walking across the room 
	- severe HF --> sit upright + anxious, diaphoretic, and dyspneic at rest with pallor due to anemia or duskiness due to low output
	- cool extremities and peripheral cyanosis 
	- ![[CardiacCachexia.png]]
- Vital 
	- initially HR and BP high in new-onset HF 
	- resting HR <70-75/min on therapy 
	- BP in normal to low-normal range 
	- irregular rhythm --> AF, Flutter, frequent APCs, VPCs 
	- severe HF --> hypotension , narrow PP , rapid thready pulse 
	- alternate strong and weak pulse --> pulsus alternans --> reduced left ventricular contraction in every other cardiac cycle due to incomplete recovery causing alternation in the left ventricular stroke volume 
	- RR - Normal at rest, more in lying down or exertion 
	- Periodic or Cheyne-Stokes Respirations ini ADVANCE HF 
		- patient is usually unaware of the altered breathing pattern, but family members or friends may become alarmed or attribute this incorrectly to anxiety 
	- SpO2 normal unless 
		- pulmonary edema acute 
		- CHD with shunting 
		- severe PAH 
		- concomitant acute or chronic lung disease 
	- low grade fever d/t cytokine 
- JVP 
	- estimate Right heart pressure 
	- examined at a 45° angle, and jugular venous pressure (JVP) is quantified in centimeters of water by estimating the height of the venous column of blood above the sternal angle in centimeters and then adding 5 
	- in mild right HF --> normal JVP (<8cm H2O) but rises with compressing RUQ 
	- **Hepatojugular Reflex** --> applying firm continuous pressure over the liver for 15–30 s while observing the neck veins
	- **abdominojugular test,** defined as an increase in right atrial pressure during 10 s of firm midabdominal compression followed by an abrupt drop on pressure release, **suggests elevated left-sided filling pressure** 
	- rise in JVP with inspiration or **Kussmaul’s sign** may be due to severe biventricular HF and is a marker of poor outcome.
- Lung 
	- Rales 
		- Result from transudation of fluid from the intravascular space into the alveoli and airways
		- heard at bases 
		- in severe HF or acute pulmonary edema --> throughout lung fields 
		- absent in patients with longstanding HF and chronically elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressures due to increased lymphatic drainage
	- Pleural Effusion 
		- biventricular or predominant right HF, **bilateral** --> dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds at the bases. 
		- if **unilateral**, they typically involve the **right** side
- Cardiac Examination 
	- chronic HF --> cardiac enlargement 
		- apical impulse -->down and left 
			- diffuse in DCM 
			- sustained in pressure overload like AS 
	- biventricular /severe Right HF --> parasternal RV heave/lift at left sternal border 
	- palpable S3 --> uncommon 
	- HFpEF --> palpation normal 
	- auscultation --> S3 gallop in volume overload and tachycardia --> s/o hemodynamic compromise and poor prognosis 
	- S4 --> not specific to HF but maybe seen in HFpEF d/t HTN 
	- MR/TR holosystolic murmurs in advanced HF in absence of structural anomaly 
	- in secondary PAH --> loud P2 
- Abdomen 
	- hepatomegaly early sign 
	- tender liver edge --> early but disappear later 
	- pulsatile liver in TR 
	- cardiac cirrhosis --> longstanding congestion --> splenomegaly and mild to moderate ascites 
	- if massive ascites --> look for other causes 
- bilateral symmetric pitting extremity edema 
- Anasarca is used to describe massive, generalized edema involving the legs, sacrum, and abdominal wall 

## Diagnosis 
- signs and symptoms not sensitive or specific 
- high index of suspicion in older, CVS disease , comorbid like HTN, Diabetes , CKD 
- ![[HFassessment.png]]
## ROUTINE LAbs 
- metabolic panel, complete blood count, coagulation studies, and urinalysi 
- evaluate DM, dyslipidemia , thyroid function 
- Renal function maybe deranged 
- proteinuria --> in DM, HTN, systemic disease 
- modest elevation in transaminase , ALP, bilirubin 
- marked high transaminase , lactic acid --> cardiogenic shock with low-output state 
- cardiac cirrhosis, hypoalbuminemia may exacerbate fluid accumulation, whereas hyperammonemia contributes to altered mental status 
- ESR, CRP, uric acid --> not diagnostic 
- antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, serum free light chains, serum protein electrophoresis, ferritin, ceruloplasmin, hepatitis C, and HIV, are reserved for **targeted testing.**
- Electrolyte 
	- Hyponatremia --> sodium restriction , diuretic therapy , vasopressin induced free water retention 
		- negative prognostic marker 
	- hypokalemia -> thiazide and loop  diuretic, increased aldosterone levels 
	- hyperkalemia --> reduced GFR, exacerbated by RAAS inhibitors , potassium sparing diuretics 
	- hypo/hyperkalemia --> ventricular arrhythmia 
	- hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia --> chronic alcohol use 
- Anemia --> exacerbate HF , should be corrected 
	- IDA --> decreased gut absorption, impaired hepatic storage, and chronic blood loss. 
## Chest XRAY 
- left HF include enlarged cardiac silhouette **(cardiothoracic ratio >0.5)** and pulmonary venous congestion
- upper zone venous redistribution and thickening of interlobular septa 
- PCWP moderate to severely elevated, alveolar edema can present as diffuse haziness extending downward toward the lower lung fields
- if absent --> increased lymphatic drainage of interstitial or pulmonary fluids 
- pleural effusion 
- may see pneumonia, COPD 
## ECG 
- tells underlying cardiac disease 
- not diagnostic 
- LVH, LAH --> HFpEF d/t HTN, AS, HOCM 
- Q waves or infarct --> IHD 
- Q wave + reduced QRS voltage (pseudo-infarct pattern) --> restrictive or infiltrative cardiomyopathy eg amyloid 
- Conduction system disease should raise concern for cardiac sarcoid or Chagas cardiomyopathy in the right clinical setting. 
- Paroxysmal or persistent AF in 40% of HF 
- PVCs and nonsustained VT --> reflect worsening HF and markers of increased risk 
- frequent VPCs --> may cause cardiomyopathy --> resolve with ablation 
- QRS width and presence of LBBB --> cardiac resynchronization therapy
## Noninvasive IMAGING 
- 2D ECHO 
	- ventricular size and function 
	- intracavitary thrombus and pericardial effusion 
	- If LVEF >50% --> normal systolic function 
	- Myocardial strain rate imaging using speckle tracking --> prognostic value 
	- Doppler --> CO, pulmonary artery pressures, and valve areas, and may detect abnormalities in left ventricular diastolic filling in patients with HFpEF 
	- TEE --> r/o intracardiac thrombus before cardioversion , aortic, mitral valve pathology 
- Cardiac MRI (CMR) 
	- quantitative tool for evaluation of left ventricular mass, volumes, and function and for determining specific causes of HF (e.g., ischemic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis) 
	- anatomical and functional anomaly in adults with CHD 
	- Serial CMR --> ventricular remodeling response to therapy 
- CT Cardiac 
	- if cannot undergo MRI 
	- rule out pericardial disease or left ventricular apical thrombus 
- PET CT 
	- evaluating the extent of ischemia or infarction in patients with coronary artery disease and,
	- in the case of sarcoid, can reliably determine the severity and distribution of cardiac inflammation 
## Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing 
- not routine done in HF 
- symptom-limited, ramp protocol can provide an objective assessment of peak functional capacity in patients being evaluated for mechanical circulatory support or heart transplant 
- VO2, ventilatory efficiency - VE/VCO2 slope --> independent predictor of survival 
- heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise and exercise-induced arrhythmias can also be assessed 
## Biomarker 
- BNP and NT-proBNP --> atria and ventricle in response to wall stress --> 
	- HFrEF > HFpEF (levels) 
	- falsely low in obese 
	- ambulatory + dyspnea --> helps diagnosis 
	- in chronic HF --> establish disease severity and prognostic 
	- age, female sex, and chronic kidney disease, increase natriuretic peptide levels 
	- AF, PTE, PAH increase NT-proBNP 
- Galactin-3 and soluble ST2 are new markers 
## Invasive Study 
- ICU setting 
- cardiac filling pressure and CO 
- pulmonary artery catheter --> response to IV vasoactive and diuretc therapy --> bedside
- catheterisation laboratory --> right and left heart filling

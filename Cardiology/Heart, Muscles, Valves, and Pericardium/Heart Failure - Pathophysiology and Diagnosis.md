# Clinical Definitions, Epidemiology ,Phenotype 
## Definitions 
- Heart failure (HF) is a common final pathway for most chronic cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and valvular heart disease.
- **complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood leading to cardinal manifestations of dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention** --> ACCF/AHA, HFSA 
- ESC --> **emphasizes typical symptoms (e.g., breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (e.g., elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral edema) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress** 
- pathophysiologic terms, HF has been defined as a **syndrome characterized by elevated cardiac filling pressure and/or inadequate peripheral oxygen delivery, at rest or during stress, caused by cardiac dysfunction** 
- **Chronic heart failure** describes patients with longstanding (e.g., months to years) symptoms and/or signs of HF typically treated with medical and device therapy
- **Acute heart failure**, previously termed acute decompensated HF, refers to the rapid onset or worsening of symptoms of HF
- **acute pulmonary edema** in HF describes a clinical scenario in which a patient presents with rapidly worsening signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion, typically due to severe elevation of left heart filling pressure 
## Epidemiology 
- HF increases significantly with age

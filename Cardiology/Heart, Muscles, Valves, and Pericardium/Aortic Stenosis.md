Epidemiology from book 


- mc valvular lesion in patient with chronic valvular disease 
- male > female 
# ETIOLOGY and PATHOGENESIS 
- d/t degenerative calcification of aortic cusps 
- mc in congenital BAV, chronic trileaflet deterioration or previous rheumatic inflammation 
- active deterioration and calcification --> f/ vascular atherosclerosis , endothelial dysfunction , lipid accumulation , inflammatory cell activation , cytokine release , upregulation of signaling pathways 
- Genetic 
	- vit D receptor 
	- Estrogen receptor 
	- IL10 
	- apolipoprotein E4 
- risk factor 
	- HTN 
	- LDL 
	- Lipoprotein a 
	- DM 
	- Smoking 
	- CKD 
	- Metabolic syndrome

- Rheumatic disease of Aortic valve 
	- commissural fusion --> may cause bicuspid valve 
	- more susceptible to trauma and ultimately leads to fibrosis, calcification, and further narrowing 
	- Rheumatic AS always a/w Mitral involvement + AR 
# Bicuspid Aortic Valve 
- mc congenital valve defect 
- 2-4:1 male:female 
- AD with incomplete penetrance 
- maybe X linked...in turners 
- mutations in the NOTCH1, GATA5, and GATA4 genes 
- NKX2.5 -- NO synthase mutation 
- Medial degeneration with ascending aortic aneurysm formation occurs commonly >> Aortic cooarctation 
- BAV have larger aortas -- directional shear forces dictated by the anatomic configuration of the valve
- Ascending aorta enlargement --> a/w right-left cup fusion (mc variant) 
# LVO Obstrucion 
- valvular AS 
- HOCM 
- discrete fibromuscular/membranous subaortic stenosis 
- suprvalvular AS 
## Pathophysiology 
- systolic pressure gradient b/w LV and Aorta 
- slow obstruction --> LV performance maintained by concentric Hypertrophy --> initially adaptive and helpful 
- as progresses --> excessive hypertrophy --> LV function decline (d/t afterload mismatch ) --> abnormalities of diastolic dysfunction --> irreversible myocardial fibrosis 
- Severe LVO obstruction 
	- Mean systolic pressure gradient >40mmHg 
	- effective Aortic orific <1cm2 (or <0.6cm2/m2 BSA) ~<1/3 of normal 
- diminished compliance of hypertrophy LV --> high EDP in severe AS + preserved EF 
- CO --> maybe normal at rest --> fails to increase with exercise 
- loss of timed, vigorous atrial contraction (AF or AV dissociation) --> rapid progress of symptoms 
- Late course 
	- decline in contractility --> afterload is high

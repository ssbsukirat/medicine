Epidemiology from book 


- mc valvular lesion in patient with chronic valvular disease 
- male > female 
# ETIOLOGY and PATHOGENESIS 
- d/t degenerative calcification of aortic cusps 
- mc in congenital BAV, chronic trileaflet deterioration or previous rheumatic inflammation 
- active deterioration and calcification --> f/ vascular atherosclerosis , endothelial dysfunction , lipid accumulation , inflammatory cell activation , cytokine release , upregulation of signaling pathways 
- Genetic 
	- vit D receptor 
	- Estrogen receptor 
	- IL10 
	- apolipoprotein E4 
- risk factor 
	- HTN 
	- LDL 
	- Lipoprotein a 
	- DM 
	- Smoking 
	- CKD 
	- Metabolic syndrome

- Rheumatic disease of Aortic valve 
	- commissural fusion --> may cause bicuspid valve 
	- more susceptible to trauma and ultimately leads to fibrosis, calcification, and further narrowing 
	- Rheumatic AS always a/w Mitral involvement + AR

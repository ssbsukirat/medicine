Epidemiology from book 


- mc valvular lesion in patient with chronic valvular disease 
- male > female 
# ETIOLOGY and PATHOGENESIS 
- d/t degenerative calcification of aortic cusps 
- mc in congenital BAV, chronic trileaflet deterioration or previous rheumatic inflammation 
- active deterioration and calcification --> f/ vascular atherosclerosis , endothelial dysfunction , lipid accumulation , inflammatory cell activation , cytokine release , upregulation of signaling pathways 
- Genetic 
	- vit D receptor 
	- Estrogen receptor 
	- IL10 
	- apolipoprotein E4 
- risk factor 
	- HTN 
	- LDL 
	- Lipoprotein a 
	- DM 
	- Smoking 
	- CKD 
	- Metabolic syndrome

- Rheumatic disease of Aortic valve 
	- commissural fusion --> may cause bicuspid valve 
	- more susceptible to trauma and ultimately leads to fibrosis, calcification, and further narrowing 
	- Rheumatic AS always a/w Mitral involvement + AR 
# Bicuspid Aortic Valve 
- mc congenital valve defect 
- 2-4:1 male:female 
- AD with incomplete penetrance 
- maybe X linked...in turners 
- mutations in the NOTCH1, GATA5, and GATA4 genes 
- NKX2.5 -- NO synthase mutation 
- Medial degeneration with ascending aortic aneurysm formation occurs commonly >> Aortic cooarctation 
- BAV have larger aortas -- directional shear forces dictated by the anatomic configuration of the valve
- Ascending aorta enlargement --> a/w right-left cup fusion (mc variant) 
# LVO Obstrucion 
- valvular AS 
- HOCM 
- discrete fibromuscular/membranous subaortic stenosis 
- suprvalvular AS 
## Pathophysiology 
- systolic pressure gradient b/w LV and Aorta 
- slow obstruction --> LV performance maintained by concentric Hypertrophy --> initially adaptive and helpful 
- as progresses --> excessive hypertrophy --> LV function decline (d/t afterload mismatch ) --> abnormalities of diastolic dysfunction --> irreversible myocardial fibrosis 
- Severe LVO obstruction 
	- Mean systolic pressure gradient >40mmHg 
	- effective Aortic orific <1cm2 (or <0.6cm2/m2 BSA) ~<1/3 of normal 
- diminished compliance of hypertrophy LV --> high EDP in severe AS + preserved EF 
- CO --> maybe normal at rest --> fails to increase with exercise 
- loss of timed, vigorous atrial contraction (AF or AV dissociation) --> rapid progress of symptoms 
- Late course 
	- decline in contractility --> afterload is high 
	- CO falls --> LV-aortic pressure gradient falls 
	- LA, PA , RV pressures rise 
	- further compromised if epicardial CAD 
	- CO further low in significant hypertrophy and a small LV cavity despite a normal EF. 
- Low-flow (stroke volume index <35ml/m2), low gradient (mean pressure gradient <40mmHg ) AS is therapeutic challenge 
# Symptoms 
- insignificant if orifice >1cm2 
- maybe asymptomatic for long --> as LV hypertrophy compensate for function 
- **when EF below normal or symptoms --> replacement** 
- pure/predominant AS --> asymptomatic till 6th-8th decade 
- if BAV in adult --> symptoms 1-2 decades earlier 
- symptoms 
	- **exertional dyspnea** -- slow progress, reduced effort tolerance, curtailment of activity --> d/t 
		- elevation of PCWP d/t elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to impaired relaxation and reduced LV compliance
	- **angina pectoris** -- imbalance in high O2 demand and reduced availability , coexist with CAD in >65y 
	- **syncope** -- exertional d/t 
		- decline in arterial pressure caused by vasodilation in exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or
		- from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia
	- Late course 
		- fatiguability 
		- weakness 
		- peripheral cyanosis 
		- cachexia 
		- Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pulmonary edema, i.e., symptoms of LV failure
		- severe PAH --> RV failure 
		- hepatomegaly 
		- AF 
		- TR 
	- AS + MS 
		- redced CO d/t MS --> reduced gradient --> masks clinical finding 
# Physical Finding 
- regular rhythm until late 
- if AF --> think mitral valve disease 
- HTN common 
- when stroke volume declines, the systolic pressure may fall and the **pulse pressure narrow** 
- carotid arterial pulse rises slowly to a delayed peak (**pulsus parvus et tardus**)
- **thrill or anacrotic “shudder”** may be palpable over the carotid arteries, more commonly the left
- a wave of JVP accentuated 
- displaced lateral LV impulse late 
- **double apical impulse + palpable S4** in left lateral recumbent 
- systolic thrill --> base of heart to right of sternum when leaning forward 
## Auscultation 
- early ejection systolic sound --> in young with BAV --> disappear when valve is calcified and rigid 
- as AS severity increases --> LV systole prolonged --> reduced S2 split and later Paradoxical split 
- S4 at apex --> LVH and elevated LV EDP 
- S3 late in course -- when systolic function compromised

Epidemiology from book 


- mc valvular lesion in patient with chronic valvular disease 
- male > female 
# ETIOLOGY and PATHOGENESIS 
- d/t degenerative calcification of aortic cusps 
- mc in congenital BAV, chronic trileaflet deterioration or previous rheumatic inflammation 
- active deterioration and calcification --> f/ vascular atherosclerosis , endothelial dysfunction , lipid accumulation , inflammatory cell activation , cytokine release , upregulation of signaling pathways 
- Genetic 
	- vit D receptor 
	- Estrogen receptor 
	- IL10 
	- apolipoprotein E4 
- risk factor 
	- HTN 
	- LDL 
	- Lipoprotein a 
	- DM 
	- Smoking 
	- CKD 
	- Metabolic syndrome
- ![[AScauses.png]]
- Rheumatic disease of Aortic valve 
	- commissural fusion --> may cause bicuspid valve 
	- more susceptible to trauma and ultimately leads to fibrosis, calcification, and further narrowing 
	- Rheumatic AS always a/w Mitral involvement + AR 
# Bicuspid Aortic Valve 
- mc congenital valve defect 
- 2-4:1 male:female 
- AD with incomplete penetrance 
- maybe X linked...in turners 
- mutations in the NOTCH1, GATA5, and GATA4 genes 
- NKX2.5 -- NO synthase mutation 
- Medial degeneration with ascending aortic aneurysm formation occurs commonly >> Aortic cooarctation 
- BAV have larger aortas -- directional shear forces dictated by the anatomic configuration of the valve
- Ascending aorta enlargement --> a/w right-left cup fusion (mc variant) 
# LVO Obstrucion 
- valvular AS 
- HOCM 
- discrete fibromuscular/membranous subaortic stenosis 
- suprvalvular AS 
## Pathophysiology 
- systolic pressure gradient b/w LV and Aorta 
- slow obstruction --> LV performance maintained by concentric Hypertrophy --> initially adaptive and helpful 
- as progresses --> excessive hypertrophy --> LV function decline (d/t afterload mismatch ) --> abnormalities of diastolic dysfunction --> irreversible myocardial fibrosis 
- Severe LVO obstruction 
	- Mean systolic pressure gradient >40mmHg 
	- effective Aortic orific <1cm2 (or <0.6cm2/m2 BSA) ~<1/3 of normal 
- diminished compliance of hypertrophy LV --> high EDP in severe AS + preserved EF 
- CO --> maybe normal at rest --> fails to increase with exercise 
- loss of timed, vigorous atrial contraction (AF or AV dissociation) --> rapid progress of symptoms 
- Late course 
	- decline in contractility --> afterload is high 
	- CO falls --> LV-aortic pressure gradient falls 
	- LA, PA , RV pressures rise 
	- further compromised if epicardial CAD 
	- CO further low in significant hypertrophy and a small LV cavity despite a normal EF. 
- Low-flow (stroke volume index <35ml/m2), low gradient (mean pressure gradient <40mmHg ) AS is therapeutic challenge 
# Symptoms 
- insignificant if orifice >1cm2 
- maybe asymptomatic for long --> as LV hypertrophy compensate for function 
- **when EF below normal or symptoms --> replacement** 
- pure/predominant AS --> asymptomatic till 6th-8th decade 
- if BAV in adult --> symptoms 1-2 decades earlier 
- symptoms 
	- **exertional dyspnea** -- slow progress, reduced effort tolerance, curtailment of activity --> d/t 
		- elevation of PCWP d/t elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to impaired relaxation and reduced LV compliance
	- **angina pectoris** -- imbalance in high O2 demand and reduced availability , coexist with CAD in >65y 
	- **syncope** -- exertional d/t 
		- decline in arterial pressure caused by vasodilation in exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or
		- from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia
	- Late course 
		- fatiguability 
		- weakness 
		- peripheral cyanosis 
		- cachexia 
		- Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pulmonary edema, i.e., symptoms of LV failure
		- severe PAH --> RV failure 
		- hepatomegaly 
		- AF 
		- TR 
	- AS + MS 
		- redced CO d/t MS --> reduced gradient --> masks clinical finding 
# Physical Finding 
- regular rhythm until late 
- if AF --> think mitral valve disease 
- HTN common 
- when stroke volume declines, the systolic pressure may fall and the **pulse pressure narrow** 
- carotid arterial pulse rises slowly to a delayed peak (**pulsus parvus et tardus**)
- **thrill or anacrotic “shudder”** may be palpable over the carotid arteries, more commonly the left
- a wave of JVP accentuated 
- displaced lateral LV impulse late 
- **double apical impulse + palpable S4** in left lateral recumbent 
- systolic thrill --> base of heart to right of sternum when leaning forward 
## Auscultation 
- early ejection systolic sound --> in young with BAV --> disappear when valve is calcified and rigid 
- as AS severity increases --> LV systole prolonged --> reduced S2 split and later Paradoxical split 
- S4 at apex --> LVH and elevated LV EDP 
- S3 late in course -- when systolic function compromised 
- Murmur 
	- ejection mid systolic murmur shortly after S1 
	- peak at middle of ejection --> ends before valve closure 
	- low-pitched, rough, rasping, loudest at base (2nd right ICS)
	- transmitted upward along carotid 
	- occasional transmitted downward to apex --> maybe confused with systolic MR murmur (**gallavardin effect**)
	- grade III/VI 
	- if low CO (severe with HF) or low obstruction -- soft and brief murmur 
# LABORATORY 
- ECG 
	- LVH 
	- ST down T wave inversion in I and aVL and left precordial leads 
	- no correlation with severity 
	- absence of LVH does not exclude 
- Echocardiogram 
	- thickening , calcification , reduced systolic opening of valve leaflet 
	- LVH 
	- Eccentric closure in congenital BAV 
	- TEE better but not needed 
	- Doppler - valve gradient , aortic valve area 
	- Severe AS --> area <1cm2 
	- Moderate --> 1-1.5cm2 
	- Mild - 1.5-2cm2 
	- Aortic valve sclerosis, conversely, is accompanied by a jet velocity of <2.5 m/s (peak gradient <25 mmHg) 
	- impaired diastolic function on doppler indices 
	- in AS with severe LV dysfunction --> low flow, low gradient --> dobutamine stress echocardiogram 
	- severe AS (i.e., valve area <1cm2) with a relatively low mean gradient (<40 mmHg) despite a normal EF (low-flow, low-gradient, severe AS with normal EF) are often hypertensive --> correct BP before repeat doppler echo 
	- if CO reduced with doubtful severity --> CT Chest for aortic valve calcium level 
	- CT angiography --> IOC for planning transcatheter aortic valve implant (TAVI) 
	- Cardiac MRI 
- Chest Xray 
	- no changes for long 
	- Hypertrophy without dilation --> rounding of apex in frontal and slight backward displacement in lateral 
	- dilated proximal ascending aorta in frontal along right heart border  
	- AV calcification in lateral 
	- late in disease --> LV enlargement, pulmonary congestion, and enlargement of the LA, PA, and right-sided heart chambers. 
- Catheterization 
	- may increase risk of cerebral emboli if aortic valve crossed 
	- used in 
		- patient with multivalvular disease 
		- young, asymptomatic with noncalcific congenital AS (as PABV maybe needed if not symptomatic also)
		- suspected supra- or sub- valvular LVO obstruction 
	- Coronary angiography if valve intervention planned 
# Natural History 
- 7th-8th decade --> death 
- onset of symptoms to death 
	- angina - 3 years 
	- syncope - 3 years 
	- dyspnea - 2years 
	- HF - 1.5-2 years 
- sudden death in 10-20% 
- 1% risk of SCD as 1st presentation of AS
- Calcific AS is progressive --> 0.1cm2/year 
	- jeat velocity and mean valve gradient --> 0.3m/s and 7mmg per year 
# Treatment 
- ![[AStreatment.png]]
- Stages 
	- A - risk factors + 
	- B - progressive , mild-to-moderate asymptomatic valve disease 
	- C1 - severe AS with asymptomatic and compensated cardiac function 
	- C2 - asymptomatic , severe, decompensated ventricle function 
	- D1 - severe, symptomatic , high gradient  >40mmHg 
	- D2 severe, symptomatic low-flow , low-gradient with reduced EF 
	- D3 symptomatic, severe, low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction
- Medical 
	- avoid strenous physical activity and competitive sports if severe (even if asymptomatic )
	- avoid dehydration , hypovolemia 
	- asymptomatic , preserved LVEF -- beta blockers, ACE inhibitors safe 
	- Nitroglycerin safe in CAD 
	- statins, RAAS blockage --> dont slow disease 
	- IE prophylaxis --> only if h/o IE 
- SURGICAL 
	- indication 
		- severe (<1cm2 or 0.6cm2/BSA) + symptomatic 
		- LVEF <50% 
		- AS with BAV with aortic root aneurysm (>5.5cm in max dimension) 
		- aneurysm 4.5-5cm if family h/o aortic catastrophe or rapid aneurysm growth (>0.5cm/year)
		- asymptomatic moderate to severe already going for CABG 
	- Relative indication 
		- abnormal treadmill test 
		- rapid progress of AS 
		- very severe AS -- jet velocity >5m/s or gradient >60mmHg 
		- excess LVH without systemic Hypertension 
	- Long-term postoperative survival correlates with preoperative LV function
	- adequacy of hepatic, renal, and pulmonary function before AVR is recommended 
	- Biological valve 
		- in >65years 
		- limited durability 
		- needs re-replacement 
	- Mechanical 
		- younger 
		- more PTE and bleeding risk 
	- Homograft AVR -- IE patients 
	- Ross procedure 
		- replacement of the diseased aortic valve with the autologous pulmonic valve and implantation of a homograft in the native pulmonic position 
		- young or middle aged 
		- aortic root dilation , AR and pulmonary homograft stenosis are complication 
- PAVR - PERCUTANEOUS AORTIC BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY
	- in children and young adult 
	- congenital noncalcific AS 
	- high restenosis rate in severe calcific AS 
	- maybe used to bridge to operation or TAVI in LV dysfunction or shock 
- TAVI - TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE IMPLANTATION 
	- across full spectrum of patient 
	- balloon- expandable valve or a self-expanding valve, both of which incorporate a **pericardial bioprosthesis**

# TRICUSPID STENOSIS

- Much less prevalent than mitral stenosis (MS) in North America and Western Europe.
- Generally **rheumatic in origin**.
- More common in **women**.
- Does not occur as an isolated lesion; usually associated with MS.
- Hemodynamically significant TS occurs in **5–10% of patients with severe MS**.
- Rheumatic TS is commonly associated with some degree of tricuspid regurgitation (TR).
- Nonrheumatic causes of TS are rare.

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

- Defined by a **diastolic pressure gradient between the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV)**.
- Gradient is **augmented during inspiration** and declines during expiration.
- A **mean diastolic pressure gradient of 4 mmHg** is usually sufficient to elevate the mean RA pressure.
- Elevated mean RA pressure results in **systemic venous congestion**.
- Venous congestion is associated with **hepatomegaly, ascites, and edema**.
- In patients with sinus rhythm, the **RA a wave may be extremely tall**.
- The **y descent is prolonged**.
- The cardiac output (CO) at rest is usually **depressed** and fails to rise during exercise.
- Low CO is responsible for normal or only slightly elevated left atrial (LA), pulmonary artery (PA), and RV systolic pressures despite associated MS.
- **TS can mask the hemodynamic and clinical features of any associated MS**.

## SYMPTOMS

- Many patients initially have symptoms of pulmonary congestion and fatigue due to the preceding MS.
- Patients with severe TS complain of relatively **little dyspnea** for the degree of hepatomegaly, ascites, and edema they have.
- Common symptoms include **fatigue** (secondary to low CO) and **discomfort** due to refractory edema, ascites, and marked hepatomegaly.
- TS may be suspected when symptoms of **right-sided failure persist after an adequate mitral commissurotomy**.

## PHYSICAL FINDINGS

- Diagnosis may be missed unless considered due to presence of other obvious valvular disease.
- Severe TS is associated with **marked hepatic congestion** often results in cirrhosis, jaundice, serious malnutrition, anasarca, and ascites.
- **Congestive hepatomegaly** is present.
- Splenomegaly may be present in cases of severe tricuspid valve disease.
- The **jugular veins are distended**.
- In patients with sinus rhythm, there may be **giant a waves** in jugular veins.
- The **v waves are less conspicuous**.
- There is a **slow y descent** because tricuspid obstruction impedes RA emptying during diastole.
- In patients with sinus rhythm, there may be **prominent presystolic pulsations of the enlarged liver**.
- On auscultation, a tricuspid valve opening snap (OS) may rarely be heard **∼0.06 s after pulmonic valve closure**.
- The diastolic murmur of TS has qualities similar to the MS murmur.
- The murmur may be missed as TS almost always occurs with MS.
- Heard best along the **left lower sternal border and over the xiphoid process**.
- Most prominent during **presystole** in patients with sinus rhythm.
- The murmur of TS is **augmented during inspiration**.
- Murmur is **reduced during expiration** and particularly during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.

## LABORATORY EXAMINATION

- Electrocardiogram (ECG) features of RA enlargement include **tall, peaked P waves in lead II**, and **prominent, upright P waves in lead V1**.
- **Absence of ECG evidence of RV hypertrophy (RVH)** in a patient with right-sided heart failure suspected of having MS should suggest associated tricuspid valve disease.
- Chest x-ray (combined TS and MS) shows particular **prominence of the RA and superior vena cava**.
- Less enlargement of the PA and less pulmonary vascular congestion compared to isolated MS.
- **Engorgement of the azygos vein** can often be appreciated.
- On transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) examination, the tricuspid valve is usually thickened and domes in diastole.
- The transvalvular gradient can be estimated by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography.
- **Severe TS** is characterized by a valve area **≤1 cm²** or pressure half-time of **≥190 ms**.
- The **RA and inferior vena cava (IVC) are enlarged**.
- TTE provides information on associated TR, mitral valve function, LV/RV size/function, and PA pressure.
- Cardiac catheterization is not routinely necessary for assessment of TS.

## TREATMENT

- Patients generally exhibit marked systemic venous congestion.
- Preoperative period requires **salt restriction, bed rest, and diuretic therapy**.
- Preparatory period may diminish hepatic congestion and improve hepatic function to reduce surgical risks (particularly bleeding).
- **Surgical relief of TS should be carried out**.
- Timing: Preferably at the time of surgical mitral commissurotomy or mitral valve replacement (MVR) for mitral valve disease.
- Indication: Moderate or severe TS in patients with **mean diastolic pressure gradients exceeding ∼4 mmHg** and **tricuspid orifice areas <1.5–2 cm²**.
- TS is almost always accompanied by significant TR.
- **Operative repair** may permit substantial improvement of tricuspid valve function.
- If repair cannot be accomplished, the tricuspid valve may have to be replaced.
- Meta-analysis shows no difference in overall survival between mechanical and tissue valve replacement.
- **Mechanical valves in the tricuspid position are more prone to thromboembolic complications**.
- Percutaneous tricuspid balloon commissurotomy for isolated severe TS without significant TR is very rarely performed.

# TRICUSPID REGURGITATION

- More than **85% of TR cases are secondary (functional)** in nature.
- Secondary TR related to tricuspid annular dilation and leaflet tethering in the setting of RV remodeling.
- RV remodeling caused by pressure or volume overload, myocardial infarction (MI), or trauma.
- Commonly seen in late stages of heart failure (rheumatic or congenital) with **severe PA hypertension (>55 mmHg PA systolic pressure)**.
- Also seen in other left-sided valvular (e.g., mitral regurgitation) or myocardial diseases (e.g., ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies).
- Secondary TR can develop from **chronic RV apical pacing** and dyssynchronous contraction.
- RV leads may perforate or entrap TV leaflets.
- TR can emerge with **new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF)**, particularly in older patients (atrial functional TR).
- **Primary TR** causes:
    - Rheumatic fever (often associated with TS).
    - Tricuspid valve prolapse.
    - Carcinoid heart disease.
    - Endomyocardial fibrosis.
    - Radiation.
    - Infective endocarditis.
    - Leaflet trauma.
    - Congenitally deformed tricuspid valves (less common).
    - Congenital defects: atrioventricular canal defects, Ebstein’s malformation.

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

- Incompetent tricuspid valve allows **backward flow from RV into RA**.
- Volume of backward flow depends on RV systolic pressure (driving pressure) and size of regurgitant orifice.
- Severity and physical signs vary with PA systolic pressure (if no RV outflow tract stenosis), tricuspid valve annulus dimension, respiratory cycle-dependent RV preload, and RA compliance.
- RV filling is increased during inspiration.
- **Forward CO is reduced** and does not augment with exercise.
- Significant TR leads to **RA enlargement** and elevation of RA and jugular venous pressures.
- **Prominent c-v waves** in the pulse tracings.
- Progressively severe TR can lead to **"ventricularization" of the RA wave form**.
- Severe TR is characterized by **RV dilation (RV volume overload)** and eventual **systolic dysfunction**.
- Progression of RV dysfunction can be accelerated by concomitant pressure load (PA hypertension) or myocardial fibrosis (previous injury).

## SYMPTOMS

- Mild or moderate degrees of TR are usually well tolerated if no other hemodynamic disturbances.
- Symptoms related to coexisting left-sided valve lesions, LV dysfunction, and/or PA hypertension may dominate the clinical picture.
- Early symptoms of isolated, severe TR: **fatigue** and **exertional dyspnea** (owing to reduced forward CO).
- As disease progresses and RV function declines, patients may report **cervical pulsations**, **abdominal fullness/bloating**, **diminished appetite**, and **muscle wasting** (despite progressive weight gain), and **painful swelling of the lower extremities**.

## PHYSICAL FINDINGS

- The **neck veins are distended** with **prominent c-v waves** and **rapid y descents** (in absence of TS).
- TR is more often diagnosed by examination of the neck veins than by auscultation.
- Other findings: **marked hepatomegaly with systolic pulsations**, ascites, pleural effusions, edema.
- **Positive hepatojugular reflux sign**.
- A **prominent RV pulsation** in the left parasternal region.
- A **blowing holosystolic murmur** along the lower left sternal margin.
- Murmur may be **intensified during inspiration (Carvallo’s sign)**.
- Murmur is **reduced during expiration or the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver**.
- Murmur sometimes confused with mitral regurgitation (MR) (distinguish by respiratory variation and RV enlargement).
- **AF is usually present** in the chronic phase.

## LABORATORY EXAMINATION

- ECG may show changes characteristic of the responsible lesion (e.g., inferior Q-wave MI, RVH, bizarre RBBB-type pattern with preexcitation in Ebstein’s anomaly).
- In patients with sinus rhythm, ECG signs of RA enlargement may be present.
- **AF is frequently noted**.
- Chest x-ray may show **RA and RV enlargement** (depending on chronicity and severity).
- TTE is usually definitive: demonstration of **RA dilation** and **RV volume overload**.
- TTE shows prolapsing, flail, scarred, or displaced/tethered tricuspid leaflets with annular dilatation.
- Diagnosis and assessment by **color flow Doppler imaging**.
- **Severe TR is accompanied by hepatic vein systolic flow reversal**.
- Continuous wave Doppler of TR velocity profile useful in estimating PA systolic pressure (except when severe TR blunts jet).
- Accurate TTE assessment of TR severity, PA pressures, and RV size/function can be challenging.
- Alternative imaging modalities: Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (not widely available).
- In patients with severe TR, the **CO is usually markedly reduced**.
- RA pressure pulse may not exhibit an x descent, but show a **prominent c-v wave with a rapid y descent**.
- Mean RA and RV end-diastolic pressures are often elevated.
- **Exercise testing** can assess functional capacity in asymptomatic severe TR.
- Prognostic significance of exercise-induced changes in TR severity and RV function has not been well studied.

## TREATMENT

- **Diuretics** can be useful for patients with severe TR and signs of right heart failure.
- An **aldosterone antagonist** may be particularly helpful (due to secondary hyperaldosteronism from hepatic congestion).
- Therapies to reduce elevated PA pressures and/or pulmonary vascular resistance (including for left-sided heart disease) can be considered for PA hypertension and severe secondary TR.
- **Tricuspid valve surgery is recommended** for patients with **severe TR who are undergoing left-sided valve surgery**.
- Undertaken frequently for even moderate TR in patients undergoing left-sided valve surgery who have **tricuspid annular dilation** (>40 mm TTE, >21 mm/m² TTE, or >70 mm intraoperative).
- Also for moderate TR during left-sided surgery with a history of right heart failure or PA hypertension.
- Operation most often comprises **repair rather than replacement** in these settings.
- Repair has become routine in most major surgical centers.
- Surgery may infrequently be required for **severe, primary TR** with right heart failure unresponsive to standard medical therapy or because of progressively declining RV systolic function.
- Reported **perioperative mortality rates for isolated tricuspid valve surgery are high (~8–9%)**.
- High mortality likely influenced by hazards during reoperation and reduced RV function.
- Indwelling pacemaker or defibrillator leads can pose technical challenges.
- Investigation of transcatheter tricuspid valve repair and replacement systems is ongoing

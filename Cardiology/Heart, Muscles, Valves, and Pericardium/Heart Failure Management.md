- Even with effective therapy, patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF are at risk for clinical deterioration, typically as a consequence of progressive sodium and fluid retention that fuels the development of congestive symptoms and acute decompensated HF (ADHF) 
- Recurrent episodes of ADHF despite careful longitudinal follow-up and effective treatment may signal the onset of an advanced or refractory HF phenotype (ACC/AHA stage D) in which the risk of mortality from sudden death or end-stage HF is high, and consideration of salvage therapies including cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support may be appropriate prior to escalation of palliative measures 
# HFpEF 
## General 
- No definite pharmacologic agent has shown effectiveness 
- focus on improving symptoms and effort tolerance by 
	- lifestyle modification 
	- control congestion 
	- stabilisation of heart rhythm 
	- control of BP to guideline 
	- MANAGEMENT of COMORBIDITIES 
		- obesity 
		- OSA 
		- OAD 
		- DM 
		- insulin resistance 
		- anemia 
		- CKD 
## Clinical Trials 
- CHARM -- Candesartan in Heart FAILURE 
	- Candesartan (ARB) showed reduced HF hospitalization but **no difference in all-cause mortality**  
- I-PRESERVE - Irbesartan in Heart Failure with Preserved Systolic Function 
	- no differences in the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization during treatment with the ARB irbesartan compared with placebo. 
- PEP-CHF -- Perindopril in Elderly People with Chronic Heart Failure 
	- early on showed benefit 
	- long-term no benefit 
- DIG(Digitalis Investigation Group) Ancillary Trial 
	- no impact of digoxin on all-cause mortality or on all-cause or cardiovascular hospitalization among patients with chronic HF, ejection fraction (EF) >45%, and sinus rhythm, although a **modest reduction in HF hospitalizations was noted** 
- SENIORS - Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalization in Seniors with Heart Failure
	- nebivolol - vasodilator beta blocker 
	- no significant reduction in all cause or cardiovascular mortality 
- TOPCAT -- Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist 
	- Spironolactone vs Placebo 
	- no improvement in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, HF hospitalizations, or aborted cardiac arrest but 
	- **reduction in HF hospitalizations among those allocated to spironolactone** 
	- some differences seen in regional results 
	- weak recommendation for spironolactone in patients with HFpEF who meet the inclusion criteria for the TOPCAT trial and are at low risk for adverse effects, including hyperkalemia and worsening renal function 
- ALDO-DHF - Aldosterone Receptor Blockade in Diastolic Heart Failure
	- **spironolactone improved echocardiographic indices of diastolic dysfunction** but failed to improve exercise capacity, symptoms, or quality-of-life (QOL) measures
- Ongoing trials 
	- SPIRRIT-HFpEF 
		- Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
	- FINE-ARTS-HF 
		- randomized Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone on Morbidity and Mortality in Participants with Heart Failure and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Greater than or Equal to 40%
## Novel Targets 
- microvascular endothelial inflammation driven by comorbidities that results in impaired nitric oxide (NO) signaling and associated increases in myocardial stiffening 
- phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor **sildenafil** improved filling pressures and right ventricular function in a cohort of **HFpEF patients with pulmonary venous hypertension**
	- but RELAX trial phase 2 (Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibition to Improve Clinical Status and Exercise Capacity in Diastolic Heart Failure) did **not show any improvement**  
- NEAT-HFpEF - Nitrate’s Effect on Activity Tolerance in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction 
	- Isosorbide mononitrate did not improve QOL or submaximal exercise capacity and decreased overall activity levels in treated patients 
- INDIE-HFpEF - Nitrite Delivery to Improve Exercise Capacity in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
	- Inorganic nitrate compounds have also been shown to enhance NO signaling but did not improve functional capacity compared to placebo
- PARAGON-HF 
	- symptomatic HFpEF (LVEF ≥45%), elevated natriuretic peptides, and structural heart disease to treatment with either **sacubitril-valsartan or valsartan** with the novel composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death and total hospitalizations for HF
	- **13% reduction in the rate of the primary composite endpoint in those allocated to sacubitril-valsartan**, this result narrowly missed the margin for statistical significance in the primary statistical analysis (p = .06)
	- **sacubitril-valsartan has recently been approved in the United States for treatment of symptomatic heart failure across the full spectrum of ejection fraction** 
- SGLT2 inhibitors 
	- dapagliflozin to guideline-directed medical therapy of HFrEF was associated with reductions in cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalization among patients with and without diabetes enrolled in the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) 
	- Ongoing trials 
		- DELIVER for Dapa 
		- EMPEROR-PRESERVED for empagliflozin 
## Clinical Principal 
- focus on decongestion, aggressive management of medical comorbidities, and relief of exacerbating factors 
- HfPEF is s heterogenous group that includes patients with 
	- infiltrative heart disease (amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis), 
	- storage disease (Fabry’s disease, Gaucher’s disease), 
	- hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
	- pericardial disease, 
	- pulmonary arterial hypertension, 
	- valvular heart disease, and 
	- primary right ventricular failure
- aggressive control of blood pressure to guideline-recommended targets and relief of volume overload with diuretics are critical to symptom relief 
- at risk for coronary heart disease --> deliberate evaluation for ischemia and consideration of coronary revascularization is important
- in the setting of atrial fibrillation, aggressive rate control, anticoagulation, and early consideration of sinus rhythm restoration

# Acute Decompensated HF
## General Principle 
- Interrelated decreased cardiac performance, renal dysfunction, and alterations in vascular compliance
- high mortality and morbidity --> 50% have readmission in 6-month 
- combined incidence of cardiovascular deaths, HF hospitalizations, myocardial infarction, strokes, or sudden death reaching 50% at 12 months after hospitalization 
- identify and address the factors that precipitated decompensation
	- non-adherence to medication 
	- dietary salt indiscretion 
	- medication -- NSAIDs, thiazolidinediones , TNF-inhibitors, antidepressants , onco therapy , cold/flu preparations with cardiac stimulant , herbals 
	- Coronary Ischemia 
	- Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias 
	- Valvular heart disease
	- systemic infection 
	- PTE 
- Pharmacologic Therapy 
	- relief of congestion, reduction in afterload, and maximization of vital organ perfusion 
	- Pulmonary artery catheter routinely not recommend -- use in low output HF, cardiogenic shock or those resistant to diuretics , those with combined cardiorenal dysfunction, known or suspected pulmonary artery hypertension 
- Worse outcome 
	- BUN >43mg/dl 
	- SBP<115mmhg 
	- Creatinine  -- >2.75uL 
- ![[ADHFmanagement.png]]
## Volume Management 
- IV Diuretc 
	- essential when oral drug absorption is impaired 
	- continuous infusion --> reduce toxicity and maintain stable serum drug levels
	- if resistant to loops --> thiazide diuretic like chlorothiazide or metolazone --> sequential nephron blockade may enhance natriuresis and facilitate decongestion --> increases the risk of significant hypokalemia
	- weight loss during hospitalization does not necessarily correlate closely with outcomes 
	- response --> improvement in clinical symptoms as well as the bedside examination documenting normalization of the jugular venous pressure, clearance of pulmonary rales, suppression of cardiac gallops, and resolution of peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and abdominal ascites. 
	- continue diuresis until euvolemia has been achieved
	- predischarge NT-proBNP correlate with risk of mortality and readmission 
- Cardiorenal Syndrome 
	- deteriorating function of one organ while therapy is administered to preserve the other.
	- most patients with cardiorenal syndrome demonstrate a preserved cardiac output 
	- exacerbated by “backward failure” resulting from increased intraabdominal pressure and impairment in return of renal venous blood flow
	- Continued use of diuretic therapy may be associated with a reduction in glomerular filtration rate and a worsening of the cardiorenal syndrome
	- late stages of disease characterized by profound low cardiac output state, inotropic therapy or mechanical circulatory support has been shown to preserve or improve renal function
- Ultrafiltration 
	- invasive fluid removal technique that may supplement the need for diuretic therapy.
	- Benefit 
		- controlled fluid removal 
		- neutral on electrolyte 
		- decreased neurohumoral activity 
	- aka Aquapharesis 
	- CARRESS-HF trial 
		- similar weight loss with UF 
		- more rise in creatinine  with UF 
	- complicates 
		- kidney failure 
		- bleeding 
		- IV catheter related complication 
## Vasoactive therapy 
- intravenous nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, and nesiritide (a recombinant brain-type natriuretic peptide) 
- lower intracardiac filling pressures and reduce systemic vascular tone 
- effective in providing symptom relief in patients with pulmonary edema and in restoring end-organ perfusion for those with low cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance 
- Nitroglycerine --> venous tone and ventricular preload
- sodium nitroprusside - potent arterial and venous vasodilator --> both preload and afterload
-

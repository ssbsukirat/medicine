- Even with effective therapy, patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF are at risk for clinical deterioration, typically as a consequence of progressive sodium and fluid retention that fuels the development of congestive symptoms and acute decompensated HF (ADHF) 
- Recurrent episodes of ADHF despite careful longitudinal follow-up and effective treatment may signal the onset of an advanced or refractory HF phenotype (ACC/AHA stage D) in which the risk of mortality from sudden death or end-stage HF is high, and consideration of salvage therapies including cardiac transplant or mechanical circulatory support may be appropriate prior to escalation of palliative measures 
# HFpEF 
## General 
- No definite pharmacologic agent has shown effectiveness 
- focus on improving symptoms and effort tolerance by 
	- lifestyle modification 
	- control congestion 
	- stabilisation of heart rhythm 
	- control of BP to guideline 
	- MANAGEMENT of COMORBIDITIES 
		- obesity 
		- OSA 
		- OAD 
		- DM 
		- insulin resistance 
		- anemia 
		- CKD 
## Clinical Trials 
- CHARM -- Candesartan in Heart FAILURE 
	- Candesartan (ARB) showed reduced HF hospitalization but **no difference in all-cause mortality**  
- I-PRESERVE - Irbesartan in Heart Failure with Preserved Systolic Function 
	- no differences in the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization during treatment with the ARB irbesartan compared with placebo. 
- PEP-CHF -- Perindopril in Elderly People with Chronic Heart Failure 
	- early on showed benefit 
	- long-term no benefit 
- DIG(Digitalis Investigation Group) Ancillary Trial 
	- no impact of digoxin on all-cause mortality or on all-cause or cardiovascular hospitalization among patients with chronic HF, ejection fraction (EF) >45%, and sinus rhythm, although a **modest reduction in HF hospitalizations was noted** 
- SENIORS - Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalization in Seniors with Heart Failure
	- nebivolol - vasodilator beta blocker 
	- no significant reduction in all cause or cardiovascular mortality 
- TOPCAT -- Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist 
	-

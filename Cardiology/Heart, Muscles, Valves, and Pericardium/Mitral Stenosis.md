# ETIOLOGY and Pathology 
- Rheumatic fever mc cause --> 40% of all patient with RHD 
	- diffuse thickening of valve leaflet secondary to chronic inflammation & formation of fibrous tissue 
	- mitral commisures fuse --> cusps rigid --> narrowing at apex of funnel shaped valve (fish-mouth) 
	- calcification --> immobilizes the leaflets and narrows the orifice further
- Others 
	- congenital stenosis 
	- cor triatriatum 
	- Mitral Annular Calcification with extension onto leaflet 
	- SLE 
	- RA 
	- LA myxoma 
	- IE with large vegetation

# Pathophysiology 
- normal mitral orifice -- 4-6cm2 
- significant obstruction --> <~2cm2 --> LA to LV needs **abnormal high left atrioventricular gradient**  
- severe MS --> <1.5cm2 --> LA pressure ~25mmhg needed to maintain CO 
- elevated pulmonary venous and pulmonary arterial (PA) wedge pressures --> reduce pulmonary compliance --> **exertional dyspnea** 
- dyspnea initially precipitate by events that increase rate of flow across mitral orifice --> further LA pressure elevation 
- to assess severity --> both gradient and flow rate to be measured --> flow rate CO and HR dependent 
- higher HR --> diastolic prolongation > systolic --> reduced time for flow across MV
- at a given CO --> higher HR --> higher transvalvular gradient and LA pressure 
- LVDP and EF normal in isolated MS 
- MS + sinus rhythm --> high LA and PA wedge pressure --> **prominent a wave and gradual pressure decline after the v wave and mitral valve opening (y descent)** 
- severe MS --> PA pressure elevation at rest and exercise --> secondary RVEDP elevation 
- Cardiac Output 
	- normal at rest even in severe MS 
	- subnormal rise on exercise 
	- very severe --> <1cm2 --> subnormal at rest, may fall during activity 
- Pulmonary Hypertension 
	- d/t 
		- passive backward transmission of LA pressure 
		- Pulmonary arteriolar constriction --> **second stenosis** 
		- interstitial edema in walls of small pulmonary vessels 
		- organic obliterative changes in pulmonary vascular bed 
# Symptoms 
- rheumatic carditis --> symptoms of MS --> ~2 decades 
- mostly disability in 4th decade of life 
- MS became seriously symptomatic, the disease progressed inexorably to death within 2â€“5 years. 
- if orifice large to maintain flow with mild elevation of LA pressure --> high pressure causes dyspnea and cough --> precipitate by 
	- sudden changes in the heart rate,
	- volume status, or CO, 
	- as, for example, with severe exertion, 
	- excitement, 
	- fever, 
	- severe anemia, 
	- paroxysmal AF and other tachycardias, 
	- sexual intercourse, 
	- pregnancy, and 
	- thyrotoxicosis
- with progressive --> lesser degrees of stress precipitate dyspnea, the patient becomes limited in daily activities, and orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea develop
- persistent AF --> accelerated rate of symptoms progress 
- Hemoptysis --> rupture of pulmonary-bronchial venous connections secondary to pulmonary venous hypertension 
	- more in patient with high LA pressure but normal pulmonary vascular resistance 
	- rarely fatal 
- Recurrent Pulmonary emboli +/- infarcts --> late in course, cause mortality and morbidity 
- Pulmonary infection in winters in untreated MS 
	- bronchitis 
	- Bronchopneumonia 
	- lobar pneumonia 
## Pulmonary Changes 
- fibrous thickening of walls of alveoli and pulmonary capillaries 
- VC, Total lung capacity , maximal breathing capacity and O2 uptake per unit ventilation all reduced 
- in exercise --> pulmonary capillary pressure increase --> compliance falls 
## Thrombi and Emboli 
- in LA , especially enlarged atrial appendages 
- systemic embolisation 10-20%, more in 
	- AF , 
	- 65 years 
	- reduced CO
- maybe presenting feature in mild MS 
# Physical Finding 
- Inspection / Palpation 
	- Severe MS -- malar flush with pinched and blue facies 
	- sinus rhythm + severe PAH/ TS --> prominent a wave in JVP 
	- BP normal or slightly low 
	- parasternal life --> enlarged RV 
	- Diastolic thrill in cardiac apex -- in left lateral recumbent 
- Auscultation 
	- S1 accentuated and delayed in early disease 
	- P2 accentuated in high PAPs 
	- S2 narrow split 
	- Opening Snap -- audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex 
	- OS after A2 0.05-0.12s 
	- OS f/b rumbling diastolic murmur at apex in left lateral recumbent --> accentuated by exercise just before auscultation 
		- intensity of MS related to duration of murmur 
		- in sinus rhythm --> presystolic accentuation (louder during atrial systole)
	- Soft, grade I or II/VI systolic murmurs --> at or medial to the apex --> s/o mitral valve disease with regurgitation
	- hepatomegaly , ankle edema, ascites, pleural effusion in MS + RV failure 
- Associated Lesions 
	- severe PH --> pansystolic murmur of functional TR in left sternal border 
		- louder during inspiration 
		- diminished during forced expiration --> **Carvallos Sign**
	- in reduced CO state --> murmur may not be appreciable --> silent MS 
	- Graham Steell murmur of PR,
		- high-pitched, diastolic, decrescendo blowing murmur along the left sternal border, 
		- d/t dilation of the pulmonary valve ring in mitral valve disease and severe pulmonary hypertension. 
		- may be indistinguishable from the more common murmur produced by aortic regurgitation (AR) 
		- it may increase in intensity with inspiration and is accompanied by a loud and often palpable P2.
# LABORATORY 
- ECG 
	- P wave s/o LA enlargement 
		- tall and peaked in lead II and upright in lead V1 when severe pulmonary hypertension or TS complicates MS and right atrial (RA) enlargement develops
	- QRS normal 
	- RAD and RVH in severe PH 
- Echocardiogram 
	- Provides 
		- measurements of mitral inflow velocity during early (E wave) and late (A wave in patients in sinus rhythm) diastolic filling, 
		- transvalvular peak and mean gradients and mitral orifice area, 
		- presence and severity of any associated MR,
		- extent of leaflet calcification and restriction, 
		- the degree of distortion of the subvalvular apparatus 
		- anatomic suitability for percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy
	- TEE if TTE in inadequate 
	- TEE to exclude LA thrombus before PMBC
- Chest Xray 
	- early 
		- straightening of upper left border of cardiac silhouette, 
		- prominent PAs,
		- dilation of upper lobe pulmonary veins, 
		- posterior displacement of esophagus by enlarged LA
	- Kerley B lines --> fine, dense, opaque, horizontal lines in lower, mid-lung fields --> d/t distension of interlobular septae and lymphatics with edema ---> when LA pressure >20mmHg 
# DIFFERENTIAL 
- significant MR may have diastolic murmur 
	- but in isolated MR --> starts later than MS murmur and have evidence of LVH 
	- OS and increased P2 absent 
	- S1 soft or absent 
	- apical pansystolic murmur of at least grade III/VI intensity as well as an S3 suggests significant MR.
- severe AR 
	- apical mid-diastolic murmur associated with severe AR (Austin Flint murmur) may be mistaken for MS 
	- differentiated from it because it is not intensified in pre-systole and becomes softer with administration of amyl nitrite or other arterial vasodilators
- TS masks MS finding 
- ASD 
	- clinical, ECG, and chest x-ray evidence of RV enlargement and accentuation of pulmonary vascularity 
	- absence of LA enlargement and of Kerley B lines and the demonstration of fixed splitting of S2 with a grade II or III mid-systolic murmur at the mid to upper left sternal border all favor atrial septal defect over MS
- LA Myxoma 
	- obstruct LA emptying , dyspnea , diastolic murmur and hemodynamic changes similar to MS 
	- f/s/o systemic disease 
		- weight loss 
		- fever 
		- anemia 
		- systemic emboli 
		- high IgG, IL-6 levels 
# CardiaC Catheterization 
- discrepancy between the clinical and noninvasive findings, including those from TEE and exercise echocardiographic testing when appropriate.
- helpful in assessing associated lesions, such as AS and AR, and in patients with recurring or worsening symptoms later after mitral valve intervention. 
- CT angiography maybe used 
# Treatment 
- ![[MStreatment.png]]
- in rheumatic --> Penicllin prophylaxis for gpA beta-hemolytic streptococci 
- IE prophylaxis --> patients at high risk for complications from infection, including patients with a history of endocarditis
- symptomatic --> restriction of sodium intake and small doses of oral diuretics
- Beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil or diltiazem), and digitalis glycosides are useful in slowing the ventricular rate of patients with AF. 
- MS + AF/ thromboembolism or LA thrombus --> vit K antagonist like warfarin --> INR 2-3 lifelong

# ETIOLOGY and Pathology 
- Rheumatic fever mc cause --> 40% of all patient with RHD 
	- diffuse thickening of valve leaflet secondary to chronic inflammation & formation of fibrous tissue 
	- mitral commisures fuse --> cusps rigid --> narrowing at apex of funnel shaped valve (fish-mouth) 
	- calcification --> immobilizes the leaflets and narrows the orifice further
- Others 
	- congenital stenosis 
	- cor triatriatum 
	- Mitral Annular Calcification with extension onto leaflet 
	- SLE 
	- RA 
	- LA myxoma 
	- IE with large vegetation

# ETIOLOGY and Pathology 
- Rheumatic fever mc cause --> 40% of all patient with RHD 
	- diffuse thickening of valve leaflet secondary to chronic inflammation & formation of fibrous tissue 
	- mitral commisures fuse --> cusps rigid --> narrowing at apex of funnel shaped valve (fish-mouth) 
	- calcification --> immobilizes the leaflets and narrows the orifice further
- Others 
	- congenital stenosis 
	- cor triatriatum 
	- Mitral Annular Calcification with extension onto leaflet 
	- SLE 
	- RA 
	- LA myxoma 
	- IE with large vegetation

# Pathophysiology 
- normal mitral orifice -- 4-6cm2 
- significant obstruction --> <~2cm2 --> LA to LV needs **abnormal high left atrioventricular gradient**  
- severe MS --> <1.5cm2 --> LA pressure ~25mmhg needed to maintain CO 
- elevated pulmonary venous and pulmonary arterial (PA) wedge pressures --> reduce pulmonary compliance --> **exertional dyspnea** 
- dyspnea initially precipitate by events that increase rate of flow across mitral orifice --> further LA pressure elevation 
- to assess severity --> both gradient and flow rate to be measured --> flow rate CO and HR dependent 
- higher HR --> diastolic prolongation > systolic --> reduced time for flow across MV
- at a given CO --> higher HR --> higher transvalvular gradient and LA pressure 
- LVDP and EF normal in isolated MS 
- MS + sinus rhythm --> high LA and PA wedge pressure --> **prominent a wave and gradual pressure decline after the v wave and mitral valve opening (y descent)** 
- severe MS --> PA pressure elevation at rest and exercise --> secondary RVEDP elevation 
- Cardiac Output 
	- normal at rest even in severe MS 
	- subnormal rise on exercise 
	- very severe --> <1cm2 --> subnormal at rest, may fall during activity 
- Pulmonary Hypertension 
	- d/t 
		- passive backward transmission of LA pressure 
		- Pulmonary arteriolar constriction --> **second stenosis** 
		- interstitial edema in walls of small pulmonary vessels 
		- organic obliterative changes in pulmonary vascular bed 
# Symptoms 
- rheumatic carditis --> symptoms of MS --> ~2 decades 
- mostly disability in 4th decade of life 
- MS became seriously symptomatic, the disease progressed inexorably to death within 2â€“5 years. 
- if orifice large to maintain flow with mild elevation of LA pressure --> high pressure causes dyspnea and cough --> precipitate by 
	- sudden changes in the heart rate,
	- volume status, or CO, 
	- as, for example, with severe exertion, 
	- excitement, 
	- fever, 
	- severe anemia, 
	- paroxysmal AF and other tachycardias, 
	- sexual intercourse, 
	- pregnancy, and 
	- thyrotoxicosis
- with progressive --> lesser degrees of stress precipitate dyspnea, the patient becomes limited in daily activities, and orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea develop
- persistent AF --> accelerated rate of symptoms progress 
- Hemoptysis --> rupture of pulmonary-bronchial venous connections secondary to pulmonary venous hypertension 
	- more in patient with high LA pressure but normal pulmonary vascular resistance 
	- rarely fatal 
- Recurrent Pulmonary emboli +/- infarcts --> late in course, cause mortality and morbidity 
- Pulmonary infection in winters in untreated MS 
	- bronchitis 
	- Bronchopneumonia 
	- lobar pneumonia 
# Pulmonary Changes 
- fibrous thickening of walls of alveoli and pulmonary capillaries 
- VC, Total lung capacity , maximal breathing capacity and O2 uptake per unit ventilation all reduce

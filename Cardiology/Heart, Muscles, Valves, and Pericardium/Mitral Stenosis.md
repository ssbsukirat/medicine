# ETIOLOGY and Pathology 
- Rheumatic fever mc cause --> 40% of all patient with RHD 
	- diffuse thickening of valve leaflet secondary to chronic inflammation & formation of fibrous tissue 
	- mitral commisures fuse --> cusps rigid --> narrowing at apex of funnel shaped valve (fish-mouth) 
	- calcification --> immobilizes the leaflets and narrows the orifice further
- Others 
	- congenital stenosis 
	- cor triatriatum 
	- Mitral Annular Calcification with extension onto leaflet 
	- SLE 
	- RA 
	- LA myxoma 
	- IE with large vegetation

# Pathophysiology 
- normal mitral orifice -- 4-6cm2 
- significant obstruction --> <~2cm2 --> LA to LV needs **abnormal high left atrioventricular gradient**  
- severe MS --> <1.5cm2 --> LA pressure ~25mmhg needed to maintain CO 
- elevated pulmonary venous and pulmonary arterial (PA) wedge pressures --> reduce pulmonary compliance --> **exertional dyspnea** 
- dyspnea initially precipitate by events that increase rate of flow across mitral orifice --> further LA pressure elevation 
- to assess severity --> both gradient and flow rate to be measured --> flow rate CO and HR dependent 
- higher HR --> diastolic prolongation > systolic --> reduced time for flow across MV
- at a given CO --> higher HR --> higher transvalvular gradient and LA pressure 
- LVDP and EF normal in isolated MS 
- MS + sinus rhythm --> high LA and PA wedge pressure --> **prominent a wave and gradual pressure decline after the v wave and mitral valve opening (y descent)** 
- severe MS --> PA pressure elevation at rest and exercise --> secondary RVEDP elevation 
- Cardiac Output

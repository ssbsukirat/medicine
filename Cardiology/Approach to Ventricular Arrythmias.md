# Types 
- Focal or reentrant circuits 
- Focal --> myocardial or Purkinje cells with automaticity or triggered activity 
- Reentrant --> scar tissue or cardiomyopathy
- conduction away from Ventricular focus / reentrant circuit --> slower than normal purkinje system activation --> wide WRS (>0.12s)
- PVCs / Premature Ventricular Contraction 
	- single ventricular beats earlier than anticipated supraventricular beat 
	- if from same focus --> same QRS --> unifocal 
	- different focus --> variable QRS -- Multifocal 
	- 2 consecutive VPCs --> Ventricular Couplets 
- VT/ Ventricular TACHYCARDIA 
	- 3 or more beats at rate >100/min 
	- terminate spontaneous <30s --> Nonsustained VT
	- >30s/ needs active intervention  -> sustained VT 
- Monomorphic VT
	- same QRS morphology 
	- if very rapid --> sinusoidal appearace --> **ventricular flutter** 
	- slow sinusoidal VTs have a wide QRS indicative of slowed ventricular conduction
		- Hyperkalemia, 
		- toxicity from excessive effects of drugs that block sodium channels (e.g., flecainide,propafenone, or tricyclic antidepressants),
		- severe global myocardial ischemia are possible causes
- initial site of activation determines sequence 
	- Arrhythmias that originate from the **right ventricle or septum** result in late activation of much of the left ventricle, thereby producing a **prominent S wave in V1 referred to as a left bundle branch block–like configuration**
	- free wall of the **left ventricle** have a prominent positive deflection in V1, thereby producing a **right bundle branch block–like morphology in V1**  
	- axis that is directed **inferiorly**, as indicated by dominant R waves in lead II, III, and AVF, suggests **initial activation of the cranial portion** of the ventricle
	- frontal plane axis that is directed **superiorly** (dominant S waves in II, III, and AVF) suggests **initial activation at the inferior wall.**
- Polymorphic VT 
	- changing QRS morphology 
	- changing activation sequence 
	- if congenital or acquired prolongation of the QT interval-->  waxing and waning QRS amplitude --> characteristic shifting axis referred to as **torsades des pointes after the classic ballet sequence**
- Idioventricular Rhythm 
	- 3 or more consecutive beats at slowet rate 
- Ventricular Fibrillation 
	- continuous irregular activation with no discrete QRS complexes 
	- monomorphic or polymorphic VT may transition to VF 
- idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia generally refers to PVCs or VT that occurs in patients with a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), without structural heart disease, and not associated with an underlying genetic syndrome or risk of sudden death

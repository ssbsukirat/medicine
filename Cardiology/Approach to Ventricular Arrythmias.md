# Types 
- Focal or reentrant circuits 
- Focal --> myocardial or Purkinje cells with automaticity or triggered activity 
- Reentrant --> scar tissue or cardiomyopathy
- conduction away from Ventricular focus / reentrant circuit --> slower than normal purkinje system activation --> wide WRS (>0.12s)
- PVCs / Premature Ventricular Contraction 
	- single ventricular beats earlier than anticipated supraventricular beat 
	- if from same focus --> same QRS --> unifocal 
	- different focus --> variable QRS -- Multifocal 
	- 2 consecutive VPCs --> Ventricular Couplets 
- VT/ Ventricular TACHYCARDIA 
	- 3 or more beats at rate >100/min 
	- terminate spontaneous <30s --> Nonsustained VT
	- >30s/ needs active intervention  -> sustained VT 
- Monomorphic VT
	- same QRS morphology 
	- if very rapid --> sinusoidal appearace --> **ventricular flutter** 
	- slow sinusoidal VTs have a wide QRS indicative of slowed ventricular conduction
		- Hyperkalemia, 
		- toxicity from excessive effects of drugs that block sodium channels (e.g., flecainide,propafenone, or tricyclic antidepressants),
		- severe global myocardial ischemia are possible causes
- initial site of activation determines sequence 
	- Arrhythmias that originate from the **right ventricle or septum** result in late activation of much of the left ventricle, thereby producing a **prominent S wave in V1 referred to as a left bundle branch block–like configuration**
	- free wall of the **left ventricle** have a prominent positive deflection in V1, thereby producing a **right bundle branch block–like morphology in V1**  
	- axis that is directed **inferiorly**, as indicated by dominant R waves in lead II, III, and AVF, suggests **initial activation of the cranial portion** of the ventricle
	- frontal plane axis that is directed **superiorly** (dominant S waves in II, III, and AVF) suggests **initial activation at the inferior wall.**
- Polymorphic VT 
	- changing QRS morphology 
	- changing activation sequence 
	- if congenital or acquired prolongation of the QT interval-->  waxing and waning QRS amplitude --> characteristic shifting axis referred to as **torsades des pointes after the classic ballet sequence**
- Idioventricular Rhythm 
	- 3 or more consecutive beats at slowet rate 
- Ventricular Fibrillation 
	- continuous irregular activation with no discrete QRS complexes 
	- monomorphic or polymorphic VT may transition to VF 
- idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia generally refers to PVCs or VT that occurs in patients with a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), without structural heart disease, and not associated with an underlying genetic syndrome or risk of sudden death 
# Clinical 
- symptoms 
	- palpitations, 
	- dizziness, 
	- exercise intolerance, 
	- episodes of lightheadedness, 
	- syncope, or 
	- sudden cardiac arrest leading to sudden death if not resuscitated
- **every other beat is a PVC (bigeminy)**, pulse measurements for heart rate can be erroneously low (**pseudobradycardia**) because the PVCs may not generate a separate pulse wave
- Syncope -- concerning 
	- more risk for cardiac arrest and sudden death if 
		- without prodrome 
		- during exercise 
		- setting of abnormal ECG or structural heart disease 
- sustained VT --> wide QRS tachycardia (differentiate from SVT with aberrancy) 
# Evaluation of PATIENT 
- diagnosis of VAs can be established by 
	- recording the arrhythmia on an ECG, 
	- by an ambulatory or implanted cardiac monitor, 
	- by an implanted rhythm management device such as a pacemaker or ICD, or 
	- in some cases, initiation of the arrhythmia during an electrophysiologic study.
- take h/o cardiac disease , drugs, precipitating factors 
- family h/o premature CAD, cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrhythmia 
- physical -->pulse, jugular venous pressure lung fields, and cardiac auscultation 
- Stigmata of neuromuscular disease or dysmorphic features may suggest a genetic arrhythmia syndrome. 
- ECG 
	- always done even if asymptomatic 
	- sometimes only VPCs seen 
	- benign idiopathic arrhythmia often have normal ECG 
	- Q waves prior MI 
	- Ventricular Hypertrophy 
	- ECG for long QT, short QT, Brugada 
- Cardiac imaging if suspicion of cardiac disease 
	- TTE --> depressed LV function --> increased SCD risk 
	- Ventricular thickening --> HOCM, amyloidosis 
	- Cardiac MRi with gadolinium --> scar seen as delayed hyperenhancement 
- exclude CAD in at-risk PATIENT 
# TREATMENT 
- some --> reassurance , remove aggravation factor like caffeine

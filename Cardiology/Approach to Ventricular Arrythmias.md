# Types 
- Focal or reentrant circuits 
- Focal --> myocardial or Purkinje cells with automaticity or triggered activity 
- Reentrant --> scar tissue or cardiomyopathy
- conduction away from Ventricular focus / reentrant circuit --> slower than normal purkinje system activation --> wide WRS (>0.12s)
- PVCs / Premature Ventricular Contraction 
	- single ventricular beats earlier than anticipated supraventricular beat

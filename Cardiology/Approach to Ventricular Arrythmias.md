# Types 
- Focal or reentrant circuits 
- Focal --> myocardial or Purkinje cells with automaticity or triggered activity 
- Reentrant --> scar tissue or cardiomyopathy
- conduction away from Ventricular focus / reentrant circuit --> slower than normal purkinje system activation --> wide WRS (>0.12s)
- PVCs / Premature Ventricular Contraction 
	- single ventricular beats earlier than anticipated supraventricular beat 
	- if from same focus --> same QRS --> unifocal 
	- different focus --> variable QRS -- Multifocal 
	- 2 consecutive VPCs --> Ventricular Couplets 
- VT/ Ventricular TACHYCARDIA 
	- 3 or more beats at rate >100/min 
	- terminate spontaneous <30s --> Nonsustained VT
	- >30s/ needs active intervention  -> sustained VT 
- Monomorphic VT
	- same QRS morphology 
	- if very rapid --> sinusoidal appearace --> **ventricular flutter** 
	- slow sinusoidal VTs have a wide QRS indicative of slowed ventricular conduction
		- Hyperkalemia, 
		- toxicity from excessive effects of drugs that block sodium channels (e.g., flecainide,propafenone, or tricyclic antidepressants),
		- severe global myocardial ischemia are possible causes
- initial site of activation determines sequence 
	- Arrhythmias that originate from the **right ventricle or septum** result in late activation of much of the left ventricle, thereby producing a **prominent S wave in V1 referred to as a left bundle branch block–like configuration**
	- free wall of the **left ventricle** have a prominent positive deflection in V1, thereby producing a **right bundle branch block–like morphology in V1**  
	- axis that is directed **inferiorly**, as indicated by dominant R waves in lead II, III, and AVF, suggests **initial activation of the cranial portion** of the ventricle
	- frontal plane axis that is directed **superiorly** (dominant S waves in II, III, and AVF) suggests **initial activation at the inferior wall.**
- Polymorphic VT 
	- changing QRS morphology 
	- changing activation sequence 
	- if congenital or acquired prolongation of the QT interval-->  waxing and waning QRS amplitude --> characteristic shifting axis referred to as **torsades des pointes after the classic ballet sequence**
- Idioventricular Rhythm 
	- 3 or more consecutive beats at slowet rate 
- Ventricular Fibrillation 
	- continuous irregular activation with no discrete QRS complexes 
	- monomorphic or polymorphic VT may transition to VF 
- idiopathic ventricular arrhythmia generally refers to PVCs or VT that occurs in patients with a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), without structural heart disease, and not associated with an underlying genetic syndrome or risk of sudden death 
# Clinical 
- symptoms 
	- palpitations, 
	- dizziness, 
	- exercise intolerance, 
	- episodes of lightheadedness, 
	- syncope, or 
	- sudden cardiac arrest leading to sudden death if not resuscitated
- **every other beat is a PVC (bigeminy)**, pulse measurements for heart rate can be erroneously low (**pseudobradycardia**) because the PVCs may not generate a separate pulse wave
- Syncope -- concerning 
	- more risk for cardiac arrest and sudden death if 
		- without prodrome 
		- during exercise 
		- setting of abnormal ECG or structural heart disease 
- sustained VT --> wide QRS tachycardia (differentiate from SVT with aberrancy) 
# Evaluation of PATIENT 
- diagnosis of VAs can be established by 
	- recording the arrhythmia on an ECG, 
	- by an ambulatory or implanted cardiac monitor, 
	- by an implanted rhythm management device such as a pacemaker or ICD, or 
	- in some cases, initiation of the arrhythmia during an electrophysiologic study.
- take h/o cardiac disease , drugs, precipitating factors 
- family h/o premature CAD, cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrhythmia 
- physical -->pulse, jugular venous pressure lung fields, and cardiac auscultation 
- Stigmata of neuromuscular disease or dysmorphic features may suggest a genetic arrhythmia syndrome. 
- ECG 
	- always done even if asymptomatic 
	- sometimes only VPCs seen 
	- benign idiopathic arrhythmia often have normal ECG 
	- Q waves prior MI 
	- Ventricular Hypertrophy 
	- ECG for long QT, short QT, Brugada 
- Cardiac imaging if suspicion of cardiac disease 
	- TTE --> depressed LV function --> increased SCD risk 
	- Ventricular thickening --> HOCM, amyloidosis 
	- Cardiac MRi with gadolinium --> scar seen as delayed hyperenhancement 
- exclude CAD in at-risk PATIENT 
# TREATMENT 
- some --> reassurance , remove aggravation factor like caffeine 
- if associated with a sudden death risk, **ICD implantation is usually indicated and will provide a “safety net”** to terminate life-threatening VT or VF, preventing sudden death but without preventing the arrhythmia
- supress -> antiarrhythmic therapy 
## Drugs 
- Adverse effects are mostly noncardiac and minor but can sometimes be severe enough to limit their use
- Cardiac side effects, however, include the potential for “proarrhythmia,” whereby a drug can increase the frequency of arrhythmia or cause a new arrhythmia
- may aggravate bradyarythmias 
- B blockers 
	- safe so 1st line in most 
	- for exercise induced arrhythmias , idiopathic arrhythmias 
	- limited use in arrhythmias d/t cardiac disease 
- CCBs 
	- effective for some idiopathic VTs 
	- risk of proarrhythmia is low, 
	- but they have negative inotropic and vasodilatory effects that can aggravate hypotension 
- [[Sodium]] Channel blocker 
	- include mexiletine, quinidine, disopyramide, flecainide, and propafenone, and are available for chronic oral therapy
	- Antiarrhythmic actions are the result of depressing cardiac conduction and membrane excitability. 
	- Conduction slowing can be manifest as a prolongation of QRS duration 
	- IV -- lidocaine , quinidine , procainamide 
	- Quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide also have potassium channel–blocking effects that prolong the QT interval (class III antiarrhythmic drug action 
	- have potential proarrhythmic effects and, with the possible exception of quinidine, also have negative inotropic effects --> increased mortality if given to PATIENT with prior MI 
	- avoid if structural heart disease 
	- used to reduce symptomatic arrhythmias in ICD patient 
- Potassium Channel Blockers 
	- Sotalol and dofetilide --> block the delayed rectifier potassium channel IKr --> prolonging action potential duration (QT interval) and the cardiac refractory period, known as the class III antiarrhythmic drug effect
	- sotalol also non-selective beta blockage --> modest reduction in ICD shocks 
	- Proarrhythmia due to the polymorphic VT torsade de pointe that is associated with QT prolongation --> 3-5% 
	- dose adjustment or avoidance in renal insufficiency 
	- avoid if TdP risk factor 
		- QT prolongation 
		- hypokalemia 
		- significant bradycardia 
- Amiodarone 
	- blocks multiple cardiac ionic currents and has sympatholytic activity. 
	- MOST Effective drugs for suppressing VAs 
	- IV for life threatening arrhythmias 
	- more effective than sotalol for ICD shock reduction 
	- major S/e bradyarythmias 
	- TdP rare 
	- Hyper- and hypothyroidism are related to the iodine content of the drug 
	- Pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis 
	- photosensitivity 
	- neuropathy 
	- ocular toxicity 
	- assess --> thyroid , liver and pulmonary toxicity regularly 
	- >24h IV infusion --> thrombophlebitis 
	- Dronedarone --> similar to amiodarone without Iodine but poor result in VAs 
- ICD - IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATORS
	- sustained VT, largely based on heart rate, and then terminate the arrhythmia
	- transvenous devices, VF is terminated by a shock applied between a lead in the right ventricle and the ICD pulse generator
	- lead can provide pacing for bradycardia if needed
	- transvenous --> s/e --> vascular occlusion, risk of lead fracture, endocarditis in the event of infection, and difficulty with removal 
	- ATP --> Monomorphic VT can also be terminated by a burst of rapid pacing faster than the VT, known as antitachycardia pacing (ATP) 
	- if ATP fai

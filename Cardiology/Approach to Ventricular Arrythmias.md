# Types 
- Focal or reentrant circuits 
- Focal --> myocardial or Purkinje cells with automaticity or triggered activity 
- Reentrant --> scar tissue or cardiomyopathy
- conduction away from Ventricular focus / reentrant circuit --> slower than normal purkinje system activation --> wide WRS (>0.12s)
- PVCs / Premature Ventricular Contraction 
	- single ventricular beats earlier than anticipated supraventricular beat 
	- if from same focus --> same QRS --> unifocal 
	- different focus --> variable QRS -- Multifocal 
	- 2 consecutive VPCs --> Ventricular Couplets 
- VT/ Ventricular TACHYCARDIA 
	- 3 or more beats at rate >100/min 
	- terminate spontaneous <30s --> Nonsustained VT
	- >30s/ needs active intervention  -> sustained VT 
- Monomorphic VT
	- same QRS morphology 
- initial site of activation determines sequence 
	- Arrhythmias that originate from the **right ventricle or septum** result in late activation of much of the left ventricle, thereby producing a **prominent S wave in V1 referred to as a left bundle branch blockâ€“like configuration**
	- 
- Idioventricular Rhythm 
	- 3 or more consecutive beats at slowet rate 
	-

- **Macroreentrant atrial tachycardia** is due to a large anatomic reentry circuit, often associated with areas of scar in the atria
# Common or typical right atrial flutter 
- is due to a circuit pathway around the tricuspid valve annulus, bounded anteriorly by the annulus and posteriorly by functional conduction block in the crista terminalis -->
- wavefront between IVC, tricuspid annulus (**sub-Eustachian or cavotricuspid isthmus** ) --> aka Cavotricuspid Isthmus-dependent Atrial Flutter --> can be catheter ablated 
- **counterclockwise** direction (as viewed looking toward the tricuspid annulus from the ventricular apex), which produces the characteristic **negative sawtooth flutter waves in leads II, III, and aVF and positive P waves in lead V1**
- atrial rate is typically 240â€“300 beats/min but may be slower in the presence of atrial disease or antiarrhythmic drugs --> conducted at 2:1 AV block --> 130-150/min tachycardia (P overlaps T)
- maneuver to increase AV block --> flutter wave exposed 
- a/w AF and atrial scar 
- Right sided cardiac or Pulmonary vascular disease --> predispose to common right atrial flutter 
- AF treated with flecanide, propafenone , amiodarone --> present as flutter 
# Atypical Atrial Tachycardia

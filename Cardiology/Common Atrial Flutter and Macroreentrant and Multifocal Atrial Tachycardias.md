- **Macroreentrant atrial tachycardia** is due to a large anatomic reentry circuit, often associated with areas of scar in the atria
- **Common or typical right atrial flutter** is due to a circuit pathway around the tricuspid valve annulus, bounded anteriorly by the annulus and posteriorly by functional conduction block in the crista terminalis --> wavefront between IVC, tricuspid annulus (**sub-Eustachian or cavotricuspid isthmus** ) --> aka Cavotricuspid Isthmus-dependent Atrial Flutter --> can be catheter ablated 
	- **counterclockwise** direction (as viewed looking toward the tricuspid annulus from the ventricular apex), which produces the characteristic **negative sawtooth flutter waves in leads II, III, and aVF and positive P waves in lead V1**

# Cellular Electrophysiology 
- cardiac action potential AP in 5 phases 0-4 
- phase 0 
	- rapid upstroke 
	- QRS 
	- Na current 
- phase 1-2 
	- ST segment 
	- 1 - activation of Ito with inactivation of the Na current
	- 2 - plateau , balance of repolarising K and depolarizing Ca currents 
- phase 3 
	- T wave 
	- deactivation of Ca and repolarisation by K (Ikr, Iks)
- phase 4 
	- end of T to start of QRS 
	- K current Ik1 
- P -- atrial depolarization 
- PR -- 
	- time between initiation of atrial depolarization to the initiation of ventricular depolarization
	- mainly conduction through AV node 
- Channels 
	- complex, multi-subunit transmembrane glycoproteins 
	- contains a central pore selective for ion species -- "gating" apparatus regulating the opening, closing, inactivation apparatus 
	- central pore 
		- P domain 
		- hydrophillic AA residues 
		- structural variants 
			- **four separate homologous alpha subunits**, each with homologous P domains (**voltage-gated K channels**)
			- **single alpha subunit** with four internally homologous P domains (**voltage-gated Na or Ca channels** 
			- **two internally homologous P domains from two separate subunits (most ligand- gated K channels)** 
	- voltage-gated channels 
		- 4th segment (of 6) -- S4 -- AAs function as voltage sensor --> cause changes in protein conformation --> gating 
	- Ligand-gated 
		- binding of a ligand (transmitters, molecules, or other ions) results in channel opening or closing, 
	- stretch-activated channels
		- deformations in membrane shape determine gating 
	- in many ion channels, a complex of **auxiliary proteins is associated with the primary alpha subunit**; most auxiliary subunits appear to **facilitate regulation of ion channel expression and activity.** 
	- Gap junction complex 
		- large multimeric complex of connexin subunits forms a large, nonselective pore that spans and thereby connects adjacent myocytes 
		- allows free flux of ions between adjacent myocytes, facilitating impulse propagation across myocardial tissues. 
- Na/Ca --> inward depolarising current 
- K --> outward repolarising current 
- Atrial/ ventricular myocytes 
	- Na --> phase1 of AP 
	- Na channel blockers -- treat tachyarrhythmia from atria and ventricles 
- nodal tissue --> Ca current --> slow phase 1 --> CCBs --> nodal tissue block 
- Funny current / If 
	- automaticity of sinus tissue --> gradual depolarization observed during phase 4, until a threshold is reached that initiates the next AP 
	- generated by a semiselective Na/Ca channel, termed the “funny current” or If, 
	- target for ivabradine.
# Normal Cardiac impulse Propagation 
- SA node --> RA -> LA --> atrial systole --> AV node --> relatively slow conduction --> bundle of His --> Right , Left bundle branches --> left anterio, left posterior fascicles --> Purkinje fibres (2-3m/s speed but in myocardial cells 0.3-0.4m/s)
# Mechanisms of cardiac Arrhythmia 
- Bradyarythmias from abnormalities in conduction tissues 
	- SA node - pathologic sinus bradycardia 
	- AV -- conduction block 
	- His-Purkinje system - conduction block 
- Tachyarrhythmia 
	- conduction tissues or even atria or ventricle 
	- **Enhanced Automaticity -- abnormal spontaneous depolarization**, which can occur along the conduction system, the atria, or ventricles
	- **Triggered arrhythmia -- abnormal afterdepolarizations** that occur in either **phase 2/3 (early afterdepolarizations)** or **phase 4 (delayed afterdepolarizations)** of the AP
	- ![[tachymechanism.png]]
## Enhanced Automaticity 
- Automaticity -- spontaneous depolarization in phase 4 of AP 
	- in SA, AV, His-Purkinje system 
	- SA- If (na/Ca) current of phase 4
	- others - K currents, Ca currents, or even the Na/Ca and ATP-driven Na/K exchangers contribute
- if proximal structure automaticity is unreliable --> **distal structure automaticity creates "escape rhythm"** to maintain CO 
- automaticity determined by rate of depolarization 
- nodal --> rate of depolarization determined by autonomic system 
	- Parasympathetic --> ACh --> GPCR mediated IKACh potassium channel complex --> K efflux --> hyperpolarisation --> slow phase 4 depolarization --> slow automaticity 
	- Sympathetic --> catecholamine mediated alpha and beta adrenergic receptor --> B-1 (L-type Ca channel) --> Ca influx --> enhanced depolarization --> increased automaticity 
- **intrinsic heart rate (IHR)** is defined as the “**native**” automaticity rate of the SA node, **absent any autonomic input.** 
- **Abnormally enhanced automaticity may occur at any site that exhibits automaticity**, including the SA node, AV node, or His- Purkinje system --> pathological tachycardia 
- other **stereotyped regions** in the heart may exhibit **enhanced automaticity,** including the **pulmonary veins, coronary sinus superior vena cava, and ventricular outflow tracts** 
	- pulmonary veins --> drive paroxysmal AF 
	- in atria --> atrial tachycardia 
- myocardial injury (ischemic or otherwise ) may alter cell character --> automaticity 
	- **border zones of infarcted ventricular myocardium, or rapidly reperfused ischemic myocardium**, often exhibit automatic arrhythmias including **PVCs or automatic idioventricular rhythms (AIVR)**
## Afterdepolarizations & Triggered Arrhythmia 
- abnormal depolarization in late phases of AP 
- Early Afterdepolarizations (EADs) in phases 2-3 --> facilitated by intracellular Ca loading --> QT prolongation in heterogeneous manner across ventricle --> trigger wavefront of abnormal depolarization --> **Torsades des pointes** 
- predisposing to TdP 
	- Medication prolonging QT 
	- hypokalemia 
	- hypomagnesemia 
	- bradycardia 
- Delayed Afterdepolarizations (DADs) --> in phase 4 --> increased intracellular Ca --> enhances repetitive depolarization in late phase --> bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. 
- causes of DADs 
	- Digitalis glycoside toxicity, 
	- ischemia 
	- catecholamines 
## Reentry 
- circus movement of a wavefront of electrical activation 
- fixed anatomic barrier --> **anatomic reentry** -- mc form 
- functional / refractory barrier or anchor --> **functional reentry**  
- prerequisite 
	- **unidirectional block** -- electric can propagate in 1 direction 
	- **slow conduction** -- zone in reentrant circuit with relatively slow conduction --> allowing the remainder of the circuit to repolarize and recover from refractoriness (the inability to re-excite) --> perpetual circus movement 
- if the total length of the circuit exceeds a distance determined by the **product of the conduction velocity (theta) of the tissue and the refractory period (duration) of that tissue (tr), referred to as the wavelength of tachycardia (lambda = theta × tr)**, an excitable gap, where tissue is recovered from refractory and able to depolarize, is created, allowing reentry 
- atrial flutter, AV nodal reentry, AV reciprocating tachycardia utilizing an accessory pathway, and scar-based reentrant VT (by anatomical reentry )
- **functional** --> no fixed anatomical barrier -->nidus of partially refractory tissue --> circular or rotational reentrant wavefront --> less stable than anatomical --> variation in depolarization rate and may easily terminate or reinitiate 
- AF, VF by functional reentry 
- Ischemia and infarct may create regions of heterogeneous fibrosis, resulting in islands of scar surrounded by injured tissue. This creates the anatomic substrate that can sustain anatomic reentry, which underlies scar-based VT, as well as many macro-reentrant atrial arrhythmias 
## Underpinning of treatment of arrhythmia 
- enhanced automaticity based --> target phase4 --> CCBs, beta blocker, ivabradine 
- trigger activity based arrhythmia 
	- correct precipitating factor 
	- remove digitalis 
	- remove QT prolonging drugs 
	- increase heart rate --> QT reduced 
- reentrant 
	- increase refractory period -- K channel blocker 
	- slow conduction velocity --> may paradoxical shorten wavelength of tachycardia --> increased excitable gap -- proarrhytmic effect

# Cellular Electrophysiology 
- cardiac action potential AP in 5 phases 0-4 
- phase 0 
	- rapid upstroke 
	- QRS 
	- Na current 
- phase 1-2 
	- ST segment 
	- 1 - activation of Ito with inactivation of the Na current
	- 2 - plateau , balance of repolarising K and depolarizing Ca currents 
- phase 3 
	- T wave 
	- deactivation of Ca and repolarisation by K (Ikr, Iks)
- phase 4 
	- end of T to start of QRS 
	- K current Ik1 
- P -- atrial depolarization 
- PR -- 
	- time between initiation of atrial depolarization to the initiation of ventricular depolarization
	- mainly conduction through AV node 
- Channels 
	- complex, multi-subunit transmembrane glycoproteins 
	- contains a central pore selective for ion species -- "gating" apparatus regulating the opening, closing, inactivation apparatus 
	- central pore 
		- P domain 
		- hydrophillic AA residues 
		- structural variants 
			- **four separate homologous alpha subunits**, each with homologous P domains (**voltage-gated K channels**)
			- **single alpha subunit** with four internally homologous P domains (**voltage-gated Na or Ca channels** 
			- **two internally homologous P domains from two separate subunits (most ligand- gated K channels)** 
	- voltage-gated channels 
		- 4th segment (of 6) -- S4 -- AAs function as voltage sensor --> cause changes in protein conformation --> gating 
	- Ligand-gated 
		- binding of a ligand (transmitters, molecules, or other ions) results in channel opening or closing, 
	- stretch-activated channels
		- deformations in membrane shape determine gating 
	- in many ion channels, a complex of **auxiliary proteins is associated with the primary alpha subunit**; most auxiliary subunits appear to **facilitate regulation of ion channel expression and activity.** 
	- Gap junction complex 
		- large multimeric complex of connexin subunits forms a large, nonselective pore that spans and thereby connects adjacent myocytes 
		- allows free flux of ions between adjacent myocytes, facilitating impulse propagation across myocardial tissues. 
- Na/Ca --> inward depolarising current 
- K --> outward repolarising current 
- Atrial/ ventricular myocytes 
	- Na --> phase1 of AP 
	- Na channel blockers -- treat tachyarrhythmia from atria and ventricles 
- nodal tissue --> Ca current --> slow phase 1 --> CCBs --> nodal tissue block 
- Funny current / If 
	- automaticity of sinus tissue --> gradual depolarization observed during phase 4, until a threshold is reached that initiates the next AP 
	- generated by a semiselective Na/Ca channel, termed the “funny current” or If, 
	- target for ivabradine.
# Normal Cardiac impulse Propagation 
- SA node --> RA -> LA --> atrial systole --> AV node --> relatively slow conduction --> bundle of His --> Right , Left bundle branches --> left anterio, left posterior fascicles --> Purkinje fibres (2-3m/s speed but in myocardial cells 0.3-0.4m/s)
# Mechanisms of cardiac Arrhythmia 
- Bradyarythmias from abnormalities in conduction tissues 
	- SA node - pathologic sinus bradycardia 
	- AV -- conduction block 
	- His-Purkinje system - conduction block 
- Tachyarrhythmia 
	- conduction tissues or even atria or ventricle 
	- **Enhanced Automaticity -- abnormal spontaneous depolarization**, which can occur along the conduction system, the atria, or ventricles
	- **Triggered arrhythmia -- abnormal afterdepolarizations** that occur in either **phase 2/3 (early afterdepolarizations)** or phase 4 (delayed afterdepolarizations) of the AP

# Cellular Electrophysiology 
- cardiac action potential AP in 5 phases 0-4 
- phase 0 
	- rapid upstroke 
	- QRS 
	- Na current 
- phase 1-2 
	- ST segment 
	- 1 - activation of Ito with inactivation of the Na current
	- 2 - plateau , balance of repolarising K and depolarizing Ca currents 
- phase 3 
	- T wave 
	- deactivation of Ca and repolarisation by K (Ikr, I)
- phase 4 
	- end of T to start of QRS 
- P -- atrial depolarization 
- PR -- 
	- time between initiation of atrial depolarization to the initiation of ventricular depolarization
	- mainly conduction through AV node
